The Chairman, Deputy Sean Fleming, sends his apologies that he cannot attend today.<\/p><p>We will take the business of the committee at the meeting next Thursday.<br\/><br\/>Today, we will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts both for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and dealing specifically with the internal audit of financial procedures in the Garda College.  The committee met to deal with this matter on 4 May, 31 May and 13 June.  Today, the committee will engage with the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is the Accounting Officer.  The second session of the committee today will take place at 7 p.m. with the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The focus of today's meeting will be what has happened since 2015, the interim audit report and its implementation.  As was the case at the previous meeting, I ask that members and witnesses co-operate in this regard.  Representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na present include the sole witness for this session, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  She is supported by the deputy commissioner in charge of governance and strategy, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in;  Mr. John Twomey, deputy commissioner; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administration officer; Superintendent Marie Broderick, private secretary to the Commissioner; Inspector Darren McCarthy of the office of the Commissioner; and Mr. Andrew McAlinden, director of communications.  All are very welcome.  We are again joined by Ms Anne Barry of the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br\/><br\/>I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if she is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br\/><br\/>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>We are joined by the people I have mentioned.  The Commissioner will be the sole witness in this session.  She is supported by those around her.  However, no questions will be directed at anyone other than the Commissioner.  If she needs to confer with any of those with her today, she may do so in regard to answering questions but no evidence will be given by anyone other than the Commissioner.  I ask the Commissioner to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#D00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wish to provide the Vice Chairman and members with an update on resolving the unacceptable financial issues in the Garda College found in the interim audit report by the Garda internal audit service.  This is in addition to the actions that I advised the committee have been taken following the receipt by the Garda executive of the draft interim audit report in September 2016.  As members are aware, these issues have their origin in the funding model set up for the Garda College several decades ago.  These are very complex and complicated financial and legal arrangements that in some cases require us to take expert advice to resolve them and ensure they cannot happen again.  Notwithstanding this, we are determined to resolve them as quickly as possible as they clearly do not meet modern corporate governance or financial standards.  All of the recommendations of the interim audit report will be implemented and we are happy to provide periodic updates on our progress to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Policing Authority and the independent Garda audit committee.  On that note, I wish to advise the committee that on Friday of last week the head of the Garda internal audit section provided me with a verbal briefing on concerns he had in regard to particular financial matters relating to activities in the Garda College.  Following this meeting, I requested that a written report from the internal audit service be provided on Monday.  I reviewed the report yesterday and, based on the information available, the matter has now been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for investigation.  I am also conscious that the Garda internal audit section is continuing its audit of the Garda College and any further issues that may arise as that audit progresses will be addressed and appropriate action taken by the Garda executive.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, those accompanying me are available to assist the committee in any way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for her opening statement.

It was quite evident from reading the content of the letter that there was, when I called it &quot;an interpersonal dispute&quot;, a difference of opinion in the way that Mr. Barrett was handling things and Mr. Culhane's perception of that and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It involved a number of other parties.  To my mind, what it highlighted was the interpersonal differences between two individuals operating in the same line of management and, most importantly, who had key roles to play in actually fixing the issues at hand.  To come to Mr. Barrett, quite rightly he did what was proper and appropriate in bringing the matters to the attention of his then line manager, Mr. Dunne.  That was back when he did do that.  Then, Mr. Dunne was dealing with these matters and this letter comes into play.  It was evident to me at that stage that here were two key people who actually had key roles to play in fixing these issues, which we had committed to doing.  My focus was on making sure that those issues were dealt with and that any differences between these two individuals were resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>When Mr. Dunne was here last week, he was asked about the timing of referring what he had found to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When we asked the Comptroller and Auditor General whether that was his understanding of how it should have happened or if it was the correct timing, he said it should have been referred immediately or very soon after it came to light.  When one looks at the McGee report of 2008, it was given to Mr. Culhane who then had full knowledge.  The genesis of the most recent report comes from that 2008 report.  Mr. Culhane was aware of that.  The internal auditor was not given the appropriate information.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General has done a very helpful report for us on where the rights and responsibilities are, including those of the Accounting Officer.  It is document No. DE0075GCT, page 9 of 12.  At paragraph 60, it states that the internal audit function must operate freely and objectively.  It says that this requires the full support of management, a sufficient organisational status for the function, and execution by the internal audit unit of work in a manner which is and is perceived to be objective and professional.  The material was deliberately withheld and the internal auditor told us that until Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took his position, he had been frustrated in getting material.  Given that there is a potential fraud - and it is nothing more than a potential at this stage - withholding information is also potentially a disciplinary matter.

At the outset, let us look at the exploration of the questioning that has been happening over a series of these meetings relating to Templemore and its importance to public discourse.  In the complexities of some of the questions that are being thrown at the Commissioner, that and why this probing is happening is sometimes lost.  Specifically, I think it is best encapsulated by the document, \"A Critical Inflection Point\" which she referenced earlier and was written on 29 September 2015.<\/p><p>Mr. Barrett, when writing to the CAO, expressed his concern about the scale and amount of co-mingled moneys at Templemore - some &euro;12 million over ten years and a total of &euro;2.3 million in investment accounts at its peak - and the confirmation that no refund was made at year-end from the surpluses generated.  This is a point to which Mr. Kelly referred in his presentation to the committee when he said Deputy Commissioner Rice stated in a note in 2009 \"I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of AGS\".  He pointed out that this had occurred since the position of Accounting Officer had been bestowed on the holder of the office of Commissioner in 2005.  This is the crucial point in years when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needed a substantial Supplementary Estimate from the Exchequer.  We are not just interested in exploring bad processes here because this had a direct impact on the taxpayer.  This was effectively a bailout.  Substantial surpluses were being generated yet, as pointed out in \"A Critical Inflection Point\", this was at a time when Supplementary Estimates were needed as well.  The Commissioner mentioned her 36 years on the force.  While she was not Commissioner at the time in question, can Ms O'Sullivan explain how these belief systems came into being such that people were of the view that surpluses generated did not belong to the State but rather to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when Supplementary Estimates from the taxpayer were required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#AA06500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>To clarify in respect of Mr. Barrett's &quot;A Critical Inflection Point&quot;, the first I saw of that document was when it was here at the first committee meeting I believe.  As a point of record, it is very disadvantageous to be asked to read documents in a committee room in the course of a meeting.  It would have been preferable to have had the opportunity to see the documents beforehand and it would be much better from a learning point of view if they were all shared with the witnesses beforehand.  It is very difficult for me to get into the mindsets of people but I can say that the historical context is that this was a funding model established some time around the time of the Walsh report in the 1980s.  It was a very complex structure at the time with the <i>per capita<\/i>grants being given.

I have a letter that was referred to earlier, which refers to Mr. Barrett and was written by Mr. Culhane.  It was sent to the Commissioner and deputy commissioners and is dated 24 October 2015.  It is pretty excoriating in respect of Mr. Barrett.  I think Ms O'Sullivan would recognise that the language is pretty choice and dramatic.  The interesting thing is that the title of the letter sent is \"Re Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act section 41 - Garda College\".  I find it very interesting that Mr. Culhane is having a right go at Mr. Barrett, up to and including suggesting that he may have broken the Official Secrets Act and all sorts, and defending his honour.<\/p> <p>  He was quite aggressive in respect of Mr. Barrett and stated Mr. Barrett thought he was responsible for the devil and all and that it is all his fault.  Is it not interesting that this is how he highlights the matter?  He does not explicitly say anywhere that a disclosure should not be made.  If one read the letter, one would have to imagine it was designed not just to take a pop at Mr. Barrett, but also to dissuade any notion of making that disclosure. <\/p> <p>  He states: \"I refer to the ongoing issues concerning the Garda college which recently culminated in a minute from the head of legal affairs [that is our friend, Mr. Ruane] based upon partial and inaccurate representations made by Mr. John Barrett advising the Commissioner to make a section 41 disclosure to the Minister.\"  Although he never says in the text that a disclosure should not be made, if it landed on my desk I would read it as an attempt to persuade me not to make that disclosure.

He, in turn, was obviously corresponding or in contact with Eugene Banks of the Garda division in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am extremely troubled by one of the emails dated 5 July 2010 that was sent at 17.26.  It seems to be a response to Eugene Banks, in the Garda division, who inquired whether there had been any developments on the matters raised below, in particular, the relationship between the college and the companies and the legal entity of the college itself.  Mr. Culhane responded:<\/p><blockquote>Eugene <br \/><br \/>There have been no further developments.  To muddy things up, I included charitable status for the College in the letter to the Revenue dated 28<sup>th<\/sup>May but as you can see it was not included in their response.<\/blockquote> <p>We do not have the response.  I wish to refer to the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of all the evidence we have received so far - the conflicting evidence from certain parties.  For a finance director to use the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of any correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners and inform Eugene Banks from the Department of Justice and Equality seems to suggest an awful lot, Commissioner.

I am concerned that back in 2011, a number of issues were raised in that correspondence, including the need to reduce urgently the number of bank accounts by 13.  To any reasonable person without any major financial knowledge, if one talks of reducing the number of bank accounts by such a significant quantity, it would suggest there is a big operation at play.  Other issues raised in the correspondence were the urgent need for new accounting procedures, all accounts to be audited, and if the financial director at that time, Mr. Culhane, had checked that the accounts were audited.  For example, the bar account had not been audited at that stage.  Will the Commissioner comment on this?

Clearly, this information was in the hands of the Garda's financial director, who is accountable to this committee, in 2011 and it was in the hands of the internal auditor who has conducted an audit of the Garda.  For the life of me, I cannot see what has changed since.  Why are people not being held to account in their roles?

The Commissioner categorised what happened between Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane as an interpersonal and issue and referred the matter to Mr. Dunne, the CAO.  Given that Mr. Barrett was head of human resources, I would expect he would understand if something was an interpersonal issue.  It would be part of the discipline and part of the reason he was recruited into his role would have been that he had considerable experience.<\/p> <p>  I would like to return to the governance architecture.  This is not about a team.  The internal audit, audit committee and head of finance are not a team.  Tensions are expected in this architecture which is, or should be, designed with tensions, albeit not to the extent that people beat each other up or anything.  It is not an interpersonal matter and should not be categorised as such, given Mr. Barrett's background and given that this friction is intended.  One can introduce all the recommendations one likes but if this matter is viewed as people having a working relationship with one other that does not work well, I have serious concerns about whether this architecture will provide the protection to which the Garda Commissioner repeatedly refers.  She keeps referring to checks and balances.  What is it about these checks and balances that are different and will not be able to overcome a difficulty that is described as interpersonal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#NN00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Maybe I explained this earlier and if I did not, let me explain it again now.  The Deputy is perfectly right; there is the architecture and there are the key individuals and the key roles within that architecture, such as, for example, the head of internal audit unit, the director of finance, the chair of the audit committee and the deputy commissioner who is in charge of our risk governance board.  That is the architecture that I see and that is where we are revising and reviewing that architecture to ensure the regularity and propriety of it to make sure it is working effectively in the way that we want it.<\/p> <p>  Separately, there is the team and the individuals we refer to are all part of the senior leadership team.  As well as being involved in the architecture, they are absolutely key players in delivering on not just our reform programme, but also the goals and objectives that we have to deal with every single day.  I am very concerned that there are these tensions between these key individuals.  As I said earlier, it is our job to work to make sure that we work through these difficulties, that we make the most effective use of the team and that the architecture and the skill set are there to support that team in delivering on their individual and collective missions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>It was not just an interpersonal issue in the case of Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Kelly, in his opening statement, which I am sure the Garda Commissioner had read when she appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago, drew our attention to the reasons he was not able to do his job.  He referred, for example, to the attitude to the public money that was provided for recruits and, for example, to Deputy Commissioner Rice's attitude to what that money was for.  In fact, I asked Ms Anne Marie McMahon, whose rank I cannot recall, and Mr. Pat McCabe about this and they were both of the opinion that this money was for more than the upkeep of the members in relation to the restaurant.  That must have come from somewhere.  Mr. Kelly's opening statement was littered with comments, including, for example, that he now knew he was misinformed and that Mr. Culhane had questioned his motives.  Deputy Cullinane raised this matter earlier.  Mr. Kelly's statement features many comments setting out how he was frustrated in doing his job.  This was not just an interpersonal problem.  A range of different players are involved in this and it is very important that it is not seen as an interpersonal problem.<\/p> <p>  A number of different audit committees have operated since the function of Accounting Officer transferred from the Department to the Commissioner.

This morning she used the same word but she signed a letter to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 31 July, which is certainly after she became aware.  She said, \"I have disclosed to you [the Comptroller and Auditor General] all instances of loss, fraud or irregularity\" that were known to her.  She goes on that, \"where such instances [including irregularities] are known to me I have reported them to you\".  It strikes me that she did not do this.  It is quite obvious that the Commissioner did not report these to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Can the Vice Chairman tell me if this letter, which was given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, is inaccurate?

Notwithstanding the fact that the system and practices at Templemore college date back decades, we have not had from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collectively a coherent or credible account or response in terms of what happened.  I am not referring in the first instance to how all of these practices became established, convoluted and so on.  Everyone accepts the interim audit report and all of the criticisms therein, some of them very serious, including in regard to the Commissioner.<\/p><p>We have not managed to unravel what was happening within senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. McGee, a colleague of Ms O'Sullivan, was before the committee last week and I explored with him an email he had sent to Mr. Barrett.  In the email he addresses his report of 2008 and says the best thing is to deal with the matter quietly.  The best thing is to keep it out of the Committee of Public Accounts and away from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I asked him if this was his preferred way of dealing with things, if it was his idea and did the idea of keeping things quiet originate with him.  I did not get an answer to that.  I think he felt very much put on the spot.  I would not be persuaded that Mr. McGee, given his level within the organisation, came up with this strategy.  He is a very competent person, I have no doubt, but he is not, in relative terms, a very senior person.  I think the evidence reflects that it was the approach taken.  <\/p><p> I will put the next question to the Commissioner because I really want to know what was happening here.  She inherited this situation.  I do not think anybody disputes that even though Ms O'Sullivan is a long-serving officer.  As Commissioner she inherited this.  What I cannot understand is the lack of decisive action on her part.  What I am trying to understand is whether she simply fell into the same mindset as her colleagues, perhaps because she has such long service, I do not know, and whether she was persuaded by colleagues to go along with this \"softly, softly, say nothing, sort it out and regularise matters\" approach.  I want Ms O'Sullivan to help me to understand that.  I just want to make clear it is the reason I raise the issue of gender.  I am very struck that Ms O'Sullivan is a trailblazer in many respects.  She is the first woman in this job, in the most senior position.  She is in charge.  If there was a dynamic around that, I would like to know whether that happened and whether it was a factor.  If it is not a factor, she should simply tell us it was not a factor and not an issue and that is fine.  Ms O'Sullivan needs to give us an explanation beyond the well-trodden ground of \"I heard about this in July and I did this\".   She has had ample questioning from colleagues which demonstrates that a letter Ms O'Sullivan wrote or signed off on to the Comptroller and Auditor General was misleading.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said he believes in his position, in the constitutional office he holds, that he did not get the full information that would have enabled him to carry out his function.  I hope I am not misrepresenting the position.  We have not had an adequate or convincing explanation from Ms O'Sullivan as the leader and person in charge as to why those things happened.  I want to give Ms O'Sullivan an opportunity to explain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#RR00400","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>There are a lot of points in the Deputy's question so maybe I will deal with them in rotation and if I leave something out the Deputy might come back to it.  First, in Mr. Kelly's interim audit report, I am not aware of criticisms of me personally.  I am very familiar with the report.  I am quite happy to go through those if the Deputy wishes.  The point I would make on Mr. McGee's appearance here at the committee is that he appeared here as a voluntary witness to assist the committee and he, as other witnesses, is an office holder.  My understanding is he was forthright and open with the committee in respect of his interactions on the email I see here on the screen.  I cannot get into the mindset of Mr. McGee as to why he authored this email.  What I can say is the Deputy asked about decisive action.  I am very clear and I have always been very clear on my decisive action around matters such as this.  My decision is they need to be actioned.  What was very clear to me, when these matters were brought to my attention and in the days subsequent to 27 July, was that there had been, on perusal of files of my office, interactions with a number of different offices.  There had been interactions with the Department and with outside external advisers to try to fix these issues.  What I was not cited on is what had been done.  Part of the purpose of the committee we established was to gather all of that information and to compile and collate it and find out what precisely had been done.  It was very clear in the correspondence I saw at that time that the then Commissioner had issued instructions.  What I was not clear on was whether those instructions had been acted upon or not.  On the completion of Mr. Kelly's draft interim report in September 2016, it was evident that some of these actions and what had been agreed by the Commissioner, both in 2008 and 2010, were not actioned.  It was important in my mindset that we got a complete picture.  I also want to be clear - I am sure the Deputy will appreciate this - that I absolutely respect the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I absolutely respect the parliamentary position of this committee.  What I have said is we are all of the time learning lessons.  We have learned lessons from this process.  I have heard quite clearly and very carefully considered what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  At that time, my mindset was we needed to be in possession of complete information to be able to make an informed decision and to be able to fully inform everybody who needed to be informed of precisely what had been done.  We were dealing, as the Deputy said, with four-decade old structures.  Nobody knew what had been done and nobody gave us succinct answers about what had been done.  The collation exercise was to make sure we had complete information.  I respect what the Comptroller and Auditor General says, that his office would be willing to accept partial information and that is a lesson.  From here on in - and even before now - partial information will be supplied.

However, I can say that in 2015, once the matters were brought to our attention, immediate action was taken to put in place structures and mechanisms to unravel this very complicated architecture and accounting system that had grown up over four decades and to put in place the necessary structures and processes that would ensure it could never happen again.  I know the Deputy may not have been here earlier on, but I gave evidence to the committee through my colleague, Mr. Nugent, who I appointed to chair a steering group to ensure that the 19 recommendations of the interim audit report were fully implemented.  Mr. Nugent has given assurances through me to the committee.  We had an implementation deadline of June of this year.  Due to advices that we are continuing to be in receipt of and the complexities of some of the issues that we need to do, basically they will now be completed by the end of December 2017.

I do not know whether this was raised already, so I apologise if I am repeating anything, but I want to know what happened.  I will read from the second-last paragraph, which is the only issue I wish to raise: &quot;I believe that the Head of Internal Audit has acted in good faith.  Therefore I have to treat an accusation to the contrary as a very serious issue of principle.&quot;  This is the letter that we could not date, but it was just prior to his departure in April 2017.

We dealt with this matter earlier, but I welcome the opportunity to deal with it again.  I wish to emphasise to the committee that, when the document was received, I had legal advices through the CAO regarding the best mechanism to deal with this process.  That process is ongoing.  The legal advices have been received in recent days and we now have a mechanism that we are following to do exactly what it says here.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the fair procedure and due process that must be afforded to all parties involved.  There is a process that we have been advised to follow.  However, I want to make a point regarding something that Deputy McDonald raised.  Some inference may have been drawn to the effect that I was not dealing with this matter personally.  As most of those present who are executives of organisations know, there is a segregation of duties in an organisation.  Deputy McDonald asked whether there were different disciplinary processes, etc.  There are, but an important segregation of duties is also maintained.  Given that I, as Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, may have to be the arbiter or adjudicator on a matter, there must be a segregation of duties between the line managers who deal with this because the ultimate decision may be mine.  For example, it may be my decision that a matter should be referred to a different forum.<\/p> <p>  Maybe I did not explain it well earlier, but I want to be clear for the purpose of the record.  It was not me deflecting or delegating something that it was not appropriate to delegate.  It is quite the opposite.  It is appropriate, lawful and procedurally correct and proper that I would delegate that function to the line manager, where the process will take place, and the matter may end up on my desk as decision-maker regarding what needs to be done next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#XX05000","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>Do you have a final question Deputy Murphy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#YY00100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>Going back to the Cabra account, I want to clear something up for myself.

It refers to Mr. Culhane's letter about the draft report, a very serious letter.  What we as a committee were concerned about in the previous meetings was the question as to whether efforts were made by senior Garda management to in some way block what was being carried out by internal audit.  That is why we took a serious view of that letter and the whole tone of it.  Mr. Culhane did in fact withdraw parts of it here in public session at the last meeting.   We are now at the end of our public hearings and we will want to do a report in the coming weeks.  We have indicated that we want to know, and we asked Mr. Nugent the last day, what the response was to that letter.  The Commissioner says that that is still being considered and we have not got a response.  That puts us as a committee in a position that, as of now, that letter still stands as it was written as a reflection of a senior manager's view on what the internal audit was doing.  As of now, nobody has seen fit to respond to us and tell us that that is not reflective of senior Garda management.<\/p> <p>  We will need a response very promptly on the Commissioner's view on that letter.

It is a function that used to be carried out by the Minister and now the authority does it, so we have a relationship with the chair of the audit committee.  I spoke to him around June or July.  I have been trying to remember; I do not have a detailed note.  In the course of that conversation, I was satisfied that the audit committee was aware of the matter.

Mr. O'Callaghan telephoned me to tell me for the first time about this internal audit because by then the draft audit report had been circulated.  It was a courtesy call to simply let us know that it existed because he expected that it might find its way into the media and he did not want us to be surprised.<\/p> <p>  The following day the deputy commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, contacted the chief executive in similar vein.  I briefed the authority informally the following week at our monthly meeting and there it rested because we took the view that an internal audit belongs within the organisation.  It was under the auspices of the audit committee.  I got one of my colleagues in the authority to contact the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm the Comptroller and Auditor General's office knew about it.  We said the system is working; the machinery is doing what it should be doing.  We stepped back until the final audit report was published.<\/p><p>In the intervening months, to be fair to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they did offer us some briefing notes in relation to the audit, but we declined.  We took the view that we really wanted the final audit report and not to get something just from the management side.  We felt that the notes would not have been helpful to us.  That is more or less the sequence.  The final audit report was then published and immediately, or very shortly, after its publication the Minister for Justice and Equality referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and we have been doing that with regular meetings with Mr. Nugent and his team to make sure the implementation of the recommendations is proceeding.  I was keeping an eye on this discussion this morning and I was a bit disappointed to hear Mr. Nugent say that the timeline for some of the recommendations is drifting towards the end of the year.  While I understand that some of the recommendations are complex they are not all complex and so this was a bit disappointing.<\/p><p> I shall now turn to the next sequence, in the context of the Policing Authority's consideration of this matter.  We had our regular meeting in Templemore last month and we were aware that this committee was going to have a series of significant hearings.  We were aware that Mr. Kelly was doing a next phase, so we decided that the most prudent thing we could do was to continue to oversee the implementation of the previous recommendations, wait for Mr. Kelly's next instalment and wait for the work of this committee.  I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General is obviously looking at matters to do with his audit and the appropriation account.  We decided to review matters in September to see if there was any other gap that the Policing Authority should involve itself in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#ZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>At this stage, speakers have indicated in the following order: Deputies Marc MacSharry, Catherine Connolly, Alan Kelly, David Cullinane and Catherine Murphy.

Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit, stated that his work was interfered with, there was non-co-operation and that information was withheld.  In his opening statement to this committee some weeks ago he said the head of the finance directorate of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attempted to get him to change his opinion, findings and recommendations and threatened him with legal action.  Mr. Barrett, the head of human resources, spoke about a cover up.  Mr. Kelly spoke about the circling of the wagons and claimed he was duped.  We heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General that he was not informed in any year from 2006 to 2015.  Mr. Kelly sought copies of the 2008 and 2010 reports and never got them.  What is Ms Feehily's response to all that, given that her job is to implement recommendations?

It is unusual for them to be in statute.  Most Government agencies have heads of internal audit and audit committees without needing a legal framework, so there is an extra layer of protection.  There is the internal audit, with the committee to oversee it to protect the auditor from interference.  We appoint the committee.  I have met the outgoing and incoming chairpersons.  I have arranged with them that they will develop a closer relationship between that committee and the authority and will formally change the audit committee charter to formalise a closer relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na audit committee and the authority to make sure we can have a good line of sight on the work of the audit committee.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that structure is designed to protect the internal audit function from interference.  As I was following some of the proceedings of the committee today, it seems that in the end, in a letter from the outgoing chair of the audit committee, he intervened to do what the audit committee should do to protect the internal auditor.

He and his office are independent, as they must be within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because he has a specific job to do.  We also know that a report was prepared in 2015 for Mr. Dunne, who was to brief the audit committee in June or July of that year, but he did not do so until September and raised the issue under any other business.  It would seem, on the face of it, that Mr. Kelly did not get the co-operation he needed.  Maybe he was right and there was a circling of the wagons.
