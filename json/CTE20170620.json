The Chairman, Deputy Sean Fleming, sends his apologies that he cannot attend today.<\/p><p>We will take the business of the committee at the meeting next Thursday.<br\/><br\/>Today, we will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts both for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and dealing specifically with the internal audit of financial procedures in the Garda College.  The committee met to deal with this matter on 4 May, 31 May and 13 June.  Today, the committee will engage with the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is the Accounting Officer.  The second session of the committee today will take place at 7 p.m. with the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The focus of today's meeting will be what has happened since 2015, the interim audit report and its implementation.  As was the case at the previous meeting, I ask that members and witnesses co-operate in this regard.  Representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na present include the sole witness for this session, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  She is supported by the deputy commissioner in charge of governance and strategy, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in;  Mr. John Twomey, deputy commissioner; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administration officer; Superintendent Marie Broderick, private secretary to the Commissioner; Inspector Darren McCarthy of the office of the Commissioner; and Mr. Andrew McAlinden, director of communications.  All are very welcome.  We are again joined by Ms Anne Barry of the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br\/><br\/>I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if she is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br\/><br\/>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>We are joined by the people I have mentioned.  The Commissioner will be the sole witness in this session.  She is supported by those around her.  However, no questions will be directed at anyone other than the Commissioner.  If she needs to confer with any of those with her today, she may do so in regard to answering questions but no evidence will be given by anyone other than the Commissioner.  I ask the Commissioner to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#D00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wish to provide the Vice Chairman and members with an update on resolving the unacceptable financial issues in the Garda College found in the interim audit report by the Garda internal audit service.  This is in addition to the actions that I advised the committee have been taken following the receipt by the Garda executive of the draft interim audit report in September 2016.  As members are aware, these issues have their origin in the funding model set up for the Garda College several decades ago.  These are very complex and complicated financial and legal arrangements that in some cases require us to take expert advice to resolve them and ensure they cannot happen again.  Notwithstanding this, we are determined to resolve them as quickly as possible as they clearly do not meet modern corporate governance or financial standards.  All of the recommendations of the interim audit report will be implemented and we are happy to provide periodic updates on our progress to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Policing Authority and the independent Garda audit committee.  On that note, I wish to advise the committee that on Friday of last week the head of the Garda internal audit section provided me with a verbal briefing on concerns he had in regard to particular financial matters relating to activities in the Garda College.  Following this meeting, I requested that a written report from the internal audit service be provided on Monday.  I reviewed the report yesterday and, based on the information available, the matter has now been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for investigation.  I am also conscious that the Garda internal audit section is continuing its audit of the Garda College and any further issues that may arise as that audit progresses will be addressed and appropriate action taken by the Garda executive.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, those accompanying me are available to assist the committee in any way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for her opening statement.

It was quite evident from reading the content of the letter that there was, when I called it &quot;an interpersonal dispute&quot;, a difference of opinion in the way that Mr. Barrett was handling things and Mr. Culhane's perception of that and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It involved a number of other parties.  To my mind, what it highlighted was the interpersonal differences between two individuals operating in the same line of management and, most importantly, who had key roles to play in actually fixing the issues at hand.  To come to Mr. Barrett, quite rightly he did what was proper and appropriate in bringing the matters to the attention of his then line manager, Mr. Dunne.  That was back when he did do that.  Then, Mr. Dunne was dealing with these matters and this letter comes into play.  It was evident to me at that stage that here were two key people who actually had key roles to play in fixing these issues, which we had committed to doing.  My focus was on making sure that those issues were dealt with and that any differences between these two individuals were resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>When Mr. Dunne was here last week, he was asked about the timing of referring what he had found to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When we asked the Comptroller and Auditor General whether that was his understanding of how it should have happened or if it was the correct timing, he said it should have been referred immediately or very soon after it came to light.  When one looks at the McGee report of 2008, it was given to Mr. Culhane who then had full knowledge.  The genesis of the most recent report comes from that 2008 report.  Mr. Culhane was aware of that.  The internal auditor was not given the appropriate information.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General has done a very helpful report for us on where the rights and responsibilities are, including those of the Accounting Officer.  It is document No. DE0075GCT, page 9 of 12.  At paragraph 60, it states that the internal audit function must operate freely and objectively.  It says that this requires the full support of management, a sufficient organisational status for the function, and execution by the internal audit unit of work in a manner which is and is perceived to be objective and professional.  The material was deliberately withheld and the internal auditor told us that until Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took his position, he had been frustrated in getting material.  Given that there is a potential fraud - and it is nothing more than a potential at this stage - withholding information is also potentially a disciplinary matter.

At the outset, let us look at the exploration of the questioning that has been happening over a series of these meetings relating to Templemore and its importance to public discourse.  In the complexities of some of the questions that are being thrown at the Commissioner, that and why this probing is happening is sometimes lost.  Specifically, I think it is best encapsulated by the document, \"A Critical Inflection Point\" which she referenced earlier and was written on 29 September 2015.<\/p><p>Mr. Barrett, when writing to the CAO, expressed his concern about the scale and amount of co-mingled moneys at Templemore - some &euro;12 million over ten years and a total of &euro;2.3 million in investment accounts at its peak - and the confirmation that no refund was made at year-end from the surpluses generated.  This is a point to which Mr. Kelly referred in his presentation to the committee when he said Deputy Commissioner Rice stated in a note in 2009 \"I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of AGS\".  He pointed out that this had occurred since the position of Accounting Officer had been bestowed on the holder of the office of Commissioner in 2005.  This is the crucial point in years when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needed a substantial Supplementary Estimate from the Exchequer.  We are not just interested in exploring bad processes here because this had a direct impact on the taxpayer.  This was effectively a bailout.  Substantial surpluses were being generated yet, as pointed out in \"A Critical Inflection Point\", this was at a time when Supplementary Estimates were needed as well.  The Commissioner mentioned her 36 years on the force.  While she was not Commissioner at the time in question, can Ms O'Sullivan explain how these belief systems came into being such that people were of the view that surpluses generated did not belong to the State but rather to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when Supplementary Estimates from the taxpayer were required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#AA06500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>To clarify in respect of Mr. Barrett's &quot;A Critical Inflection Point&quot;, the first I saw of that document was when it was here at the first committee meeting I believe.  As a point of record, it is very disadvantageous to be asked to read documents in a committee room in the course of a meeting.  It would have been preferable to have had the opportunity to see the documents beforehand and it would be much better from a learning point of view if they were all shared with the witnesses beforehand.  It is very difficult for me to get into the mindsets of people but I can say that the historical context is that this was a funding model established some time around the time of the Walsh report in the 1980s.  It was a very complex structure at the time with the <i>per capita<\/i>grants being given.

I have a letter that was referred to earlier, which refers to Mr. Barrett and was written by Mr. Culhane.  It was sent to the Commissioner and deputy commissioners and is dated 24 October 2015.  It is pretty excoriating in respect of Mr. Barrett.  I think Ms O'Sullivan would recognise that the language is pretty choice and dramatic.  The interesting thing is that the title of the letter sent is \"Re Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act section 41 - Garda College\".  I find it very interesting that Mr. Culhane is having a right go at Mr. Barrett, up to and including suggesting that he may have broken the Official Secrets Act and all sorts, and defending his honour.<\/p> <p>  He was quite aggressive in respect of Mr. Barrett and stated Mr. Barrett thought he was responsible for the devil and all and that it is all his fault.  Is it not interesting that this is how he highlights the matter?  He does not explicitly say anywhere that a disclosure should not be made.  If one read the letter, one would have to imagine it was designed not just to take a pop at Mr. Barrett, but also to dissuade any notion of making that disclosure. <\/p> <p>  He states: \"I refer to the ongoing issues concerning the Garda college which recently culminated in a minute from the head of legal affairs [that is our friend, Mr. Ruane] based upon partial and inaccurate representations made by Mr. John Barrett advising the Commissioner to make a section 41 disclosure to the Minister.\"  Although he never says in the text that a disclosure should not be made, if it landed on my desk I would read it as an attempt to persuade me not to make that disclosure.

He, in turn, was obviously corresponding or in contact with Eugene Banks of the Garda division in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am extremely troubled by one of the emails dated 5 July 2010 that was sent at 17.26.  It seems to be a response to Eugene Banks, in the Garda division, who inquired whether there had been any developments on the matters raised below, in particular, the relationship between the college and the companies and the legal entity of the college itself.  Mr. Culhane responded:<\/p><blockquote>Eugene <br \/><br \/>There have been no further developments.  To muddy things up, I included charitable status for the College in the letter to the Revenue dated 28<sup>th<\/sup>May but as you can see it was not included in their response.<\/blockquote> <p>We do not have the response.  I wish to refer to the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of all the evidence we have received so far - the conflicting evidence from certain parties.  For a finance director to use the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of any correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners and inform Eugene Banks from the Department of Justice and Equality seems to suggest an awful lot, Commissioner.

I am concerned that back in 2011, a number of issues were raised in that correspondence, including the need to reduce urgently the number of bank accounts by 13.  To any reasonable person without any major financial knowledge, if one talks of reducing the number of bank accounts by such a significant quantity, it would suggest there is a big operation at play.  Other issues raised in the correspondence were the urgent need for new accounting procedures, all accounts to be audited, and if the financial director at that time, Mr. Culhane, had checked that the accounts were audited.  For example, the bar account had not been audited at that stage.  Will the Commissioner comment on this?

Clearly, this information was in the hands of the Garda's financial director, who is accountable to this committee, in 2011 and it was in the hands of the internal auditor who has conducted an audit of the Garda.  For the life of me, I cannot see what has changed since.  Why are people not being held to account in their roles?

The Commissioner categorised what happened between Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane as an interpersonal and issue and referred the matter to Mr. Dunne, the CAO.  Given that Mr. Barrett was head of human resources, I would expect he would understand if something was an interpersonal issue.  It would be part of the discipline and part of the reason he was recruited into his role would have been that he had considerable experience.<\/p> <p>  I would like to return to the governance architecture.  This is not about a team.  The internal audit, audit committee and head of finance are not a team.  Tensions are expected in this architecture which is, or should be, designed with tensions, albeit not to the extent that people beat each other up or anything.  It is not an interpersonal matter and should not be categorised as such, given Mr. Barrett's background and given that this friction is intended.  One can introduce all the recommendations one likes but if this matter is viewed as people having a working relationship with one other that does not work well, I have serious concerns about whether this architecture will provide the protection to which the Garda Commissioner repeatedly refers.  She keeps referring to checks and balances.  What is it about these checks and balances that are different and will not be able to overcome a difficulty that is described as interpersonal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#NN00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Maybe I explained this earlier and if I did not, let me explain it again now.  The Deputy is perfectly right; there is the architecture and there are the key individuals and the key roles within that architecture, such as, for example, the head of internal audit unit, the director of finance, the chair of the audit committee and the deputy commissioner who is in charge of our risk governance board.  That is the architecture that I see and that is where we are revising and reviewing that architecture to ensure the regularity and propriety of it to make sure it is working effectively in the way that we want it.<\/p> <p>  Separately, there is the team and the individuals we refer to are all part of the senior leadership team.  As well as being involved in the architecture, they are absolutely key players in delivering on not just our reform programme, but also the goals and objectives that we have to deal with every single day.  I am very concerned that there are these tensions between these key individuals.  As I said earlier, it is our job to work to make sure that we work through these difficulties, that we make the most effective use of the team and that the architecture and the skill set are there to support that team in delivering on their individual and collective missions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>It was not just an interpersonal issue in the case of Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Kelly, in his opening statement, which I am sure the Garda Commissioner had read when she appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago, drew our attention to the reasons he was not able to do his job.  He referred, for example, to the attitude to the public money that was provided for recruits and, for example, to Deputy Commissioner Rice's attitude to what that money was for.  In fact, I asked Ms Anne Marie McMahon, whose rank I cannot recall, and Mr. Pat McCabe about this and they were both of the opinion that this money was for more than the upkeep of the members in relation to the restaurant.  That must have come from somewhere.  Mr. Kelly's opening statement was littered with comments, including, for example, that he now knew he was misinformed and that Mr. Culhane had questioned his motives.  Deputy Cullinane raised this matter earlier.  Mr. Kelly's statement features many comments setting out how he was frustrated in doing his job.  This was not just an interpersonal problem.  A range of different players are involved in this and it is very important that it is not seen as an interpersonal problem.<\/p> <p>  A number of different audit committees have operated since the function of Accounting Officer transferred from the Department to the Commissioner.

This morning she used the same word but she signed a letter to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 31 July, which is certainly after she became aware.  She said, \"I have disclosed to you [the Comptroller and Auditor General] all instances of loss, fraud or irregularity\" that were known to her.  She goes on that, \"where such instances [including irregularities] are known to me I have reported them to you\".  It strikes me that she did not do this.  It is quite obvious that the Commissioner did not report these to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Can the Vice Chairman tell me if this letter, which was given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, is inaccurate?

Notwithstanding the fact that the system and practices at Templemore college date back decades, we have not had from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collectively a coherent or credible account or response in terms of what happened.  I am not referring in the first instance to how all of these practices became established, convoluted and so on.  Everyone accepts the interim audit report and all of the criticisms therein, some of them very serious, including in regard to the Commissioner.<\/p><p>We have not managed to unravel what was happening within senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. McGee, a colleague of Ms O'Sullivan, was before the committee last week and I explored with him an email he had sent to Mr. Barrett.  In the email he addresses his report of 2008 and says the best thing is to deal with the matter quietly.  The best thing is to keep it out of the Committee of Public Accounts and away from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I asked him if this was his preferred way of dealing with things, if it was his idea and did the idea of keeping things quiet originate with him.  I did not get an answer to that.  I think he felt very much put on the spot.  I would not be persuaded that Mr. McGee, given his level within the organisation, came up with this strategy.  He is a very competent person, I have no doubt, but he is not, in relative terms, a very senior person.  I think the evidence reflects that it was the approach taken.  <\/p><p> I will put the next question to the Commissioner because I really want to know what was happening here.  She inherited this situation.  I do not think anybody disputes that even though Ms O'Sullivan is a long-serving officer.  As Commissioner she inherited this.  What I cannot understand is the lack of decisive action on her part.  What I am trying to understand is whether she simply fell into the same mindset as her colleagues, perhaps because she has such long service, I do not know, and whether she was persuaded by colleagues to go along with this \"softly, softly, say nothing, sort it out and regularise matters\" approach.  I want Ms O'Sullivan to help me to understand that.  I just want to make clear it is the reason I raise the issue of gender.  I am very struck that Ms O'Sullivan is a trailblazer in many respects.  She is the first woman in this job, in the most senior position.  She is in charge.  If there was a dynamic around that, I would like to know whether that happened and whether it was a factor.  If it is not a factor, she should simply tell us it was not a factor and not an issue and that is fine.  Ms O'Sullivan needs to give us an explanation beyond the well-trodden ground of \"I heard about this in July and I did this\".   She has had ample questioning from colleagues which demonstrates that a letter Ms O'Sullivan wrote or signed off on to the Comptroller and Auditor General was misleading.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said he believes in his position, in the constitutional office he holds, that he did not get the full information that would have enabled him to carry out his function.  I hope I am not misrepresenting the position.  We have not had an adequate or convincing explanation from Ms O'Sullivan as the leader and person in charge as to why those things happened.  I want to give Ms O'Sullivan an opportunity to explain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#RR00400","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497945600,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>There are a lot of points in the Deputy's question so maybe I will deal with them in rotation and if I leave something out the Deputy might come back to it.  First, in Mr. Kelly's interim audit report, I am not aware of criticisms of me personally.  I am very familiar with the report.  I am quite happy to go through those if the Deputy wishes.  The point I would make on Mr. McGee's appearance here at the committee is that he appeared here as a voluntary witness to assist the committee and he, as other witnesses, is an office holder.  My understanding is he was forthright and open with the committee in respect of his interactions on the email I see here on the screen.  I cannot get into the mindset of Mr. McGee as to why he authored this email.  What I can say is the Deputy asked about decisive action.  I am very clear and I have always been very clear on my decisive action around matters such as this.  My decision is they need to be actioned.  What was very clear to me, when these matters were brought to my attention and in the days subsequent to 27 July, was that there had been, on perusal of files of my office, interactions with a number of different offices.  There had been interactions with the Department and with outside external advisers to try to fix these issues.  What I was not cited on is what had been done.  Part of the purpose of the committee we established was to gather all of that information and to compile and collate it and find out what precisely had been done.  It was very clear in the correspondence I saw at that time that the then Commissioner had issued instructions.  What I was not clear on was whether those instructions had been acted upon or not.  On the completion of Mr. Kelly's draft interim report in September 2016, it was evident that some of these actions and what had been agreed by the Commissioner, both in 2008 and 2010, were not actioned.  It was important in my mindset that we got a complete picture.  I also want to be clear - I am sure the Deputy will appreciate this - that I absolutely respect the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I absolutely respect the parliamentary position of this committee.  What I have said is we are all of the time learning lessons.  We have learned lessons from this process.  I have heard quite clearly and very carefully considered what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  At that time, my mindset was we needed to be in possession of complete information to be able to make an informed decision and to be able to fully inform everybody who needed to be informed of precisely what had been done.  We were dealing, as the Deputy said, with four-decade old structures.  Nobody knew what had been done and nobody gave us succinct answers about what had been done.  The collation exercise was to make sure we had complete information.  I respect what the Comptroller and Auditor General says, that his office would be willing to accept partial information and that is a lesson.  From here on in - and even before now - partial information will be supplied.

However, I can say that in 2015, once the matters were brought to our attention, immediate action was taken to put in place structures and mechanisms to unravel this very complicated architecture and accounting system that had grown up over four decades and to put in place the necessary structures and processes that would ensure it could never happen again.  I know the Deputy may not have been here earlier on, but I gave evidence to the committee through my colleague, Mr. Nugent, who I appointed to chair a steering group to ensure that the 19 recommendations of the interim audit report were fully implemented.  Mr. Nugent has given assurances through me to the committee.  We had an implementation deadline of June of this year.  Due to advices that we are continuing to be in receipt of and the complexities of some of the issues that we need to do, basically they will now be completed by the end of December 2017.

I do not know whether this was raised already, so I apologise if I am repeating anything, but I want to know what happened.  I will read from the second-last paragraph, which is the only issue I wish to raise: &quot;I believe that the Head of Internal Audit has acted in good faith.  Therefore I have to treat an accusation to the contrary as a very serious issue of principle.&quot;  This is the letter that we could not date, but it was just prior to his departure in April 2017.

We dealt with this matter earlier, but I welcome the opportunity to deal with it again.  I wish to emphasise to the committee that, when the document was received, I had legal advices through the CAO regarding the best mechanism to deal with this process.  That process is ongoing.  The legal advices have been received in recent days and we now have a mechanism that we are following to do exactly what it says here.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the fair procedure and due process that must be afforded to all parties involved.  There is a process that we have been advised to follow.  However, I want to make a point regarding something that Deputy McDonald raised.  Some inference may have been drawn to the effect that I was not dealing with this matter personally.  As most of those present who are executives of organisations know, there is a segregation of duties in an organisation.  Deputy McDonald asked whether there were different disciplinary processes, etc.  There are, but an important segregation of duties is also maintained.  Given that I, as Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, may have to be the arbiter or adjudicator on a matter, there must be a segregation of duties between the line managers who deal with this because the ultimate decision may be mine.  For example, it may be my decision that a matter should be referred to a different forum.<\/p> <p>  Maybe I did not explain it well earlier, but I want to be clear for the purpose of the record.  It was not me deflecting or delegating something that it was not appropriate to delegate.  It is quite the opposite.  It is appropriate, lawful and procedurally correct and proper that I would delegate that function to the line manager, where the process will take place, and the matter may end up on my desk as decision-maker regarding what needs to be done next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#XX05000","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>Do you have a final question Deputy Murphy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#YY00100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>Going back to the Cabra account, I want to clear something up for myself.

It refers to Mr. Culhane's letter about the draft report, a very serious letter.  What we as a committee were concerned about in the previous meetings was the question as to whether efforts were made by senior Garda management to in some way block what was being carried out by internal audit.  That is why we took a serious view of that letter and the whole tone of it.  Mr. Culhane did in fact withdraw parts of it here in public session at the last meeting.   We are now at the end of our public hearings and we will want to do a report in the coming weeks.  We have indicated that we want to know, and we asked Mr. Nugent the last day, what the response was to that letter.  The Commissioner says that that is still being considered and we have not got a response.  That puts us as a committee in a position that, as of now, that letter still stands as it was written as a reflection of a senior manager's view on what the internal audit was doing.  As of now, nobody has seen fit to respond to us and tell us that that is not reflective of senior Garda management.<\/p> <p>  We will need a response very promptly on the Commissioner's view on that letter.

It is a function that used to be carried out by the Minister and now the authority does it, so we have a relationship with the chair of the audit committee.  I spoke to him around June or July.  I have been trying to remember; I do not have a detailed note.  In the course of that conversation, I was satisfied that the audit committee was aware of the matter.

Mr. O'Callaghan telephoned me to tell me for the first time about this internal audit because by then the draft audit report had been circulated.  It was a courtesy call to simply let us know that it existed because he expected that it might find its way into the media and he did not want us to be surprised.<\/p> <p>  The following day the deputy commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, contacted the chief executive in similar vein.  I briefed the authority informally the following week at our monthly meeting and there it rested because we took the view that an internal audit belongs within the organisation.  It was under the auspices of the audit committee.  I got one of my colleagues in the authority to contact the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm the Comptroller and Auditor General's office knew about it.  We said the system is working; the machinery is doing what it should be doing.  We stepped back until the final audit report was published.<\/p><p>In the intervening months, to be fair to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they did offer us some briefing notes in relation to the audit, but we declined.  We took the view that we really wanted the final audit report and not to get something just from the management side.  We felt that the notes would not have been helpful to us.  That is more or less the sequence.  The final audit report was then published and immediately, or very shortly, after its publication the Minister for Justice and Equality referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and we have been doing that with regular meetings with Mr. Nugent and his team to make sure the implementation of the recommendations is proceeding.  I was keeping an eye on this discussion this morning and I was a bit disappointed to hear Mr. Nugent say that the timeline for some of the recommendations is drifting towards the end of the year.  While I understand that some of the recommendations are complex they are not all complex and so this was a bit disappointing.<\/p><p> I shall now turn to the next sequence, in the context of the Policing Authority's consideration of this matter.  We had our regular meeting in Templemore last month and we were aware that this committee was going to have a series of significant hearings.  We were aware that Mr. Kelly was doing a next phase, so we decided that the most prudent thing we could do was to continue to oversee the implementation of the previous recommendations, wait for Mr. Kelly's next instalment and wait for the work of this committee.  I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General is obviously looking at matters to do with his audit and the appropriation account.  We decided to review matters in September to see if there was any other gap that the Policing Authority should involve itself in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062000002#ZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497945600,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>At this stage, speakers have indicated in the following order: Deputies Marc MacSharry, Catherine Connolly, Alan Kelly, David Cullinane and Catherine Murphy.

Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit, stated that his work was interfered with, there was non-co-operation and that information was withheld.  In his opening statement to this committee some weeks ago he said the head of the finance directorate of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attempted to get him to change his opinion, findings and recommendations and threatened him with legal action.  Mr. Barrett, the head of human resources, spoke about a cover up.  Mr. Kelly spoke about the circling of the wagons and claimed he was duped.  We heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General that he was not informed in any year from 2006 to 2015.  Mr. Kelly sought copies of the 2008 and 2010 reports and never got them.  What is Ms Feehily's response to all that, given that her job is to implement recommendations?

It is unusual for them to be in statute.  Most Government agencies have heads of internal audit and audit committees without needing a legal framework, so there is an extra layer of protection.  There is the internal audit, with the committee to oversee it to protect the auditor from interference.  We appoint the committee.  I have met the outgoing and incoming chairpersons.  I have arranged with them that they will develop a closer relationship between that committee and the authority and will formally change the audit committee charter to formalise a closer relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na audit committee and the authority to make sure we can have a good line of sight on the work of the audit committee.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that structure is designed to protect the internal audit function from interference.  As I was following some of the proceedings of the committee today, it seems that in the end, in a letter from the outgoing chair of the audit committee, he intervened to do what the audit committee should do to protect the internal auditor.

He and his office are independent, as they must be within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because he has a specific job to do.  We also know that a report was prepared in 2015 for Mr. Dunne, who was to brief the audit committee in June or July of that year, but he did not do so until September and raised the issue under any other business.  It would seem, on the face of it, that Mr. Kelly did not get the co-operation he needed.  Maybe he was right and there was a circling of the wagons.

We are the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation but we do not just represent fishermen from Killybegs or Donegal and one of my board members, Pauric Conneely, is from the Aran Islands.  We do not just represent pelagic fishermen, covering mackerel and herring, but also have whitefish and shellfish members.<br\/><br\/>This debate is a timely one since there are a number of issues.  We were asked to address the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 and quota allocation.  At the outset, I wish to make it clear that the KFO was not consulted in advance of the publication, on 9 February, of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 and had no input whatsoever into its content.<br\/><br\/>The KFO does not support the Bill in its present form, for a number of pertinent reasons.  First, no size limit is included in the Bill.  It was our understanding that the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement had a size limitation and we would strongly advocate one if the Bill goes ahead, though we see no reason for that at this moment.  We note that a size limit has already been proposed by a number of Senators on Committee Stage and that there have been some amendments in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The second reason we are opposed to the Bill concerns the provisions relating to people resident in Northern Ireland.  The wording is &quot;sea-fishing boats owned and operated in Northern Ireland&quot; but a coach and four could be driven through this.  Multinational and other entities could claim to come under such a definition and it is contrary to what was envisaged in the 1965 <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, which clearly states that only boats owned and operated by fishermen permanently resident in the Six Counties will be permitted to fish within the new limits.  There is a huge issue with this.<br\/><br\/>Third, and most important, prior to the UK election the UK Government, through the media and supported by the UK industry, indicated that it intended to withdraw from the London convention of 1964.  This is highly likely and the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, which was under that convention, would cease to exist in such a case.  A new agreement, if so desired, would have to be negotiated with the 27 member states of the EU.  In light of this likely UK withdrawal from the London convention, the KFO considers the proposed Bill should not now proceed.<br\/><br\/>The next critical issue for us is the allocation of fish quotas, which brings me to the elephant in the room.  The mackerel review, initiated earlier this year by the Minister, Deputy Creed, is wholly unprecedented, ill-advised and bitterly divisive.<\/p><p>In a nutshell, the industry in the north west will be deprived of more than &euro;10 million of mackerel catch this year if this review goes ahead as planned.  If our current share of the quota is cut, it will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs at sea in Donegal as well as employment ashore in the highly developed pelagic industry in the wider north west.  While we accept that no decision has been reached, we in the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation believe that the course of action being adopted is fundamentally flawed and that its activation will penalise the refrigerated seawater, RSW, sector in a disproportionate and unfair manner.<\/p><p> What is more, we had a review in 2009, copper-fastened in 2010, which made changes to the sharing arrangements.  It is important to note that Deputy Creed's predecessor as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, also rejected numerous requests to take quota from the RSW sector and allocate it to the 27 polyvalent vessels with mackerel entitlements.  A letter dated 23 May 2014 from the Minister's private secretary to the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation stated that, \"The Minister considers that the percentage based allocation between the segments can properly deal with year on year fluctuations in national quota in a fair, transparent and balanced way,\" and formally rejected the organisation's lobbying to take quota from the RSW sector.  A copy of this letter is attached to my opening statement for those who wish to read it in full.<\/p><p> It is important to note that in 2014, Ireland had the highest mackerel quota in this history of the State.  We now have 18,500 tonnes less than we did then.  What circumstances have changed with this review, given such a huge reduction in the share?  In 2016, we were also hit by a 15% cut in the mackerel quota.  When there was suddenly a supposed increase in the quota last autumn, the Minister appeared open to the idea of making it available to the 27 vessels in the polyvalent sector which have a mackerel entitlement for nothing other than purely parochial reasons.  This is something we cannot and will not stand idly by and accept. We cannot countenance a situation in which the south is taking from the north west, from families who have spent generations building up businesses and borrowing to invest in their vessels, and from the many businesses which rely on this.<\/p><p> Moreover, since the public consultation exercises started last January and February, it has come to light that the scientific advice used to calculate the 2017 total allowable catch was erroneous, representing a sizeable cut of 13% in the 2016 catches rather than the 14% increase previously advised.  Aside from the obvious embarrassment caused by this mistake by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in calculating stock size, it has created huge uncertainty for our members who are trying to run businesses and provide valuable employment.  We could now be easily facing a 20% reduction next year, given that the new advice will not be fully taken into account until then.<\/p><p> Unemployment is running very high in a county like Donegal and is far above the national average.  Only last month, 765 people were on the live register in a relatively small town like Killybegs.  Our economy in Killybegs is built around fishing.  Our town, our region and our livelihoods depend on pelagic fishing.  With the banks monitoring their exposure to industries like ours, we cannot live with the risk of someone trying to undermine our bottom line. We cannot be victim to any change in the current arrangements which might jeopardise this vital industry.<\/p><p> The review also ignores the fact that the 27 polyvalent vessels which stand to benefit have already been boosted by a 750% increase in mackerel tonnage since 2000.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has gone on record numerous times stating that it has no wish to be the cause of job cuts in Donegal.  While the sentiment expressed is noble, if the ISWFPO gets its way and deprives us of 100% of the additional quota, there will be redundancies in the north west.  I should also point out that not all the 27 vessel owners agree with the ISWFPO request to take 100% of the allocation.  This was communicated by them in writing during the review process and can be read on the Department's website.  That in itself is a damning indictment of what is going on here.  Producer organisations which previously stood shoulder to shoulder and built up valuable relationships are now divided.  The industry as a whole has lost focus at a very important time as Brexit looms on the horizon.<\/p><p>The Irish RSW sector has invested heavily in specialised vessels and has played a major role in developing the mackerel fishery in this country.  Prior to the introduction of the total allowable catch, TAC, and quota systems in 1983, it established a credible track record in catching mackerel.  Without this excellent track record, Ireland&rsquo;s current 21.2% share of the western mackerel TAC would probably only be somewhere between of 1% and  2%.<\/p><p> When no one else wanted to invest in a fleet capable of fishing mackerel, not least our colleagues in the south and west, the entrepreneurial, skilled and committed fishermen of the north west did just that.  When no one was interested in fishing mackerel, KFO members identified an opportunity, rose to the challenge and developed a fishery that is now the envy of many others.  Is it in any way just that a change in quota sharing arrangements would now seek to take the metaphorical fish from our table?<\/p><p> I will give the committee the example of one our skippers.  Marc Gallagher is 38 years of age has worked on a pelagic vessel since he left school after the leaving certificate.  He has huge monthly repayments in excess of &euro;80,000 a month.  If we lose out on this, not only Mr. Gallagher's boat but many other pelagic vessels will become unviable.  We will then be left with the huge problem of losing jobs in Killybegs, both at sea and ashore. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2160,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut Mr. O'Donoghue off in mid-stream but I am conscious of time and we all have a copy of his statement.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our reasons the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 should not proceed further.  The Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO, is the longest established fish producer organisation, representing all fishing segments from large RSW, refrigerated seawater, fishing vessels to small under 10 m inshore vessels that fish for crab and lobster.<br\/><br\/>On 30 November 2016, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, indicated in a parliamentary question that he would introduce legislation in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Barlow case.  The Supreme Court found that the previous <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement had no basis in law but that the Government could put such an agreement or a similar agreement on a proper legal footing.  The Supreme Court did not direct that this should be done.<br\/><br\/>The <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement was an agreement by way of the exchange of letters between senior civil servants from Northern Ireland and Dublin.  In that correspondence between J.V. Bateman and E. O&rsquo;Sullivan in late 1965, it was agreed that vessels not exceeding 75 ft, owned and operated by persons permanently resident in Northern Ireland, could fish in accordance with a licence issued under the 1952 Fisheries Act or the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1959.  An extract from the note of 25 August 1964 from the Commonwealth relations officer stated that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government propose to leave unchanged the arrangement under which vessels from the Republic of Ireland are permitted to fish within the exclusive fishery limits of the British Islands adjoining Northern Ireland and that this arrangement would stay in place as long as the authorities of the Republic of Ireland continue to accord to Northern Irish vessels the same treatment as they accord to vessels of the Republic of Ireland in the waters around the coast of the Republic.<br\/><br\/>On 9 December 2016, I wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, expressing my grave reservations and, in particular, that such legislation may extend or increase access to Ireland&rsquo;s exclusive fisheries limits by foreign vessels beyond that agreed at the London Fisheries Convention.  I was also concerned that by making provision to allow one of the contracting parties of the London Fisheries Convention, namely, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to alter this agreement, that all other 11 countries may avail of any new agreement.<br\/><br\/>On 9 February 2017, the draft Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was published.  This raised serious concerns with my organisation and across the Irish fishing industry in general.  In the first instance, there was no stakeholder engagement on what was an attempt to allow vessels owned or operated in Northern Ireland to enter and fish between zero and six nautical miles measured from the base line.<br\/><br\/>On 2 March 2017, I took the unprecedented step of asking Dermot Conway, our solicitor, to write to M&aacute;ire Whelan, the then Attorney General, on the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017, and in particular to raise our concerns on the potential difficulties around the definitions and obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and the preferential treatment of a class of person.  That document is before the committee.  I also wrote to the committee in March of this year for the first time in six years asking that I present my concerns on this Bill to its members.  I am doing that here today.<br\/><br\/>If this Bill is passed, any vessel registered in the UK, whether owned by an individual or conglomerate from any EU member state, can avail of access inside our exclusive six-mile limit.  The Bill, as presented, is devoid of any safeguards.  There are no length or engine power restrictions.  This proposed legislation clearly exceeds the scope of what was agreed in 1965.  It was not a blank cheque in 1965 but this legislation is.  The Minister in presenting the Bill to the Seanad on 8 March 2017 indicated other measures will have to be put in place.  However, the Bill as drafted, contains none such.  The Seanad was correct to reject the Bill as it is fraught with uncertainties and lacks the preciseness required to avoid future legal challenges or abuses by those availing of it.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is an open back door for all EU operators.  Ireland fishes approximately 40% of its fisheries quota in UK waters and retaining that access will be critical.  Both the Common Fisheries Policy and the London Fisheries Convention are under threat from the UK triggering Article 50.  The UK fishing industry is lobbying for a withdrawal from the 1964 convention.  It is illogical to progress at this time with the Bill in light of the clear lack of legal certainty that now exists.  One may very well wish to promote good all-Ireland relations.  The Supreme Court, however, has clearly held that we are talking about natural resources belonging to the State.  Good relations may be a goal of the State but it ought not to be at any cost.  In the Seanad, the Minister relied on the fact Article 50 had not been triggered.  It has now.  The Minister knew in March that it was coming and argued that he could only deal what was before him.  Article 50 was triggered on 29 March 2017.<br\/><br\/>National self-interest is an important concept.  The UK is promoting its own agenda to put Britain first.  As a state, it is more than entitled to do so.  It is equally the case for Ireland.  To pass this Bill would be politically naive to say the least.  More importantly, Ireland would be giving away its poker chips before the game even commenced.  There is simply no justification for bringing this Bill forward.  The UK is leaving the Common Fisheries Policy and is likely to leave the London Fisheries Convention.  Ireland and other EU member states may be excluded from accessing much needed fishing opportunities in UK waters in just a couple of years.  This, if it happens, will have massive economic consequences for Irish coastal communities and businesses.<br\/><br\/>The outcome of the Supreme Court case is an opportunity for Ireland as vessels from Northern Ireland and the UK will require access inside our six-mile exclusive zone.  This should be part of a future negotiation strategy by the Government in terms of maintaining our access to UK waters in the future.  Any future legislation on this issue should be presented in detail to impacted stakeholders under a proper transparent public stakeholder review process.  The opposite has been done to date.  This I found to be alarming and without proper reason or justification.<br\/><br\/>One member of this committee posed a question during the Seanad debate on this Bill on 8 March.  His view was that bringing this Bill forward was a mendacious reaction to the State losing the Supreme Court case.<br\/><br\/>The demersal quota system is managed well through a committee process.  We make recommendations to the Minister on a monthly basis and quotas are allocated on the shares given under the Common Fisheries Policy.  <br\/><br\/>The sharing arrangements for pelagic stocks are managed differently.  The 23 RSW vessels, six of which are members of the IFPO, have access to pelagic stocks only.  Four of those vessels are based in Killybegs and two in Castletownbere.  We also have polyvalent vessels that fall under a mixture of pelagic and demersal quota management regimes.  Some are limited to demersal species only; others have access to demersal and pelagic stocks.  For example, 11.7% of the share out of Ireland&rsquo;s horse mackerel quota is given to six polyvalent vessels from the south exclusively.  The rest of the polyvalent fleet does not get a specific allocation.  RSW vessels have been excluded from the pelagic Celtic Sea herring fishery.  There are also RSW vessels that do not enjoy a specific entitlement in the boarfish fishery while some polyvalent vessels do.  There is much history attached to track record and ambiguity around how some of the policies were finally settled.  A large number of RSW vessels do not have access to pelagic fish when they are dedicated pelagic vessels.<br\/><br\/>At our annual general meeting last December, the IFPO took a decision not to support any change in the sharing arrangements for mackerel.  We did have a minority position in the organisation with several members wanting to see some changes allowing polyvalent members having access to mackerel.  Our position, however, is clear.  We do not support it.  There has been much trouble settling this in the past and much political capital expended on it.  The majority of the IFPO members stated there was no merit in this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2167,"content":"<p>I reiterate the fact that we, as part of the industry, were not consulted before the publication of this Bill.  It would be normal practice for that to have happened.  We represent members from County Louth, County Down, all around the south coast, up to Galway.We have a wide membership base that would be affected by the Bill.<br\/><br\/>My submission is short.  The Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation object to the introduction of the above Bill in its present form.  I do not intend to go into the legal technicalities but will rather concentrate and confine my comments to the practical fishing issues that would impact on our fishermen should the Bill be passed in to law.<br\/><br\/>We see this Bill as giving open unfettered access to Northern Ireland vessels of any size and power to fish in our 0-6 mile exclusive Zone.  This could result in extreme over fishing in this vulnerable zone, over which we currently have exclusive control.  Examples of this would be where our vessels are constrained by national measures such as quotas, restrictions on access etc., but under the proposed Bill we would have no control over Northern Ireland registered vessels in this same area.  This would allow said vessels to fish indiscriminately for non-quota species and also target quota species during periods and areas that are closed to our national vessels.  This would present a totally unfair situation. <br\/><br\/>Access would also be a problem.  We have a restriction on access in certain areas around our coast for our national vessels whereby vessels over a certain size may not fish inside our 12 mile limit.  Northern Ireland vessels would not be subject to such restrictions under the Bill.  These vessels could enter and fish in areas closed to our national fleet such as the Dunmore Box -  a very famous herring fishing box - which is closed completely to herring fishing for all Irish registered vessels of over 17 m, and which is closed for more than 40 weeks per year to all smaller vessels targeting herring.That is the sentinel fleet consisting of vessels of 8 m, 9 m, 10 m and 12 m.  This would be an outrageous situation to find ourselves in.<br\/><br\/>At present a vessel from anywhere in the UK could register in Northern Ireland at short notice thereby complying with the Bill&rsquo;s stated objective in Section 1(a).  In theory, UK  super scallopers - big, big vessels with a lot of dredges aside - could be given open access to grounds which are off limits to our own similar vessels.  I do not have to point out the resulting damage to our stocks but this will also have a major environmental impact due to the use of very heavy fishing dredges being used on delicate inshore grounds traditionally fished by our smaller vessels with static gear, for lobsters, whelks, crabs, etc.<br\/><br\/>Control would also be a problem for our control authorities.  Smaller vessels are not subject to vessel monitoring systems, VMS or to electronic reporting.  There is no facility under the Bill to make this a requirement.  As a result we would not have accurate data on quantities of fish taken out of this zone or of the number of vessels engaged in fishing there.  The same problem of policing these vessels would apply where they may enter our internal waters.  This is the zone to the landward side of our baselines, the areas into the bays.  The baselines normally go from headland to headland tor rock to rock.<br\/><br\/>The reciprocal rights issue that the Minister so eloquently promoted at every opportunity is dead in the water, as pointed out by Senator Mac Lochlainn during the Seanad debate on the matter.  These reciprocal rights would entail trading an area of 84% of an all Ireland zone for a 16% zone of indeterminate value.  While it is laudable that all fishermen from the island of Ireland could in theory fish right around the coast, and while this would be in line with the Good Friday Agreement, we seem to be intent on introducing legislation with no indication of parallel legislation being introduced by the Northern Ireland Administration.  Even if the will were there to legislate and afford us reciprocal rights I believe this could not be done in the context of Brexit.  It would not be practical to pre-empt Brexit by now introducing an open border at sea while we do not yet know the outcome of Brexit negotiations regarding an open border on land.<br\/><br\/>Fishing at sea has changed dramatically in the 50 plus years since the 1965<i>voisinage <\/i>arrangement.  All vessels - even small vessels - have multiples of the power that vessels had in those days and modern vessels can operate with much heavier and much more efficient gear, which can decimate a fishery in a very short period of time.  Giving legal status that old arrangement could never result in the outcome that was envisaged then.  As such, we cannot introduce a Bill giving free-for-all access in our 0 to 6 mile zone to what would in effect be UK fishing vessels.  It would be irresponsible and reckless in the extreme.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the issue of quota sharing.  As the two previous speakers have indicated, we have a monthly quota management advisory committee at which we allocate quotas on a monthly basis.  We advise the Department on allocations of quotas on a monthly basis, ready to keep fish at sea and hang on to it - making sure that quotas are not eaten up early in the year and that boats can stay at sea for the year.<br\/><br\/>The committee specifically wanted to address the mackerel situation.  It is our position in the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation that any review of the mackerel allocation policy should not be limited to a partial review that would limit the scope to cover any increase in 2017 over that of 2016.  To that end we wrote to the Minister.  As per our letter to the Minister on 23 December 2016, it is our stated position that any review of mackerel policy should be a wider ranging full review and our request is that in such a review 5% of the national mackerel quota should be set aside for demersal swaps.  Demersal swaps refer to whitefish swaps.  This would in some small way partially rectify the imbalance where over a number of reviews the pelagic entitlements of a large section of our polyvalent fleet was eroded and lost to those vessels.  Originally these entitlements allowed them to target pelagic species.  All our vessels would have had entitlements to fish pelagic species in previous years.<br\/><br\/>In the event that this review is limited for 2017 to the figure quoted by the Minister of 10,617 tonnes, our position is that 4,000 tonnes of that figure - which would equate to approximately 5% of the national mackerel quota for this year -  should be set aside for demersal swaps.<br\/><br\/>Should the Minister accede to the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation request by dividing the remainder of the increase between tier 1 and tier 2 equally in 2017, those vessels benefitting from this share of mackerel should surrender their whitefish entitlements for 2017.  It is a fact that some of our members who are in that sector have indicated to me that if they did not get any share from the 300 tonnes to 350 tonnes of mackerel increase, then they would not surrender their share out.  That would give lie to the figures for whitefish that would be returned to the whitefish fleet.  They have said there were other members of other organisations who would feel the same way in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugo Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#G00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2169,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for asking us here to discuss these important issues.  I would like to introduce Mr. John D. O'Suliivan, our chairman from Castletownbere, and Mr. Greg Casey, an adviser.  Mr. John Nolan and Mr. Ronan Sheehy are also in the Gallery.  Ronan Sheehy is a young fisherman with a deep and vested interest in what goes on in the fishing industry because he sees his future in it.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisations of the four producers organisations in the Republic represents the greatest number of fishing vessels in Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleet including a diverse selection of members who fish in every segment of our fishing industry.  They operate every type of fishing method, inshore and offshore, are currently concentrate primarily on Irish and UK waters.<br\/><br\/>I come from a fishing background.  My family has a proud tradition of earning our living from our coastal waters.  I am told that I come from ten generations of islanders, so we have a long tradition of trying to secure our livelihood from the sea.  I started off in a very small boat, worked in different sectors of the industry to gain knowledge and ended up diversifying into aquaculture.  I was then offered this position in the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.  I see that we have great difficulties in our industry.  I am coming to this with fresh eyes, perhaps, because what is being portrayed here today is that it is a case of one taking fish from the other and that it is one section of the country against the other section of the country.  That was never the intention of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.<br\/><br\/>We were presented with a problem in 2016.  Sections of our white fish fleet, under the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, were in a situation of imbalance.  This meant that there was not enough fish to go around.  When we were presented with the opportunity of looking at other ways of diversifying, we decided to present that to the Minister and that it would be investigated to see if there was merit in it.  We have since put forward those papers to the Minister to show that there is room to investigate this.<br\/><br\/>To fast forward, the Department forwarded us information on the different fish that have been caught by the 27 vessels in 2016.  They include cod, haddock, hake, ling, megrim, monkfish, nephrops, plaice, pollock, skates and rays, sole, whiting and saithe.  The value of the fish that has been landed by these 27 vessels adds up to &euro;9 million, which is a substantial amount.  In fact, it is 7% of the white fish quota that Ireland is allowed to catch.  That could be returned to the other vessels if, and only if, as my colleague Mr. Hugo Boyle pointed out, enough mackerel was presented and an opportunity was given to the other boats to diversify from the white fish sector into the pelagic sector, which they currently operate as well.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to make out that this is a case of us versus them, so I would like to revert back to the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill and speak about that first.  With regard to this new legislation, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation feels that what is meant by certain sections in the Bill is not clear.  We would like to table some questions to the committee to seek further clarification from the Minister and his Department.  We are cognisant that the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, has said he is only legalising a previous agreement to honour our countries commitment under the <i>voisinage <\/i>agreement.As an organisation, we feel that it is important to retain and build on the important relationships with our fellow fishermen across the Border and that the Minister's intentions in terms of this legislation are important.  To this end, we seek clarification from our Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on aspects of the legislation that concern us.<br\/><br\/>On vessels owned and operated in Northern Ireland, we want to know if anyone can register a fishing company in Northern Ireland, buy a boat there and fish in the Republic because they know how a company up there and the boat is owned and operated within the Six Counties.  There is no mention of the code of practice that our vessels must comply with.  What Government body, North or South, will regulate ownership, operation and safety concerns?  Regarding the fish that these vessels will catch, who or what will decide to place limits, if any, on the amount or the species and how this will be recorded by these vessels?  We operate a monthly quota management advisory committee based on the quota given to us for our vessels fishing in areas where they have specific rights detailed on their licences and authorisation.  This is done to ensure we remain within the amounts decided at the December Council in Brussels to ensure the stability and sustainability of the stocks.  Will the fish these vessels catch and land be included in the figures for the Republic of Ireland and deducted from Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, granted to us each December following the EU Council Meetings?  If the answer to this is &quot;Yes&quot;, will reciprocal access also include reciprocal amounts of fish?  For example, if ten tonne of hake is caught by one of these Northern Ireland vessels, will we be allowed to catch that once Brexit is formalised?  Will we be able to access that in their waters regardless of whether it is in just the Six Counties or UK waters?  These are some of the questions that concern us and our members and we advocate that they are examined closer.<br\/><br\/>I would like to address some of the issues and the elephants that were mentioned as being in the room.  It is important to note that the committee would understand that in Ireland we do not operate individual TACs and quotas.  This means that the fish that the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, fought so hard for in Brussels on behalf of Ireland is simply explained: All fish quotas allocated to Ireland belong to the Irish State and not individuals, companies or groupings.  These quotas are then allocated by the Minister of the day.  The only guidance from a legal point of view is that he or she allocates the quota &quot;for the greater good&quot;.  On that basis, we have looked at previous landings of our vessels that have both white fish entitlements and pelagic entitlements.  These boats have a clear track record.  When they get an increase in the pelagic entitlements or the fish that they are allowed to catch, they automatically reduce their effort in the demersal and the white fish fleet.  It is proven and it has been shown.  We have demonstrated here with this paper from the Department all the different amounts of fish.<br\/><br\/>It has been discussed here that every month we allocate quotas.  All the industry sits down in a room together, including the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Department with responsibility for the Marine, and look back over three years of data and the fishing records of that particular month.  We use our own knowledge within the producer organisations of our own vessels' activity to try to share out the crumbs - the fish that Ireland is given.  We have 3% of the European quota to share out while 30% of the landings of Europe come from Irish waters.  Instead of us doing battle or trying to pick holes with each other, I severely advocate that we come together and look at the bigger problem, which is that there is an imbalance in the fleet and we do not have enough quota to address it.<br\/><br\/>With the landing obligation, that will be a serious concern.  Already in certain areas that we fish in, we can no longer catch species such as haddock and cod.  We got a notification from the Department that these areas are closed.  Under the landing obligation with haddock, we really do not have any access into that ground.  We have a by-catch of 400 kg for the boat for the month to go into that area and catch other species.  The committee will see from the figures that there was 53.7 tonne of haddock, which would be returned, caught in an area.  That would keep that place open for perhaps two or three more months.  It would address the issue.  There was cod in area V of 3.7 tonnes.  Imagine there is only 16 tonnes of a quota there for the whole country for the year, so 3.7 tonnes of it is quite a significant amount to be caught by 27 vessels that would be giving it back.  In monkfish, which is a very important fishery for us, there was 445 tonnes of fish caught by these vessels.  We land 3,700 tonnes of fish.  Therefore, more than 10% of that stock would be returned to the white fish sector.  As I said, these facts and figures come from the Department.  We have the values on the side.  In the tier 1 values, they have caught &euro;3,659,990 worth of fish.  The tier 2 boats that have dual entitlement have caught &euro;5,530,030.<\/p><p>That adds up to almost &euro;9,190,000.  It is a substantial amount of fish to return to a sector that has suffered an imbalance.<\/p><p> We were told these boats had to be decommissioned in order to bring our fleet back into line, and all this after two previous decommissioning schemes.  I am very passionate about this matter because I have seen how decommissioning wiped out my own community.  As other people seated around the room can confirm, fishing boats ranging in size between 12 m and 23 m can no longer be found in Baltimore and Schull ports because they have been put out of business.  As many as 73 boats were decommissioned so &euro;48.4 million was paid to the fishermen to leave the industry, which had the knock-on effect of 700 jobs being lost.  Now we have been told that 30 more vessels ranging between 12 m and 23 m must be decommissioned.  These small boats work in the small harbours dotted around the coastline.  It is not simply an issue that affects the North or the South.  The decommissioning of such boats will have a detrimental affect that will be felt for many generations.  The measure makes no sense because it will wipe out more ports and villages around our coastline.<\/p><p> We, as an organisation, have spent a lot of time putting forward this presentation.  We did so because we were told that the refrigerated sea water, RSW, fleet would not lose any fish.  They managed not to lose jobs the previous year on the same quota.  We have only asked for the uplift to be dished out.  The same fish that the RSW had the previous year they were going to retain for the following year.  Not only that, they secured an increase in blue whiting, which meant 600 tonnes per vessel.  Whereas the RSW boats, as Mr. O'Donnell pointed out, shared it among them.  Six boats participated in that fishery the previous year at 400 tonnes per boat and this year it is ten boats at 388 tonnes per boat.  Anyone can see it is unfair when one examines the facts.  I urge the committee to look at the merits.  It is not about taking fish off one guy to give it to another.  We want a certain amount of fish given back to 1,436 vessels that are located all around the coastline.  If the Minister sees the value in that then this industry has a chance and, therefore, we might stop vessels and boats being decommissioned.  <\/p><p> There are no individual transferable quotas, ITQs, in Ireland.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, made sure that the fish that swim in our waters, the quotas and the fish that we get from Brussels belong to everybody.  It is up to the current Minister to decide how fair and how best that fish can be allocated around the coastline, not just for individuals but communities.  I refer to people whose lives depend on the industry and have children growing up in the areas.  Jobs have already been lost.  Previous decommissioning schemes have had a huge detrimental affect on communities.  If people want to look into the matter then that is where they should start. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2171,"content":"<p>I wish to correct the record.

As this is our first attendance here I feel it is a significant one.  It further underpins the role of National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, and the regional forums as credible stakeholders.  NIFF has engaged with the Minister, Deputy Creed, and his predecessor, Deputy Coveney, on several occasions.  Personally, I feel it is important that we engage with public representatives from right across the political spectrum when and wherever necessary.  Today's meeting allows us an opportunity to do so.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017, NIFF has no formal position on this difficult topic at present.  To explain why that is the case I must explain how the inshore fisheries forums operate.  On policy and legislative issues such as this the national forum takes its direction from the six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums, RIFFS.  NIFF tries to form consensus based on the views expressed by each individual regional forum.  The topic was discussed by several of the RIFFs but only one, the south-east RIFF, requested that the issue be progressed to the NIFF agenda.  In doing so serious concerns were raised regarding the issue.  These concerns were acknowledged and agreed with by all those on the NIFF.  No views to the contrary were expressed at that particular meeting.  However, for NIFF to form a solid policy position on the issue ideally we would receive some further direction from the other five RIFFs but that has yet to happen.  I can offer my own considered opinion on the subject and it is an opinion supported by my NIFF colleagues.  My following comments on the subject need to be taken in that context. <br\/><br\/>The issue is a complex one for the inshore sector and I will try to outline why.  First, there are a number of inshore vessels registered in Northern Ireland that are genuinely owned and operated by inshore fishermen in the Republic of Ireland.  The recent Supreme Court ruling had the implication that virtually overnight these vessels could no longer operate within the Republic's 12 mile limit.  These operators now find themselves in a serious predicament in that their business effectively can no longer operate.  These operators are a minority but the views of a minority need to be taken into account. <br\/><br\/>On the other side of the coin, so to speak, the majority of inshore vessels operating within the Republic's inshore waters are registered in the Republic.  Many of the operators of these vessels invested significant amounts of capital to purchase Republic of Ireland replacement capacity in order to obtain Republic of Ireland fishing licences.  The cost would have been significantly higher than that incurred by their counterparts who were able to register in Northern Ireland.  Many of the Republic of Ireland registered operators would be more empathetic than sympathetic towards the plight of their counterparts who are registered in Northern Ireland.  Many of the Republic of Ireland registered operators would feel that their Northern registered counterparts exploited a loophole of sorts.  Many of them would feel that the Supreme Court ruling effectively closed that loophole and levelled the playing field. <br\/><br\/>In a broader context, the Bill is essentially about access to resources in our inshore waters.  This is a very serious subject as  many coastal communities depend greatly on these resources for their survival.  The management of these resources is a priority of the inshore fisheries forums. <br\/><br\/>I appreciate the genuine intentions of the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, which is an arrangement dates back to the 1960s it not earlier.  I also appreciate what I feel were genuine intentions on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to introduce a Bill to give this well-meaning and long-standing arrangement standing in Irish law.  Having said that, one must understand that we live in a very different world from that of the 1960s.  We live in a world of multinational fishing companies.  They tend to be purely profit driven and exploit fishing resources when and where they can find them.  History has proven that they will do this irrespective of the impact the practice has on the coastal communities that lie in close proximity to these resources.  Technological creep now means that boats are far more efficient than ones of equivalent size 20 years ago.Large vessels can now fish right up to our shorelines and quite often, after short periods of intensive fishing, leave inshore fisheries so depleted that smaller inshore boats struggle to stay viable.<br\/><br\/>The long-standing <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement allowed these companies, when registered in Northern Ireland, access to valuable resources within our inshore waters.  The result has had severe negative implications on our mussel fishery.  We have heard reports of where the actions of these operators had a negative impact on other inshore fisheries.  One such example is the whelk fishery where spatial conflict between Northern Ireland registered mussel vessels and Republic of Ireland registered whelk vessels that operate mobile and static gear, respectively, was an issue.  I do not claim to be an expert on what happened in the mussel fishery and I will not elaborate on the issue.  However, it is fair to say that there is a significant level of discontent within our inshore sector about the issue and a fear that similar could happen in other fisheries.  This fear is compounded by the fact that most other EU member states have up to date restrictive technical and fleet management measures in place in their inshore waters.  These measures are restrictive in terms of what size and horsepower of vessels and the type and size of fishing gear they can operate in the inshore waters of that particular member state.  In comparison, we in Ireland have not reviewed our own such restrictions in many decades.  For example, the existing measures are so arcane that the legislation is written in terms of feet and inches.<br\/><br\/>There is a feeling within our inshore sector and, indeed, in NIFF that the arrangement while well-meaning and relevant in the 1960s is no longer fit for purpose and no longer has our inshore sector's best interests at heart.  There also is a feeling that the current Minister rushed into introducing this Bill, that provides for this arrangement to be recognised in Irish Law, without taking that feeling into account.  I appreciate that we may only be a small piece of a bigger picture, a picture of Anglo-Irish relations and cross-Border co-operation.  I appreciate that this may be an ever increasing important picture now with Brexit looming.  This big picture is of little consolation to those in our coastal communities who are dependent on the resources in our inshore waters.There is also a fear within NIFF that with our counterparts in the UK lobbying for as hard a Brexit as possible, including a campaign that would see the UK withdraw from the agreement of the London Fisheries Convention of 1964, that these arrangements could result in no longer being reciprocal but favourable only to the UK.<\/p><p>The fact is that recognised stakeholders raised concerns prior to the introduction of this Bill.  It may be matter of opinion whether or not these concerns were justified but it is a fact that they exist.  It is also a fact that there was no stakeholder consultation prior to the introduction of this Bill.  It may be matter of opinion whether there should have been stakeholder consultation or not.  It is my opinion that when genuine concerns are raised by recognised stakeholders there should be consultation.  Such consultation should allow the complexities of the issue to be teased out in full while addressing stakeholders' concerns. <br\/><br\/>On the issue of quota allocation within Ireland, I will break the subject into three parts.  First, on whitefish and prawns or nephrops, it is acknowledged that Ireland&rsquo;s share of EU quotas in comparison with the resource within our waters is poor.  Whitefish and prawn quotas are allocated by the Minister on a monthly basis.  The Minister bases his decisions on advice from quota management advisory committee, of which the NIFF is a member.  We would see the system as a fair one which essentially makes the best of a bad lot.  All vessels with polyvalent licences are allocated quota on a monthly bases.  Vessels over 55 ft. in length are allocated double the quota of those that are less than 55 ft.  Quota that is allocated but uncaught effectively goes back into a pot to be reallocated to all vessels again the following month.  This arrangement continues until the annual quota for a given species in a given area is exhausted or the year comes to an end.  Despite its criticisms it is a system that works well considering the constraints, the main one being that we simply do not have enough quota.  The success of this system is in no small part due to the expertise of both my colleagues in the producer organisations and that of a dedicated unit within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  <br\/><br\/>On pelagic quota we have a different system on which we would have a very different view.  Pelagic quota is allocated under specific ministerial policy.  In these policies, the vast majority of that quota is allocated to a very small number of operators.  Quota tends to be allocated on the basis of historical track record in the fishery.  We would feel that these policies are very unfavourable to the inshore fleet.  The inshore fleet represents the majority of the Irish fleet in terms of number and employment.  Vessels under 12 m in length account for approximately 82% of the fleet in number and represent approximately 53% of direct employment in the fleet.  A case example of this is north west herring.  We have not had a commercial north west herring fishery for a number of years due to the poor state of the stock.  The existing policy was set down in 2009.  The policy allocates 95% of the quota to 57 vessels that are deemed to have a track record.  That is only 57 vessels out of the Irish fleet which stands in excess of 2000 vessels.  To be considered to have a track record vessels had to have landed a certain amount of fish over a given reference period.  We have a centuries old tradition which outlines a track record in inshore herring fisheries.  In north west herring this tradition is particularly strong in Donegal but also extends as far south along the western seaboard as the fishery extends geographically, to the mouth of the river Shannon.  Despite this, only eight vessels of less than 15 m, including just four that are under 12 m are deemed to have a track record under this particular ministerial policy.  The rest of the inshore fleet is given the option to share the remaining 5% - if it is considered economically viable to do so, which in reality it is not - with any larger boats that are not deemed to have a track record either.  I appreciate that some pelagic stocks are outside the reach of inshore vessels and that they are found too far offshore to be of any practical use but that is not the case with herring.  In fact, the results of the 2016 north west herring scientific fishery demonstrate that the heaviest aggregations of herring were found very close inshore.  In fact so close in were they, and in water so shallow, that difficulties were experienced in estimating the size of these aggregations.  To put it plainly the herring were found to be most plentiful on the doorsteps and around the boots of the inshore fishermen. <br\/><br\/>Similar could be said for Celtic Sea herring in which the inshore sector fares a little better in that 11% of the quota is put aside for a dedicated inshore sentinel fishery.  It is the view of the NIFF that this percentage for the sentinel fishery needs to be increased.  The benefits of this sentinel fishery are visible in Dunmore East, County Waterford which becomes a hive of inshore activity for the duration of this valuable winter fishery.  The fishery is restricted geographically to the Dunmore box off our south-east coast and fishing vessels greater than 17 m in length are prohibited from taking part in this sentinel fishery or from fishing herring inside the Dunmore box.  Dunmore East, the main landing port for the fishery becomes hive of activity for the duration of the fishery, which is in stark contrast to many of the other small fishing communities around our coast, many of which resemble ghost towns at this time of year.  This fishery provides a lifeline to inshore vessels from all over Ireland who travel to participate in this winter fishery.  Some even travel from as far away as County Donegal, presumably because they have little or no other opportunities available to them closer to home.  The fact that these operators must travel the length of the country in small vessels in the middle of the winter is indicative of the lack of fishing opportunities available to our inshore sector in general. <br\/><br\/>I fully appreciate that our pelagic catching sector, both the RSW and polyvalent tier one and two and the related on-shore processing sector they support, are in a great part the result of the bold vision and investment of the operators involved.  I fully appreciate that Ireland would not have its current share of EU&rsquo;s pelagic quota were it not for that vision and investment.  I also fully appreciate that Ireland&rsquo;s inshore fleet could come nowhere close to catching all of Ireland's pelagic quota.  What we all need to realise, however, is that Ireland&rsquo;s quota is a public resource and not a private one.  It would be our view that some pelagic quota in general needs to be reallocated to the inshore fleet.  This could present a vital lifeline in diversification opportunities to a currently beleaguered sector of the industry.  The inshore sector has seen the opportunities available to it dwindle over the past couple of decades.  We are not looking for the sun, moon and stars here, just modest increases that could make huge differences to a large amount of vessels and the families and communities they support.  Reasonably small amounts of quota tend to go a long way when it comes to smaller inshore vessels. <br\/><br\/>Article 17 of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, states that member states are required to use:<\/p><blockquote>...transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature.  The criteria to be used may include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the impact of fishing on the environment, the history of compliance, the contribution to the local economy and historic catch levels.  Within the fishing opportunities allocated to them, Member States shall endeavour to provide incentives to fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact, such as reduced energy consumption or habitat damage. <\/blockquote><p>One does not need a degree in economics or environmental science to see that allocating some more pelagic quota to Ireland&rsquo;s small scale fleet would be in line with this article of the CFP. <br\/><br\/>Finally and specifically on the recent and pending review of mackerel quota allocation, the NIFF has made a submission on this issue as part of the public consultation process.  That submission has been published on the Department's website and is attached as appendix to this submission.  Three of the regional forums have made submissions which are similar to that of the NIFF.  The NIFF supports the proposal put forward by the Irish south and west producer organisations but we feel that the potential increase in white fish quota available - some of which may theoretically benefit the inshore sector - which the proposal promises is not sufficient to warrant that support.  To that end, our support is conditional on a modest increase in mackerel quota for the inshore sector.  Our submission has been criticised by some in the inshore sector for not being ambitious enough.  Perhaps that criticism is justified as we seem to live in a world where no one claims to have enough and everyone seems to want more that.  However, I stand over our submission.  I feel it is fair and realistic and as long as I Chair the NIFF, I will endeavour to keep our policy grounded in the principles fairness and realism. <br\/><br\/>I appreciate the importance of this specific issue to those involved, those who stand to gain or lose the most, namely the RSW fleet segment, the polyvalent fleet segment that have pelagic entitlements and the elements of the processing industry that depend highly on them.  However, in the bigger scheme of things I feel this specific issue has become overly high profile and is distracting from the bigger picture that concerns the wider Irish seafood industry.  As a colleague of mine aptly put it, &ldquo;the issue has become a distractive squabble between the two millionaire&rsquo;s clubs of Irish fishing - the club of 22 and the club of 27 - with little or no consideration being given to the club of 2000 plus&rdquo;. <br\/><br\/>If I could deliver any message to this committee today it would be to implore its members, when giving consideration to any fisheries matters, to always give consideration to the club of 2000 plus.  That concludes my presentation and again I thank the committee for the opportunity to deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2175,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Crowley.

On the 75 ft. issue, my understanding is that when that was put to the Minister, his response was that there was no 75 ft. restriction in the previous <i>voisinage<\/i>.<\/p><p>I would ask them to come back on that and on where that 75 ft. restriction comes from, and in the event that it was and this proposal the Minister came forward with restricted it to within 75 ft., whether that would change their view on it.<br\/><br\/>The part of the country I come from is probably where there is a number of fishermen most affected by the implication of the Supreme Court decision where a number of people would be operating with Northern Irish licences and as a result, have been inhibited from fishing.  I might address this matter in relation to inshore fishermen to Mr. Crowley.  Certainly the thrust of his presentation is that there is in some way not a lot of sympathy for those who operate off Northern Irish or UK-based licences.  I ask Mr. Crowley to elaborate on the position of those fishermen if the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement is not reinstated.  Overall, what is their understanding of the position in the event of the UK withdrawing entirely from the London fisheries agreement?  Am I right in saying that would mean that any agreement that we would reinstate with them now would fall in that situation or would that potentially continue?  I suppose my overall question there is the point that many are putting with regard to the scope of the Minister's proposal and the dangers involved in that in relation to vessels coming in, and their experience of how the scope of that tallies with the experience so far.  There were particular issues on the impact on the mussel sector which led to this particular case and any comments on that as well would be welcome.<br\/><br\/>To move on to the issue of the mackerel quota, I understand the case being made by those in the whitefish fleet sector.  Having said that, there is tradition here and the mackerel quota has been built up as a result of people having invested in and put hard work into this.  Certainly, from the point of view of my own county of Donegal, the importance of the employment there to the county cannot be understated either.  For those who are pushing this particular proposal, I would like them to comment further on how that would impact on the investors and the employment there because of the structure that is in place.  I could not emphasise more the importance of that to my own county.<br\/><br\/>On the 27 vessels that are being mentioned in the context of the reallocating of the quota, I note the proposal to reallocate that whitefish to other smaller vessels.  What is the commitment regarding those and can the witnesses elaborate on the disagreement among those 27 boats as to the proposals that Mr. Crowley is putting forward and their rationale for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#K00200","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2178,"content":"<p>It was useful, to say the least, to have all the various organisations here today and to have all the perspectives put in front of us.  I will start with <i>voisinage<\/i>and the Bill that the Minister has introduced.<\/p><p>It is alarming that there is a piece of legislation introduced by the Minister on the back of a Supreme Court decision and every single organisation here today has said that it was not consulted on it.  That has profound implications for sectors of the fishing communities around the coast.  Even if one looks at the questions from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, that list of questions is entirely pertinent.  Why did nobody in the Department of the Agriculture, Food and the Marine think about those questions before the Minister introduced the legislation?  I am genuinely stunned the more I learn about the implications of how this has been implemented over the years and that is why the question from Deputy McConalogue is an important one.  Obviously, they have come here today and made a submission based on their experience of how this has operated.  I am conscious that a number of families and businesses were forced to go to the Supreme Court.  That is the only reason this is now being reviewed.  I want to get their perspective because this is an opportunity for a frank exchange here today.  What is their perspective on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that introduced this legislation?  Is this a unique scenario or is this now a cultural issue with the Department?  Are they drafting legislation that is in the interests of fishing communities across the State?<\/p><p>I was alarmed when this came before the Seanad, the more I learned about it.  I am shocked today at what every fishing organisation that has presented here  has said and what its thoughts are about this Bill.  What was said to us in the Seanad was that we needed to reinstate good faith before the Brexit negotiations took place and almost in tandem with that we had an announcement from the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, that the UK was pulling out of the London fisheries convention.  What the hell is going on that we have the top people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so completely out of touch with our own fishing community and with our fishing organisations?  It is humiliating that there was legislation that we are discussing here today put before the Seanad that will have such a detrimental impact and that these organisations were not consulted.<\/p><p>I accept it is an extremely loaded question, but how can I avoid it based on the evidence given to this committee today?  I would like to get the thoughts of everyone present on the state of affairs and what sort of job the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing on behalf of our people.  It has serious implications, based on today's meeting.  In terms of the quota issues, my colleague, Deputy Martin Ferris, will deal with them and put questions to the organisations.  However, it is clear what the organisations think of the Bill.  All of them think the Bill should be put aside at this time.  How did we get to this situation?  How did we get to a situation where there is legislation that is so poorly drafted with such serious implications?  Am I too judgmental or correct in my assessment of their evidence today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#L00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2179,"content":"<p>Who wants to respond first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#L00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2180,"content":"<p>I suppose I will start with Deputy McConalogue's questions.

The 75 ft. rule was in place, but that was dispensed with at some point along the line by the Department.  In the original agreement, which is now found to be unlawful, there were parameters.  Those parameters were dispensed with.  The 75 ft. rule was the first one, but was only for fishing vessels and aquaculture vessels.  Large dredgers were then allowed in under the so-called &quot;<i>voisinage<\/i>&quot; agreement.  That was really an abuse.  It was an agreement.  I suppose the Department thought that it had a legal standing and they dispensed with that as it suited themselves.  That would be the first two issues.<br\/><br\/>It is being abused at present.  It was initially only supposed to be for those permanently resident in Northern Ireland.  There are persons permanently resident in Galway, in Cork and in Kerry who were fishing under this agreement which now has fallen, and to be honest, they had an easier system of getting their vessels licensed.  They would not have to pay the same amount for kilowatts and tonnage and they had put themselves at an advantage.  It was a loophole within the system.

It is a new Bill.  It is very wide-ranging.  Owned and operated in Northern Ireland means that anyone in the EU with a vessel or number of vessels, a conglomerate, could technically set up a company in Northern Ireland and have full access to our six-mile limit.  One must remember that our own pelagic vessels are excluded, they have to stay out at 12 miles.  There are vessels in the north west, for example, that fish under the cod recovery system.  They have a track record between 2005 and 2008, and only they can fish when they leave the pier at Greencastle, for example.  This Bill, as currently drafted, would allow vessels from Northern Ireland that do not have that track record to fish in the Irish Sea and in area 6A, putting most of our fleet at a disadvantage.  We are talking about Brexit here.  Brexit is under way.  We need access to UK waters, at least 40% of our quota is fished there.  That is a lot of our quota.  We cannot start giving away our poker chips in advance, we need something to negotiate with.  That is an important area of water.  There are some vessels from Northern Ireland that want to fish prawns in Dundalk Bay, for example.  They will want that.  I do not mind if Ireland gives it to them two years out from now, with consultation and with proper strategic thinking around why we are doing it.  We need to get something for this.  We are either talking about stakeholders and the national interest or about political interest.  I am only interested in the former.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn's was a loaded question and a difficult one.  This meeting is publicly broadcast.  Going back a couple of years, we had a penalty points system for fishing vessels as part of EU legislation, a control regulation.  Technically it was something similar to the penalty points system for driving offences.  It was very pernicious in that one was awarded the points before going to court.  The way the legislation was drafted, one still retained the points even if one was exonerated by one's peers in court.  That was bad enough but after the structural instrument was struck down and they came up with another structural instrument which was more or less the same thing again.  They did not learn from what happened the first time.  As an industry, myself and my colleagues were psychologically very deflated that our own State would impose such legislation on us.  They had to have a penalty points system and I would accept that if it was after one had been tried and convicted.  Penalty points are coming back on the agenda.  I have heard whispers that there will be a political engagement process.  What is happening around this Bill has probably run a flag up a pole in this regard and the Department and maybe a Minister or two are thinking that they need to engage.  I would not go so far as to say that everything is deliberate but there has been a lack of engagement with us.  It might be a recommendation from this committee that when a Bill is being drafted, while the Attorney General is involved as is the Department and they have a drafting committee, it would be an idea if at least somebody from the industry with expertise could go on to that committee to say when things do not make sense or will not work.  There are probably a lot more experts on the outside that have to deal with the issues than there are on the inside creating them for us.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2182,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#M00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2183,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy McConalogue on the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, the easiest way to put this in context is to look to the people behind the Deputy in the Public Gallery who brought this case to the High Court.  I myself am involved in the aquaculture business, in mussels, but we do not dredge our seed, we collect them naturally with spat collectors.  If we collect the seed outside in the bay, we can bring it back in to another part of the bay where it is licensed and one can continue to grow the seed.  We pay for the rights of that area of water whereas with the wild seed, it is on the bottom and people can go in and dredge it.  They then take that seed into an inner bay and relay it and when it gets bigger, to marketable size, they come back and harvest it.  What was happening was that foreign boats, under a foreign flag, were coming in and taking the seed.  The amounts they took were deemed to be enough so that when the Irish vessels came in, there was no seed for them.  It basically put them out of business.  In reciprocal rights, this seed was then taken to another jurisdiction and was put down in an area of the sea bed, but suddenly it was no longer reciprocal so the Irish boats could not go back up at a later date when the seed was big enough and, like their counterparts, take the seed, harvest it and take it to market.  I hope that explains the context of how this started.<br\/><br\/>If we fast forward to today, huge changes are coming down the line due to Brexit, and the UK wants to pull out of the London convention of 1994 where all these agreements were made because it wants to take back ownership of its fishing water and the UK will take control of the access.  The UK has also flagged that it will increase the amount of fish that it will catch in its own waters.  That will change the balance of fish caught across the European Union.  At the moment, UK vessels catch 548,000 tonnes per annum, of which 350,000 is caught within its own waters and around 200,000 is caught outside its waters, whereas Ireland catches only 200,000 tonnes, of which nearly 50% is caught in UK waters.  I was given one estimate that 70% of the fish caught by UK vessels outside of its own waters are caught in Irish waters, so that would be around 140,000 tonnes versus our 100,000 tonnes.  If we had a reciprocal arrangements on that quota, not having to deal through the EU, we would have no problem.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  We do not negotiate, Europe negotiates on our behalf.  After Brexit and after the London convention has been torn up and scrapped, when these boats would be allowed to come in to the zero to six mile zone, the UK would not be obliged to pay it back for any fish they catch as it is no longer the European quota.  Who pays it back then?  Does Ireland have to take that off its own allocation from the December Council?  <br\/><br\/>It has been pointed out earlier, we do not fish in the UK waters so they have a huge advantage coming down.  We should be cognisant of the vessels that have been operating around the shoreline, and I have sympathy for these vessels.  They are caught in a situation that was deemed legal by the Department until very recently when it was found that there was no legal basis for this arrangement.  We asked another question of the Department, namely when we bring in this legislation, we assume that there has not been the same implementation of legislation to allow us to go back up there, that their arrangement was never legal either.  We asked how we will decide which vessels will be allowed access into our waters and we were told that it would be decided on the size of the vessels that we ourselves deemed would be allowed to fish within our waters.  That is the way that we would control the foreign boats coming in.  For instance, if we said that only 15 m boats and under would fish in the six mile zone, then that would then apply to Northern Ireland.  To turn that on its head, we do not know what size they will set for their shoreline.  They could decide it was 5 m for their vessels and then only 5 m vessels and under for Irish vessels could go back up there.  This arrangement needs to be discussed.  As evident from the discussion here today, no one consulted with the industry to highlight these issues.  The Deputy is asking why no one in the Department asked us.  That is something that he will have to ask them.  We would have considerable reservations ourselves about why that has not happened.  It was not the case that the topic was not raised.  It has been raised several times.  <br\/><br\/>On the mackerel, the Deputy asked what it would mean for boats that had invested.  I thought that question might come up so I brought some pictures.<\/p><p>I brought some pictures not of RSW vessels but of polyvalent vessels in the pelagic sector.  It is hard to tell them apart.  The same investment made by the RSW fleet has also been made by these vessels.  RSW is a means of improving the quality of fish; it is not a means of catching them.  I spoke to a fish buyer who used to bring mackerel to the Russian ships off the south-west coast about the history of who built up the quotas.  Everybody built them up.  Later, it was discovered that larger vessels had to compete with the international fleet and, therefore, had to invest.  When at that stage, there was nobody else to come in, the RSW vessels knew that if they were to compete, even with only 13% of the fishery versus 87%, they would have to take that risk.  They decommissioned two or three boats for themselves.  The diagram outlines the earnings for ten years by the two fleet segments.  A total of &euro;670 million was earned over the past ten years by the RSW segment versus &euro;97 million by the mackerel fishery.  That is a ratio of 7:1.  We were asked about the differences in the 27 vessels and why there is disagreement among them.  One would have to investigate who owns the 27 vessels.  Are any of the 27 owned by the owners of the 23?  Do they own both vessels?<\/p><p> I have 16 signed declarations and two submissions in our office that state if they get enough fish, they will give up their entitlements.  Mr. Boyle set the figure at 350 tonnes, which means that 20 by 350 is 7,000 tonnes.  The increase is 14,000 tonnes and the members can do the maths to see if it is possible.  We did not want to set out what should be done; we only wanted this to be investigated.  Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the Department.  We visited the Department on 4 October with our colleagues.  We presented officials with a proposal.  We did not give facts and figures but we requested that this be investigated to see if it is possible.  That is all we asked for.  When we did not secure the investigation we sought, we had to conduct the investigation ourselves and these are the figures that resulted.  With regard to the blue whiting species, there is 9% for the polyvalent sector and 91% for the 23.  In that section this year, only ten polyvalent vessels can fish whereas they can all fish for blue whiting.  There is a difference in the sharing of the mackerel within the RSW sector with different ratios applying.  Some boats get double others and they manage to operate on a year-to-year basis.  There is more to this tale than what has been outlined at this hearing but it is not for me to pick one section of our fishing industry and pit it against the other.  That was never the intention.  It was about stopping our white fish fleet between 12 m and 24 m being decimated again.  We put forward these proposals to our colleagues in the industry.  I explained the figures to them and, thankfully, the NIFF looked at it.  It has its own way of looking at it and perhaps the fish should be distributed in a fairer way, but account has to be taken of which vessels can access the fishery as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2185,"content":"<p>I will address the <i>voisinage<\/i>question first raised by both Deputy McConalogue and Senator Mac Lochlainn.  The key issue now is that legally the UK will more than likely withdraw from the London convention because if it withdraws, it will take full control of its zone between area 6 and area 12.  If the UK leaves the Union but not the convention, it will be unable to stop the access available at the moment.  Our clear understanding is that the neighbourhood agreements are included as part of the convention.  Even if a new Bill is agreed and passes through the Oireachtas, it will be defunct once the UK leaves the convention.  There will be a two-year period for this to happen.  Why is the Government introducing something new that will have to be renegotiated?  However, because we are still a member of the EU, the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement cannot be negotiated as a bilateral with the UK.  It would have to be negotiated with the EU27 and that is the telling point about this issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about the Department.  I do not know why it did not consult people but I presume the Attorney General advised on the wording of the legislation.  I have a huge problem with the wording because it does not reflect what was in the original <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, which was found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court because it had not gone through the Oireachtas.  I can only respond to the Senator's question by saying they surely got legal advice.  They should have consulted the industry on this.  This will all become irrelevant if the UK pulls out of the London convention.  If it does so, why are we bothering to do something that will be defunct in two years anyway?<br\/><br\/>On the entitlements issue, fact needs to be separated from fiction.  Our track record on mackerel was built up in the 1970s.  We had a huge &quot;Klondyke-ing&quot; fleet in Ireland from the beginning to the middle of the 1980s but the RSW fleet built up our track record in this regard in the 1970s.  There seems to be much confusion about the transfer of the 14% quota from the RSW sector to the 27 polyvalent vessels.  There is no discussion about the other 1,400 vessels.  The fact that they gave up quota entitlements can be checked at any quota management meeting.  The way we operate our white fish quota management system is we sit down on a monthly basis and we allocate fish to vessels under and over 55 ft..  For example, last year we caught 3,500 tonnes of hake.  We sat down every month and we issued approximately 16 tonnes for the over 55 ft. vessels and 8 tonnes for the under 55 ft. vessels.  We halved that as the season went on.  If the other 1,400 vessels caught the average quota of 5 tonnes per month, they would catch almost twice the quota in one month alone.<\/p><p>In our system, the fact that 27 vessels give up something will mean nothing to the others.  We also need to be clear that, on the blue whiting, the polyvalent vessels had no track record whatsoever for this and still got 9% of it.  Similarly, with the horse mackerel, they ended up with 11.3%.  We have a situation where the polyvalent sector has gained almost 13,500 tonnes of pelagic fish from 2000 to 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2187,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy McConalogue's question, since I think it was directed to me.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the implications for fishermen from the Republic of Ireland engaged in inshore fishing near Northern Ireland have been very severe, and they have basically been stopped from fishing.  I have talked to my colleagues from right around the coast about this.  I have been told about young men with families who have been told they cannot go fishing any more.  That is serious and I do not think any genuine operator within the inshore sector, whether registered in the North or South, wants to see that happen to anybody.<\/p> <p>  On the lack of sympathy, to put it in real terms, in the north of the country, there could be a situation where there could be two inshore fishermen fishing from the same pier.  They might be good friends and both may have paid for the right to go fishing and the right for replacement capacity to get a licence.  One has probably paid a multiple of what the other paid, because the person who registered in Northern Ireland had a different price.  That leads to resentment.  It is a trait of human nature, and maybe it is not one of the prettiest traits we have.<\/p> <p>  It comes down to the lack of consultation.

There are a number of reasons for that.  As Mr. Crowley pointed out, it is a different world now.  Vessels under 75 ft. in 1965 would probably have the same horsepower.  Our vessels of 12 m now would have more horsepower than the vessels of 75 ft. in 1965.  They are towing much heavier gear and have increased environmental impact on the grounds, and there is the issue of getting room on the grounds.<br\/><br\/>The other issue is control.  How would we control the vessels that would come in?  We have no vessel monitoring system, VMS, or reporting in.  On a national basis, as far as we are concerned, our vessels - we are mostly talking about small vessels here - are under control.  They have quotas that we cannot apply to vessels from outside the Twenty-six Counties.  That is unfortunate, because I do not see why any fisherman from anywhere in Ireland should be excluded from any of the waters around Ireland, but that is just life as it is at the moment.  The old agreement has gone out the window, as far as I am concerned.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is open-ended.  I think Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue pointed that out earlier.  He said one could drive a coach and horses through it.  I do not know how it was drafted and I am not going to blame anyone for drafting it, but as a layperson, and without the help of our legal colleagues here, one can see that one could almost do what he or she wanted with it.  In the old arrangement, as Mr. Patrick Murphy alluded to, on the matter of mussels, the agreement was never fully applied to many vessels.  One is talking about the zero to six mile limit.  That does not cover all the water from the shore out or all the water in the bays.  There is a baseline, and the baseline is normally run from headland to headland.  It can run from island to island.  We have internal waters inside that baseline, as per section 86 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Inside those baselines, those vessels were not entitled to ever go in.  They were only entitled to enter in the zero to six mile limit.  We are introducing that again in this Bill.  There is a vague area there.<br\/><br\/>On Senator Mac Lochlainn's question, as he said, all the organisations here at the moment were opposed to the <i>voisinage<\/i>, and he asked why nobody in the Department took cognisance of that.  We were never consulted.  In all developments, as far as the fishing industry is concerned, the Department is beholden to consult the industry.  It seemed to railroad that particular Bill through.

The two issues we are discussing here would probably both justify a meeting to discuss each equally.  There are many implications in them.<\/p><p>On the <i>voisinage <\/i>agreement, I think the situation that has arisen through the Supreme Court case - in that the Department has never regulated properly for inshore fisheries at any stage over the past 50 years, which has led to a situation where people have had to go to court to get their rights vindicated - is a signal of how the Department has traditionally dealt with fisheries and fishermen right across the board.  Everybody here representing the organisations could point to situations where a proper intervention and intervention in a regulated manner would have dealt with many problems.  Mr. Francis O'Donnell outlined the situation with the penalty points earlier.  If that had been handled properly in the first place, we would never have had a situation where fishermen had to go to the High Court and the Supreme Court to get justice from our own Department.<\/p><p>It has led to the problem where some inshore fishermen, as a result of the cost of entry into fishing in this State, with the Department having manufactured a market for kilowatts and tonnage, go to the Six Counties and get a licence there where it is much cheaper and the barriers to entry are not the same.  Then, due to the lack of regulations, they are able to come to live and work here and fish with their vessels.  That is the mess that has been created by the Government not looking at the <i>voisinage <\/i>agreement that was implemented in 1965, regulating it and having a proper system of regulation.  It makes one wonder why the Government ever governs at all, when these situations are allowed to happen.<\/p><p>I agree with what the witness from the IFPO said.  Perhaps something could be done - a trade-off, for example - regarding the <i>voisinage <\/i>arrangements as part of a future negotiation, but if the UK leaves, we will not be able to make a bilateral agreement with it.  The EU 27 would have to do it, which means that it probably will not happen.  Mr. Conway, the solicitor, might be able to answer my next question, but it is open to all of the organisations.  If the Minister insists on proceeding with this legislation, would an amendment be possible whereby, if the UK withdraws from the London agreement, the legislation will fall or the system under it will cease to be?<br\/><br\/>Some of my questions have already been answered, so I am going through my list to see what has been missed.  My point is about agreeing <i>voisinage<\/i>.  If the UK withdraws from the London agreement, it will make continuing with the legislation a waste of time and we should not be pursuing it.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Murphy of the ISWFPO stated that the mackerel share-out was pitched as being for the uplift that took place in 2016.  Given the fact that the uplift was not an actual uplift and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, has stated that it got its figures wrong, in that it made a mistake in calculating for an increase in the mackerel quota and that this will more than likely be clawed back next year with a 20% to 25% decrease, does it not remove the rationale for seeking the share-out in the first place?  Is the real intention for requesting a review to change the ratio in the share-out?  The &euro;9.6 million in whitefish that it is claimed polyvalent vessels will forgo is almost equivalent to the value of mackerel that will be gained.  Is this being done purely on the basis of looking after the vessels that only fish for whitefish?<br\/><br\/>Regarding the potential impact of the review on Killybegs, everyone working there depends on the fish factory for a livelihood.  Any reduction would not only have an impact on fishermen, but on people's ability to live and work locally.  This should be given significant consideration in the review.<br\/><br\/>It was mentioned that the refrigerated sea water, RSW, sector lands better quality fish.  Surely that means better quality for the whole fleet and a higher value for the export market and it should be maintained.  There has been a significant emphasis on improving quality in recent years so as to maximise markets, including export markets.<br\/><br\/>I have a question for the NIFF.  Mr. Crowley mentioned that it could not take a view on the Bill because of the structure of the original forum.  I read in one of the fisheries newspapers in recent weeks that an inshore fishermen's organisation was being set up because the NIFF could not take a view as a result of being a part of the Government, in that it is a part of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  Does the fact that this is departmental policy have an impact on whether the NIFF takes, for example, a contrary view on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#O00600","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2193,"content":"<p>I thank the groups for attending and giving expansive and comprehensive presentations.  Being from the midlands, which are inland, this has been educational.  My first exposure to this matter was the discussion on the Supreme Court case with Mr. Kelly, his colleagues and their legal adviser.  It was instructive.  I have been against the Bill from early on for a number of reasons, but it would be prudent and wise for the Minister now to withdraw it and go back to the drawing board.  It is legally infirm on its face, not least because of its level of uncertainty.  It is vague and, as a barrister, I can see a large number of issues.  This is even without turning to the UK's membership of the London convention.<\/p> <p>  The reason that the Minister gave for introducing the Bill with considerable speed was to show goodwill to our neighbours in the Brexit negotiations.  Contemporaneously, the UK indicated that it would withdraw from the 1964 London Fisheries Convention.  The reciprocal arrangements would fall, as would the whole edifice, and the UK would resume full control.  From that perspective, the Minister's likely suggestion will be that he can remedy some of the issues that have been raised about the restrictive parameters by way of secondary legislation, such as statutory instruments, but the Bill is so defective that doing so would be farcical, given that the statutory instruments would be larger than the Bill itself.  Normally, primary legislation should be clear in its objectives, but there is ambiguity in this regard.  Prevailing would be difficult were the legislation attacked on these grounds.  Perhaps the Minister should take the prudent course as regards these issues.  As some of the witnesses have stated, the legislation may not be required in a couple of years' time anyway.<\/p> <p>  I listened with interest to the organisations' pitch.  It is all about quotas, of course.  I come from an area where, years ago, sheep and milk quotas were the real beef, as they say.  All of my colleagues present are from along the coast and know far more about fisheries than I do.  I was jotting down points and may well have them wrong, so forgive me if they are.  I expect the witnesses to correct me.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that there were no ITQs in Ireland.  That is national policy.  My colleague, Deputy Gallagher, would have been involved in that.  ITQs have never been in place.  There was an opportunity to change the policy in 2013, but it was not taken by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney.  This distinguishes us from other member states where ITQs prevail.  I undertook some legal research on this matter as best I could, although I could have misinterpreted the situation because I am not familiar with the fisheries industry.  I am surprised that there are so many diverse views.  In a natural resource industry that was argued for trenchantly in the Supreme Court by Mr. Kelly and his colleagues, it is important that some degree of uniformity of approach be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Surely the argument being made is that the 11,000 additional tonnes in mackerel that will become available from the EU for distribution are the subject of the review.  Am I correct in saying that 87% has been allocated to 23 boats and 13% has been allocated to 27 boats?  Maybe I am wrong.  Surely the issue of the 11,000 tonnes could be examined in that regard.  If the Minister will be in control of the quotas, surely he or she will be able to make a decision in that regard.  It was made in 2003 in terms of albacore tuna.  That quota was built up and distributed across a large number of boats.  Perhaps I misread the information and there are no parallels, but it strikes me as having some significance.  There must be an opportunity to take quota in the fishing industry, thereby spreading the objectives.<\/p><p>Surely a solution can be found that recognises the significant investment made by many of those who depend on fishing to pay their bills, while also achieving some uptake for those at the bottom of the food chain.  Is this not what we seek to achieve by allocating quotas in other areas?  As I have always argued for this approach, I do not propose to be two-faced and hypocritical in this regard.  Having seen small farmers crushed and larger farmers do very well, I must take a consistent line in the area of fishing.  Nevertheless, I also recognise special factors such as the investment made by individuals who should not be denied the opportunity of making repayments in difficult circumstances.  I hope all parties' objectives can be met in a reasonable manner that ensures this important natural resource, which provides significant employment in coastal towns and counties, will continue to progress.  I genuinely hope this outcome can be achieved.<\/p><p> While I may well have misconstrued some of the comments made, I was struck by the points made by Mr. Crowley of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum.  I may have gravitated towards his contribution as I am from an inland area but it was clear and cogent and struck a chord with me.  Moreover, it was instructive and illuminating that it seemed to steer a middle course.  <\/p><p> I thank all the parties for their comprehensive presentations.  This has been a worthwhile exercise.  As Deputy Pringle stated, a meeting with each of the organisations represented would have been warranted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#P00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2195,"content":"<p>May I contribute now as I have to chair the D&aacute;il at 7 p.m.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#Q00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2196,"content":"<p>With respect, the Deputy knows the rules.

I was chairing the D&aacute;il earlier and I must resume the Chair shortly.  However, I speed read their presentations.<\/p><p>On the <i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements, at the time the legislation was published, I presumed its purpose was to provide a legal basis for the Lemass-O'Neill agreement reached in the 1960s.  Having listened to members and the debate in the Seanad, it is clear that serious concerns arise in this regard.  Mr. Boyle stated we should introduce some mechanism to deal with the old arrangement with which he does not agree.  I anticipate that something could be introduced to provide a legal basis for what was in place previously.<\/p><p>We could easily decide to withdraw from the London convention when Brexit takes place in two or three years.  In the meantime, genuine fishermen have had to tie up their boats.  Let me be selfish on this issue, the people I represent in Donegal have small vessels of less than 50 ft. in length.  These vessels did not decimate the fisheries off our coast.  It was for this reason that I suggested the measures apply to vessels of 15 m or less.  The Minister must do something in the interim period because these boats are tied up and some of the fishermen have lost their jobs.  Some form of compensation should be paid to them or we should find a way to cater for small vessels.  We should introduce a legal basis for the old arrangement.  It is too simplistic to suggest pulling out of the London convention and then negotiating with the 27 member states. <\/p><p>On the allocation of mackerel quotas, as a Minister of State in the Department for a number of years, I had delegated responsibilities for marine.  I believe this allocation contravenes the explicit commitment given in a ministerial policy decision taken in 2009, which was reviewed and confirmed and 2010.  Many times over the years, the industry and others, including me, argued that the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, is not always correct.  This year, it admitted that instead of giving an increase of 14%, the allocation would decrease of 9%.  This was in place and the quotas were divvied out.  Next year, we will have a double whammy when the mackerel quota is significantly reduced.  We hoped the reduction of the 14% would have been implemented this year but it must be done on a Europe-wide basis.  The inaccuracy of ICES is disgraceful and despicable. <\/p><p>The 15% reduction in the refrigerated seawater or RSW fleet last year was not raised.  Was there a outcry last year arguing that others should suffer as a result of that reduction?  I passionately believe that the reason we have a quota of 21.2% of the western tack is the historical performance of the RSW fleet.  Now, however, some would like to piggy-back on that.  While I am aware that RSW vessels are not equipped to fish for whitefish, if they were able to adapt to fish for whitefish, it would not be acceptable to those involved in the polyvalent and demersal sectors.  Following his request for submissions, I made a submission to the Minister pointing out that the polyvalent-pelagic fleet had secured an increase of 750% in mackerel quota since 2000.  Politicians like to be all things to all people but we must also be honest with ourselves and realistic.  I make no apologies for calling on the Minister in the D&aacute;il, following the <i>faux pas <\/i>by ICES, to shelve it but it will go on and on.  We must be pragmatic, which means the decision will have to be taken sooner rather than later.<\/p><p>I do not have to tell anyone in the polyvalent or RSW sector that fishermen make substantial investments in their boats.  I shudder to think what would happen if the waters off the north west coast of Scotland were to be shut off to Irish vessels.  Irish fishermen would still catch fish in the Irish Sea but they would catch poorer quality fish at the end of the season when prices are at their lowest.  <\/p><p>I do not want to take advantage of the Chairman's generosity but I wanted to make those points rather than ask questions.  I hope we can sort out the <i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements and the small fishermen who are affected.  Some degree of realism is also needed in the debate on mackerel quotas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#Q00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2200,"content":"<p>I have been fishing for 47 years and have been pelagic fishing for most of my life.  Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue is wrong to state that RSW 23 seemed to take over all the quotas.  The RSW 23 vessels that emerged in 1995 evolved out of the pelagic sector but they were not the only boats pelagic fishing in the polyvalent sector.  Between 30 and 60 other boats were pelagic fishing in the polyvalent sector.  A rule was then introduced under which polyvalent vessels could not chill fish in tanks.  Similar rules applied to farmers, with one farmer allowed to chill milk in a tank, while another farmer bringing his milk to the creamery could not chill his milk.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, it is completely wrong to claim that track record creates quotas.  Fishermen go out to catch fish and we will catch any fish.  In the 1990s, for example, we fished for tuna.  We make a living out of fishing and it is wrong that we do not get a fair share of the quota afterwards.  The tuna quota allocated to 17 or 18 polyvalent vessels - I believe there were 26 vessels in that fishery in the period from 1988 to 2002 when drift netting was stopped - has built up to 2,600 tonnes.<\/p><p>However, in 2001, the then Minister of State at the Deputy of the Marine and Natural Resources, Mr. Hugh Byrne, said:<\/p><blockquote>Since the drift net ban and a four year phase out period were agreed by the Council in 1998, 18 vessels owned by 14 fishermen were licensed to fish by drift net.  They caught more tuna in each year of the phase out period than in any year prior to the agreement.  These owners are beneficiaries of the 18 licences granted to prosecute the annual &pound;7 million fishery.  The increased numbers of licences for other fishing methods will mean that 50 vessels will participate in future fishing.<\/blockquote><p>The then Minister of State increased the number of licences from 18 to 50.  He said that &quot;the benefits of this lucrative fishery will be spread more widely throughout the fishing community&quot; but he did not take into account the track record of the men who put the tuna quota in place.  We were cast aside.<br\/><br\/>I do not know what they are saying about scad.  Every polyvalent boat was entitled to catch scad, horse mackerel and blue whiting up to 2007 or 2008 when the policies came in.  It was a case of here we go again.  The cards were dealt and RSW got 91%, 97% and 95%.  That is what happened.  We were treated like second-class citizens.  Speakers have mentioned investment.  I invested &euro;7 million in a vessel in 2004 but the vessel in Castletownbere was tied to the pier for four months and my partner vessel was tied up for six months because they did not want us to put fish into tanks.  It was anti-competitive.  There was a policy to stop us going ahead.  There was a policy that we would have second-class fish in the market and we would not get the price for it.  There was a policy to tie us up and put us and out of business.  Many other polyvalent boats were tied up over shortage of capacity.<br\/><br\/>On the other side, in 1997 or 1998, there were seven boats within the RSW sector that were newly built and had huge capacity to carry fish on temporary licences.  They came in under the safety tonnage provision.  In 2002, they had to buy tonnage out of the polyvalent sector.  They were allowed to buy tonnage out of the polyvalent sector to rectify that but in the meantime, if many other polyvalent boats were short 1 kW or one tonne, they would be tied to the pier.  In the interim, they were saying they could not allow this type of capacity.  In 2001, a massive new vessel - the <i>Atlantic Dawn<\/i>- came to Ireland.  It was 14,400 gross tons, GTs, and a new international segment was created for it.  This 14,400 GTs came out of thin air.  When the boat was sold to the Dutch in 2007, that tonnage was then brought into the RSW sector.  Why was it not brought into every sector?  It did not belong to the RSW sector.  This was a completely separate sector.  There was no consultation with the industry.  The rest of the RSW boats are allowed to buy this tonnage and get bigger and bigger while polyvalent boats have been treated as second-class vessels.<br\/><br\/>I am chairman of the Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-Operative Society limited.  We depend on mackerel fishing for jobs there, as do the factories in Baltimore, Rossaveal, Dingle and many smaller factories in Killybegs, but we cannot get access to 87% of the quota.  They flay over 80% of that quota because the factories own the boats.  Boats own factories in Killybegs and more luck to them.  I think Mr. O'Donoghue is wrong to think that there were only 23 vessels fishing pelagic species back in 1995 and that they were extracted.  There was no industry consultation.  I attended at an sea fisheries liaison group, SFLG, meeting in the south west at that time - Jason Whooley was there - and I asked Cecil Beamish what the criteria to join this club were because I was involved in pelagic fishing as well.  I am still waiting for it.  There were no public criteria setting out how one could get into this sector.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John D.

The historical record between 1976 and 1979 decided on the percentage share we got.  I am not the only one talking about the RSW.  I refer specifically to the Department's memorandum on the review where it says that the 23 dedicated RSW pelagic boats historically fished about 98% of Ireland's total mackerel catch.  It said that up to 2000, less than 1,000 tonnes were fished by the polyvalent boats.  We have now gone from 1,000 tonnes up to almost 8,000 or 9,000 so anybody telling me that I am distorting the facts is absolutely wrong.  I can stand over my figures and they have been proven.  I know people in front of me are shaking their heads but I can show these figures.  It is not just me.  The Department produced these figures as well.<\/p> <p>  While I have the floor, I would like to address Deputy Penrose's question about the extra 14%.  The Department has not allocated the extra amount of fish so it is not just a matter of taking the tonnage and splitting it.  If the review goes ahead, instead of the 27 RSW vessels having 13%, they will end up with 27%.  That is basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and will have a huge effect.  I can understand where the Deputy is coming from.  One could think that it is only 14,000 tonnes but that is not the case.  It is the percentage share that matters.

I appreciate that there needs to be humanity around this.  Unless one is permanently resident in Northern Ireland, they were not supposed to have a vessel registered under voisinage.  If vessels find that they are no longer legally allowed to fish, they have registered their vessels with the Irish State, bought their kilowatts and tonnage and have got on with it.

The reason the NIFF does not have a clear policy position on the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 is because we did not get a clear mandate from the regional forums and that is just how we operate.  The NIFF does not involve 12 people making stuff up as they go along.  We act and operate based on a mandate from the regional inland fisheries forums, so it is really about credibility.  That is just how we operate and that is the way things are.  I do not know why the regional inland fisheries forums did not give us a clear mandate but if I had to hazard a guess, I think it was because it is such a complex issue.  It is also quite a divisive issue.  A couple of people could be fishing out of the same little harbour who are affected by this in very different ways.  Was there departmental interference in this?  Did the Department put a gagging order on the regional inland fisheries forums?  The answer is \"No\".  It is my opinion that this did not happen.  The NIFF and the regional inland fisheries forums are quite free to say whatever they want.<\/p><p>Nothing has happened there.<\/p><p> On the new fisherman's association that Deputy Pringle mentioned, I am uniquely qualified to comment on that in that I am the chairman of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, and I am also the company secretary of the NIFF ACLG.  Mr. Richard Guildea is the chairman of that.  It was set up was to help those of us in the inshore forums to do a little bit more.  The committee might wonder why we would want that.  I will use today's hearing as an example.  I and my two colleagues are here in a voluntary capacity today.  Our travelling expenses will be covered and we will also get what is called a labour replacement cost of &euro;200 a day.  We are giving up our day jobs to be here.  The last train to Kerry is at 7 o'clock, so it looks like I will be giving up my day job tomorrow as well.  That is how we operate.  It helps to get us a little bit of extra help if we need it.  When I got the invitation to today's hearing, the clerk wanted to know if anyone would be assisting us today.  At first I started laughing and then I felt like crying.  Unless we pay for ourselves, we do not get any help.  The idea of a new organisation is to create a legal entity to help us help ourselves.  We hope that in future it will put us on a platform like the IFPO and the ISWFPO and we can buy in our independent outside advisers if we want to.  I was quite flattered by Deputy Penrose's comment that he found our statement helpful or useful.  That was put together by me and my two colleagues in our spare time.

I acknowledge the Chair and his courtesy towards me.  I have been in and out of this meeting today.<\/p> <p>  This has been a very useful debate on the issue of the mackerel quota itself and where we are going.  It has shed light on the issue itself.  Without doubt there is a conflict of ideals between some organisations about where we should be going with the industry.  From the presentations I have read, the actual quotas are historical to a degree.  They have been gathered up over time.<\/p> <p>  The year 1983 was mentioned.  That was the exact time that milk quotas were brought in.  We have had that debate on another industry regarding share of quota and who had it, what producers had it, and the movement of the quota.  It is a very divisive topic.  It was very important for the agricultural and dairy industry that it was freed up and made more flexible to improve the industry and allow it to move forward.  I am not saying we should free up the quota itself.  We cannot do that because of environmental issues, but the flexibility between who produced the quota on the agricultural side of things was helpful in the long run for the industry itself.<\/p> <p>  Today we have a debacle between the north and the south, to be frank about it.  How do we deal with that?  From the agricultural point of view, we have seen monopolies, such as that in the beef industry, which have been unhelpful.  We have seen these issues materialise over the years.  Are we in a situation where we might create another monopoly in the fishing sector?  How best can the sector be developed on that scale of operation?  Should it be based on one or two manufacturers or with one or two entities from either north or south?  We are looking at another issue, that of single farm payments and how they were increased in recent years.  That has been the kind of move that has been made on the agricultural side of things in a European context.  I am concerned that if we do not have the same movement on the fishery side of things, we will end up with a monopoly similar to that which we had in the beef industry.  That is a major worry.  I want to ask the witnesses for their ideas as to how we can avoid that monopoly, or a large entity controlling the entire quota itself, and what is best for the industry going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#S00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2213,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations and contributions.  It is an indication of why the fishing sector is where it is and why the fishing community is where it is.<\/p> <p>  I grew up in a fishing community, as many of the witnesses will know, and worked as a commercial fisherman for a while.  I have seen communities decimated and destroyed with the advent of the EEC and the way the then Government gave away what would have been one of the best industries in the country if it had been developed and nurtured properly, which did not happen.  In the past 12 months I have travelled to almost every port in the country and have seen at first hand how badly affected coastal communities are as a consequence of the way the fishing sector operates.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard made a point.  I am not a member of this committee now, but I have been on this committee since 2002.  I have argued from the first day I came here that a system such as the single farm payment, where certain people are getting &euro;400,000, &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 a year on single farm payments and others &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 a year, is grotesque.  It is greed at its worst.  I have argued that here, and the only person ever to recognise my point was Deputy Coveney.  I said that the single farm payment should be capped at &euro;100,000 and then reduced to &euro;50,000 over a four-year plan in order that people who had big investments would be able to make their payments.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at figures here which have not been contradicted.  There was &euro;670 million from 2007 to 2016 for the mackerel quota for the RSW boats.  The polyvalent sector came to &euro;97.5 million.  When other species are included, such as blue whiting, horse mackerel, herring, Scandinavian herring and albacore, it is alarming.  Other people in other sectors go out to make a living and are try to ensure their crew and their families are able to make a living and they cannot do that.  I sat in this forum when the decommissioning of 73 boats was applauded as if it was a great thing.  Their tonnage and megawatt allocation were then allocated to other sectors.<\/p> <p>  I am not going to be popular when I say this, but I think this is wrong.  It is wrong that there are a couple of sectors that control most of the income of an industry.  I applaud the work that has been done to build up the industry, but there should be a spirit of generosity and honesty to try to protect communities rather than individuals.  In 2013, the RSW was at &euro;54.55 million and &euro;8.15 million for the polyvalent sector.  In 2014 it jumped from &euro;54 million to &euro;127 million, and from &euro;8 million to &euro;16.4 million.<\/p><p>Last year, the figures were &euro;62 million and &euro;9.3 million, respectively.  These are huge figures and huge money.  I understand there is huge investment but we must look at the bigger picture and what is for the common good, not the individual good.  There is an onus of responsibility on all the representatives of the fishing sector here today to do the right thing for the common good, not the individual good.  That must be done.<\/p><p> Most of the people I grew up with who were involved in the sector have left it.  There are only two people trawling out of Fenit, my home port, whereas 20 years ago there were 15 or 16.  They have left.  That is only one port, and that has happened all along the coast.  Decommissioning became Government policy.  What is the way ahead?  Perhaps the people who oppose it would explain what is wrong with taking it from one sector and giving something to the weaker sectors.  The National Inland Fisheries Forum has said it is prepared to accept the ISWFPO proposal because it puts 9.3 million back into the whitefish sector.  There must be give and take here, and there is a responsibility on everyone who is in a position of authority in the various sectors to show that sense of leadership and generosity.  That is the only way.  Consider that 20 years from now there might be many fewer than the 23 or the 27, and the 2,000 or so other people will be almost gone.  Is that what the representatives want, to see hundreds of people going?<\/p><p> There are probably a couple of hundred people leaving it every year at present because there is nothing there for them.  Consider the crews on parts of the south coast and the terrible tragedy that occurred at Union Hall when Caitlin U&iacute; Aodha's husband and his crew were lost.  There was one Irish crew member.  Why is that?  No one is going into the sector because they cannot make a living, yet the witnesses can say &euro;670 million and &euro;97.6 million over ten years.  It is up to the representatives to sort it out.  They will not sort it out by bickering and saying they want this and someone else has to have something else.  It is up to themselves, but what will happen at the end of the day will be on their shoulders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#S00400","speaker":"1317","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2215,"content":"<p>Some of the presentations referred to the whitefish quota and how it is allocated.

Those six years were the period on foot of which the 1983 Common Fisheries Policy, grounded on the concept of relative stability, was founded.  As I understand it, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has lost the records on catches for those six years.  I also believe that in that period, far from there being 23 RSW tank boats engaged in fishing for mackerel in the Klondikers, the Russian factory ships, in Berehaven or in north Donegal, there was a maximum of five.  I can give the committee the names of the people who owned them, but I will not say it in an open forum.  One of them was in the Aran Islands, one was from Berehaven and one was from north-west Mayo.  I will not go further than that.<\/p> <p>  The balance of the 23 gradually acquired that type of fishing vessel between the coming into force of the 1983 Common Fisheries Policy and the operation of the multi-annual guidance programmes, MAGP, under the 1992 Common Fisheries Policy which directed that the fleets be segmented.  Segmentation occurred in private in the mid-1990s.  Segmentation of the fleet and the requirement to have it were abolished by the EU in a Council regulation of December 2002.  While that was taking place, Ireland was conducting a licensing review or consultation with the industry.  That started in the summer of 2001 and it finished in November 2002.  Policy directives were issued from the beginning of 2003 in accordance with the Fisheries Act.  Issues surrounding the abolition of segmentation at EU level were not allowed to be considered by that review, even though Europe was getting rid of this tank boat, polyvalent, pelagic, beamer or whatever segment one wishes to call it.  Europe had decided by that stage that segmentation should have been abolished following 1 January 2003.  Ireland has never done that.  Not alone has it not done it, it has sat into it and imposed a system of apartheid between segments which has caused or allowed a buildup of enormous imbalance between those who have the entitlement to the 87% of the mackerel quota and the 27 boats that have the 13%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062000002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Casey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2219,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Ferris.

We hope we can continue to interact meaningfully with the committee and I would also like to acknowledge the ongoing interaction between the secretariat and the Oireachtas staff to support these meetings.<\/p> <p>  The IFAC published its 12th assessment report on the 7 of June.  The report covers all aspects of the council&rsquo;s mandate, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013.  The report assesses: the macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts in the Government&rsquo;s 2017 stability programme update; compliance with Irish and EU fiscal rules; and the appropriateness of the broader fiscal stance.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the fiscal position.  It is worth noting the significant progress that has been achieved in resolving Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal crisis.  Ireland&rsquo;s underlying deficit was brought below 3% of GDP in 2015 from a peak of 11.5% of GDP in 2009.  This achievement reflected a sustained effort at consolidating the public finances by successive governments.  The efforts made since 2008 have helped to finally put debt levels on a declining path.  While debt is expected to rise in euro terms over the coming years, it is expected to decline steadily as a percentage of total government revenue.  Strong economic growth, record low interest rates, and the move toward a balanced budget help underpin this turnaround.  In turn, this has helped to restore the State&rsquo;s capacity to borrow independently but significant challenges remain both from a macroeconomic and fiscal perspective.  On the fiscal side, high debt levels limit our room for manoeuvre.  Net debt, which strips out the government&rsquo;s cash and liquid asset holdings, increased from &euro;26 billion at the end of 2006 to more than &euro;175 billion at the end of 2016 and this continues to rise, albeit much more slowly.<\/p> <p>  Measuring Ireland&rsquo;s debt against GDP has become increasingly meaningless, given recent distortions.  Current debt levels are equivalent to 2.4 times the total annual revenue of the Government, whereas pre-crisis levels were equivalent to just 0.4 times total revenue and the current EU average is 1.5.  Ireland&rsquo;s net debt-to-revenue ratio remains the fourth highest in Europe, behind Greece, Portugal and Cyprus.<\/p> <p>  On the macroeconomic front, there are risks in the short-run that the recent cyclical recovery in employment and output could continue more strongly than is envisaged in the latest forecasts.  This could even lead to overheating, for example, if the property market were to respond more rapidly to persistent supply shortfalls.  The latest Department of Finance macro-forecasts imply that the number of new houses completed each year would steadily increase by around 3,000 units until annual completions reach 30,000 in 2021 - but it might increase much faster.  The IFAC  would welcome a recovery in housing supply, but notes that higher than normal levels of new house completions might be required for some time to address a large backlog or pent-up demand.  Put simply, if we need 30,000 to 35,000 housing units each year, as the ESRI suggest is consistent with structural demand, then we might need to produce more than this until any backlog is sufficiently dealt with.  Producing more housing units would lead to faster growth and faster tax revenues but would not be expected to last forever.  Instead, high levels of output might only be expected to last until such time as the backlog is addressed before eventually returning to more normal levels.  Previous research by the ESRI suggests that an additional 10,000 new house completions would add one percentage point to GNP growth and this would likely be tax-rich in nature.  We need to consider how we would deal with any faster than normal, and likely transient, growth in revenues.<\/p> <p>  An appropriate way to deal with cyclical risks like those potentially arising from housing would be to allow supply to recover and even exceed normal levels, while recognising that the associated revenues would be transient.  Looking through short-run developments and increasing spending in line with the economy&rsquo;s sustainable growth rate would be a sensible way to manage the economy and public finances.  To manage the public finances prudently, we need to think carefully about what growth rates - and by extension, government revenues - might be considered sustainable.  Looking further ahead, the IFAC sees risks that trend growth rates for Ireland might be weaker than was previously thought.  This could happen if a harder than expected Brexit occurs, or if risks related to US economic and tax policy were to materialise.  Productivity, which is the key driver of growth in the long run, has important links to trade but Brexit could decrease trade, and exporters face significant challenges in diversifying into other markets.<\/p> <p>  Having achieved a general government deficit of less than 3% of GDP in 2015, Ireland entered the domestic budgetary rule and graduated from the corrective part of the EU&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact to its preventive arm.  The rules help prevent governments repeating policy mistakes that contributed to crises in recent decades.  The new framework can help us to withstand future shocks, and help to prevent overheating.  The rules help us to avoid using cyclical or transitory revenues to fund permanent spending increases, while allowing faster spending growth if it is funded by sustainable revenues.  So far, Ireland has shown a minimalist approach to compliance with the fiscal rules.<\/p><p>This is the first two years in which the new budgetary framework operates.  A breach was observed in 2016 and further breaches are planned for 2017.  Such breaches can result in levels of spending that are permanently higher than would have been the case if the rules were complied with.  If repeated, we could end up with spending levels that outstrip the pace at which Government revenues can sustainably grow. <\/p><p> Strengthening Ireland's fiscal framework is an important, positive legacy of the economic crisis and one which the Government has committed to respecting.  The Oireachtas, the Council and the wider public have roles in monitoring and enforcing the national rules.  The framework should help to make future boom-bust cycles less severe, guide Government debt to safer levels  and underpin borrowing capacity during a period when high debt levels will leave Ireland vulnerable to shocks.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that constraints imposed by the rules are likely to be less severe than the constraints that can also be imposed by debt markets.  As experienced by Ireland in 2010, debt markets can be even more demanding in terms of the fiscal policies viewed as consistent with access to funding to cover deficits and roll-over debts.  A credible commitment to a framework that ensures debt sustainability can also allow Ireland to expand rather than narrow the room for fiscal manoeuvre.<\/p><p> Our assessment is that plans should remain consistent with this new framework beyond 2018.  At that time, the rules will allow us to expand budgetary policy more in line with the economy's sustainable pace of growth, while steadily reducing debt levels sticking to the spending rule - the expenditure benchmark - after that would be a sensible guide for fiscal policy.  While not a formal requirement, this position would go some way towards avoiding a fiscal policy that aggravates the boom-bust cycle.<\/p><p> To conclude, I thank the committee for again providing us with an opportunity to attend today.  We look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2249,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey.

She is correct to say that prior to that we had said it would be prudent to increase fiscal space to between &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.2 billion for the budget.  Yes, the budget went beyond that.  In November 2016 we said that expenditure went beyond what was prudent and was inappropriate for the economy both from a fiscal perspective, managing the public finances, and from an economic perspective.<\/p> <p>  In terms of public finances, one might say that the impacts are small.  The breach of the expenditure benchmark was &euro;200 million.  The additional &euro;200 million in a sense is baked in and occurs each year.  If one gets repeated breaches of the fiscal rules - as we are getting - there will be a build-up of spending and maybe tax cuts above what would sustainably be allowed.  It is not simply a case of small breaches.  Once one adds them up one gets to a significant position.  We have only been in this part of the fiscal framework for two years.  It looks like we have breached the rules for 2016 and are set to breach them for 2017.  If those patterns continue there is a potential that public finances will be in a more vulnerable position than they would have been if we had adhered to the fiscal framework.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what impact Brexit will have on the fiscal framework.  One impact of not adhering to it is that we would not be in as strong a fiscal position to deal with the impact of Brexit as we might otherwise be.  She spoke about the benefits of Brexit.  At the moment much of the focus is on how much Brexit will cost the Irish economy.  If it does bring costs, we would like to be in a position to deal with them and absorb them.  When one wants additional fiscal effort to deal with such problems then one wants to have it available.  If we have already used the additional fiscal effort then it will not be available.  Ireland has a history spanning 50 years of using fiscal resources when they were not needed and not having them available when they were needed.  That is the cycle that we want to break.  It is unclear whether we have moved far enough away from the old patterns to allow that to happen.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the benefits of Brexit, a hard Brexit has been built into the current macroeconomic forecasts.  One could say there is an upside if Brexit does not turn out as hard as envisaged.  Let us consider the growth forecast produced by the Department of Finance.  It has already knocked half a percentage point off the GDP growth rates for most years out to 2021.  Depending on the outcome of the negotiations, maybe Brexit will not be as hard as that.  <\/p> <p>  It is not the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's role to judge whether Brexit is beneficial.  If the UK leaves the customs union and the Single Market there is potential for Ireland to benefit but it is very difficult to say what form that will take.  There has been some focus on the financial world and whether financial companies would move.  From an Irish perspective, I am sure we are interested in employment.  It is unclear how Ireland could benefit from companies moving their head office or the licensing part of their operations.  The key issue for us is the potential impact Brexit could have on trade out of Ireland.  If there is a hard Brexit and trade barriers imposed then Ireland's potential growth rate would be lower.  Irish companies must find different markets and are well used to dealing with the UK market.  From a food perspective, both countries have similar tastes.  We make products that we consume and they consume but it may not be as easy to enter other markets.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the breaches of the fiscal rules in the past number of years, the breach in 2016 was primarily in terms of the structural benchmark or deficit.  In terms of the continued improvement we must make in our deficit, we brought it below 3% of GDP but it was still a deficit.  There is a requirement to move to what is called a balanced budget in structural terms.  A balanced budget is deemed to be -0.5% of GDP, to which we must make steady improvements.  The requirement is to improve by 0.6% percentage points of GDP each year.  There was a 0.3% improvement in GDP in the outturn for 20016.  That means we were 0.3% short.  <\/p> <p>  The expenditure benchmark is the other rule.  Ireland, under the rules that applied at the time, did not breach the expenditure benchmark in 2016.  That was primarily due to a technical adjustment that was not made.  There was an AIB transaction in 2015 that allowed additional spending.  We did not breach the expenditure benchmark.<\/p> <p>  It looks like both rules will be breached in 2017 and, thus, we would not have the required improvement in the structural balance.  We are supposed to improve it by 0.6 percentage points of GDP.  We are not getting there fast enough.  Again, a breach of the expenditure benchmark has been planned for.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the principle that sets the amount of fiscal space or how much one can increase expenditure.  Given what has been done in revenue, and we have had some revenue reducing measures that limits expenditure, yet we have increased expenditure above the expenditure benchmark, and it is planned to breach that in 2017.  One could say that the breaches that took place in the two years were minor but they do start to accumulate.<\/p> <p>  The final topic that the Deputy raised was housing and overheating the property market.  One of the problems that we see at the moment is that the housing supply is so low and, thus, problems are building up.  It is pretty clear that housing output is below the equilibrium level.  The longer that situation persists the greater the chance of pent-up or unmet demand.  When housing output does begin to increase, not alone will we have the equilibrium level of output that we want to have to meet ongoing demand, we will have the legacy problem of five years of reduced output.  Output could ramp-up pretty quickly, not necessarily from the public sector but, equally, from the private sector.  The latter has the potential to increase much faster.  There is a concern how that situation will impact on the economy.  The employment rate has hit 6% and growth remains quite strong.  The economy will probably grow by between 5% and 6%, which is above it long-run equilibrium growth rate.  There is difficulty in measuring that but it is probably somewhere between 3% and 4%.<\/p><p>The economy is growing above that at present.  If we were to ramp up housing output, and if it does ramp up, where are the workers going to come from if the unemployment rate is dropping?  Are we going to lose workers from other sectors?  Are people going to transfer to construction?  Will this lead to wage pressures as there is competition for workers?  Perhaps workers could be imported through net inward migration but they would require housing.  We would be bringing in workers to solve a problem that they are adding to.  The issue is whether there is the space in the economy, both the fiscal space to fund additional public spending on housing and the resource space is available.  At present we see no overheating in the economy.  The unemployment rate is low, but at 6% there is still some capacity in the labour market.  We are not seeing a large increase in credit, which would be an issue in respect of an economy that could potentially be overheating.  What we would like to get is a much clearer picture on our external position.  Are we borrowing money from abroad?  Are we living within our means?  At present our external position is hugely influenced by the impact of the multinationals.  It shows Ireland having a huge balance of payments surplus in that there is far more money coming into the Irish economy than leaving.  If that is accruing to multinational companies, it is not necessarily giving us a true position of where the underlying position of the Irish economy is.  The CSO has promised to give us an improved measure over the next couple of weeks.  If we look at an indicator of where an economy is going, the current account, the flow of money in and out of a country is a very important indicator.  We do not have that at present.  Across the range of indicators we have looked at, we do not see overheating pressures but we see the potential to move in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2254,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Following Mr. Coffey's fairly extensive answer, I wish to raise two points.  In regard to the calculation, Mr. Coffey said fairly trenchantly that measuring Ireland&rsquo;s debt against GDP has become increasingly meaningless, given recent distortions and so on.  The proposals being discussed by the CSO and other bodies about recalculating that in respect of GNI* has also led to a situation where at this committee last week, one of the assistant secretaries in the Department of Finance spoke a debt to GDP target of 45% into the long run.  I would like to know whether the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council shares the view that Ireland needs a very significant infrastructure investment in order to modernise the economy and to keep the economy competitive pre-Brexit and post-Brexit, in particular in areas such as public transport and finishing off the roads network, which is incomplete, especially in large sections of the west coast and the connections between the major cities of Cork and Limerick.  Are the two aspirations inconsistent - in other words, the suggestion has been made but there has been no detailed work that I am aware of that PPPs could replace direct Government spending on infrastructure.  However, from what I know of EUROSTAT, and the witnesses probably know a great deal more of its inner working, EUROSTAT increasingly is looking unfavourably on PPPs, as being rather much the same as direct infrastructure projects because if one builds a public hospital or a public road, even if the financing is done by private means or through private mechanisms, essentially the State carries the risk, because it cannot close down a public hospital, a public road or a public courthouse built by a PPP.  That is not going to happen.  We have several examples from the UK, including Scotland, and from different parts of Europe that PPPs are a particular construct.  Mr. Coffey commented on the measurement of the debt to GDP ratio being largely meaningless, does he share the approach in developing this GNI*?  If so, could he give us an explanation in simple English of what it means?  We feel we have stars in our eyes in relation to GNI*, not being mathematicians.  I am very concerned about the very hardline stance of the Department of Finance.  Last year when it came to the budget, this committee was told by the Department of Finance that it was all signed off but on budget day, it was very significantly different.  That was pretty much on the day before the budget; it was not months or weeks in arrears.  Will Mr. Coffey give us his thoughts on this?  We are preparing for the scrutiny of this year's budget and we have a stand by the Department of Finance of working to a debt level of 45% of GDP.  We also have an infrastructural deficit - I do not know if the IFAC shares that view - which needs to be addressed.  How do we reconcile these two apparently irreconcilables?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#D00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2255,"content":"<p>There are two issues, one on the GNI* and an explanation of it and the measuring and calculation of debt and infrastructural investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#D00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2256,"content":"<p>I will let Mr. Coffey speak about GNI* because he is the nerd in that area rather than me.<br\/><br\/>Let me address the debt level, at EU level the requirement is still to get to 60% of GDP but GDP is becoming increasingly distorted from our point of view and that is why the previous Minister for Finance decided we should be aiming at 45% rather than 60%, taking account of the 26% increase in our GDP in 2015.  From a practical point of view that was really adjusting for that 26% increase.  The 45% was really pretty well equivalent to the previous 60%.  It was not that he was trying to do something even more than had been set out before.  We would certainly agree with that approach because our debt is still rather high.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out in one of his last speeches, on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, Ireland's debt is the fourth highest in the world, behind Japan, the USA and Singapore.  Looking at it on a <i>per capita <\/i>basis, we are above every other European country.  In terms of GDP, we are a little below some of the others but in <i>per capita<\/i>terms we are still very high and we are still borrowing money.  We need to get the debt level down in order to protect ourselves from shocks in the future and to give more room for manoeuvrer whenever there is a downturn once again.  On that basis, we certainly support the aim of getting down to 45% or even below it in terms of GDP to debt ratio and getting it down in terms of our share of revenue or GNI to the appropriate level.<br\/><br\/>We certainly agree there is a need for infrastructural expenditure.  The only issue is whether we have to borrow more or to change priorities in terms of what we are doing with the existing resources.  We know that during the bad times capital expenditure was cut far more than other areas, but it is not clear that going off to borrow more money for capital expenditure is the way rather than to use the fiscal space for capital expenditure as opposed to current expenditure or tax reductions.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Mr. Coffey to speak on GNI*.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Tutty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2257,"content":"<p>In terms of GNI*, traditionally, the view in Ireland would have been that to get a measure of Irish national income, one would subtract the profits of the foreign multinationals and go from GDP, the measure of output to GNP, the measure of income, and one would have net factor income from abroad, how much of the profit earned here accrues to shareholders abroad, primarily in the US.  Until recently that adjustment would have been sufficient.  GNP would have given a pretty useful measure of what was happening to the incomes of Ireland and Irish residents.  That would have been standard way of doing it.  There is a gap between GDP and GNP.  Until recently, it may have been appropriate to put some of these ratios, just in terms of GNP to get an Irish comparison.  Now that has been distorted itself.  We have additional factors that are causing the measure of national income that was previously used to be further distorted.<\/p><p>For example, some of the companies are redomiciling to Ireland.  Where are the profits being attributed to?  Not only do we have US companies setting up operations in Ireland, but some have redomiciled here in recent years in so-called inversions.  In this way, companies do not change their presence in Ireland and retain their presence around the world.  If a company has a factory in the US, Germany or Kinsale, the profit generated by that factory gets attributed to the US.  When the company redomiciles to Ireland, the profit generated by its factory in New Jersey or Germany gets attributed to Ireland.  If the company distributes the profit as dividends to its shareholders, that is not an issue because there is money in, money out and the net effect is zero, but these companies do not distribute all their profits as dividends.  Rather, they retain them for investment and many other purposes.  As long as these companies have retained earnings that they are using for investment, it is counted as Irish income, but it is worth nothing to Irish people.  Companies domiciled here might generate profits in Germany and invest them in France, but it is counted as Irish income.  GNI* will account for these redomiciled companies by stripping out that income.<\/p><p> A second factor that is influencing the Irish measure of income has been the onshoring or shifting of intangible assets to Ireland, mainly by US companies.  Once the intangible comes to Ireland, a large amount of profit is attributed to it.  Many US companies generate their profits through their intellectual properties, IPs, for example, pharmaceutical companies with patents and products or communications technology companies with their software, branding or products.  Once they shift their IPs to Ireland, the profit is declared here.  One might not believe this to be an issue and that the profits attributed to Ireland will be stripped out in the traditional way before returning to the measure of Irish national income, but the issue is that the measures are all gross, for example, gross domestic product and gross national product.  When these IPs - these intangible assets - are moved to Ireland, there is a large amount of depreciation.  An intangible asset might be worth a great deal now, but if a patent or licence for a product has a fixed life, its value is written down as the end of that life nears.  These assets are depreciating in value.  They earn large profits that are attributed to Ireland, but nothing flows from them.  Due to the depreciation, they do not show up in the accounts.<\/p><p> The role of GNI* is to correct for these two factors.  It strips out the earnings of redomiciled plcs that are not attributable to Irish residence and accounts for the depreciation of intangible assets.  The profits being generated by assets in Ireland are not going to Irish people.  The traditional shift of stripping out the profits of US multinationals to go from GDP to GNP will still happen, but GNI* proposes two further adjustments: to account for the profits of redomiciled plcs, which in recent years amounted to a significant sum of between &euro;8 billion and &euro;10 billion; and to account for the depreciation associated with the IPs that are relocated to Ireland, which could be between &euro;25 billion and &euro;30 billion.  These will be significant adjustments when they are made, given that the factors in question contributed to a 26% GDP growth.  GNI* should give us a better indication of what is happening to the income of Irish residents.  That is the hope.  Perhaps there will be other distortions further down the line, but those two are significant.<\/p><p> The CSO will publish GNI* in the coming weeks, including on an historical basis for previous years, so we should be able to see what actually happened in 2015.  We had a 26% GDP growth rate as well as an 18% GNP growth.  We would like to know how the economy grew in 2016 and whether there were similar distortions.  The future data sets will be useful.  GNI* will allow us to get a better indication of the underlying position of the economy.<\/p><p> We would love to be able to answer the question on whether there is an infrastructure deficit in Ireland.  This is not unique to Ireland.  Most countries have poor data on their public capital stock.  In terms of roads, buildings, schools, hospitals and transport, do we know how we compare with other countries?  In that respect especially, it is difficult for us to know how we stand.  We do not know whether we have an infrastructure deficit.  We can say that we do, but it can be difficult to know what is happening in other countries to allow for that comparison to be made.  Someone could argue for one project over another in terms of public transport, roads, hospitals and so on, but that is not the job of the IFAC.  We examine the overall fiscal situation.<\/p><p> I tend to agree with EUROSTAT's view of where the risk in public private partnerships lies.  The risk should not be shifted off the balance sheet, particularly in transport projects where a fixed number of users is required for the companies that developed the projects and the Government has to make up the shortfall.  It is clear that the risk lies with the government sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2259,"content":"<p>Mr. Casey wished to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#E00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2260,"content":"<p>On the debt target, these are useful innovations, but it is important to remember they are being targeted for the mid-2020s, which is far away.

Once we reach the medium-term deficit objective, we will no longer have to make that improvement.  In a sense, the space that is taken up each year by making improvements will be available for use.  We should be in a position to grow spending net of discretionary measures at the long-run potential growth of the economy.  To make improvements now, we should be growing spending at less than the long-run potential growth of the economy.  Once we reach the MTO, there will no longer be a need for that improvement.  In the expenditure benchmark, this is called the convergence margin, that is, how quickly one must converge with one's MTO.  This should be limiting our current spending.  Once the MTO is reached in 2018, the convergence margin no longer applies.  Hence, we will get more space in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  There is so far that we must go and the rules require us to reach a balanced budget in structural terms.  The issue for us is that we are not reaching that at the required pace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2271,"content":"<p>I appreciate the chance to get the witnesses' advice.  I will make a couple of comments first.  Mr. Coffey made a good point about the question of how to compare one country with another.  An interesting experiment - a survey unlike any other - is under way currently.  With Brexit, everyone is leaving London, but people are not coming to Dublin.  As much as we would like them to, they will not go to Longford or Leitrim either, but they could come to Dublin.  However, they are not coming here because of housing, transport, schools, etc.  This is clear if one asks them why they are instead going to Luxembourg, Berlin or Paris.  They would love to come to Dublin, but they cannot because there is no infrastructure.<\/p><p>It is one real life measure by which it could be tested.  That is the market in which we are competing.<br\/><br\/>Representatives from the Department of Finance were before the committee last week.  God help us in terms of our economic data.  We have real difficulties understanding what the size of our economy is.  The witnesses are adding, correctly, to it today.  We also have real concern about what our balance of payments is.  We do not know some of the basic figures.  In addition to the concern raised by the witnesses in that regard, another concern was raised by a representative from the Department of Finance who said the top five exporting companies account for 37% of our total exports.  If we lost those five companies, we could lose 40% of our balance of payments.  It is incredible.  There are very few other economies in that sort of precarious position.  <br\/><br\/>I will add a third caveat that the whole discipline of economics is in a state of complete crisis.  It must be a shocking profession to be in at the moment when no one really believes anything in terms of the economic analysis.  Kate Raworth, who wrote <i>Doughnut Economics<\/i>, says the basic tenets of the textbooks should be thrown out.  The first lesson I learned in economics is that people are profit maximisers.  However, all the assumptions of all the models arising from that have been completely debunked because we are not just profit maximisers.  There is more to life than just making a profit.  God help us because we are in a difficult situation in terms of making economic decisions.  In a sense, one of the policy choices we have is in terms of the size of the State within the economy, however it is measured.  As we have to live within fiscal rules, the choice is between a higher tax and higher spending policy approach versus a smaller one.  We have a choice in budgets between giving tax cuts and increasing spending.  Framing it in that way might help in some of the policy choices.  Given what I have said about the infrastructure deficit, if the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council had a choice, as a policy maker, between a tax cut and a capital spending increase, what would it decide?  Can it come to that level of political decision-making?  <br\/><br\/>One of the ways in which we could assess things, given it is difficult because the economic figures are so uncertain, is to try to get assessments of productivity in all investment decisions and productivity increases.  I am interested to know if the witnesses have any particular analysis of that.  When it comes to infrastructure investment decisions, if we could show real productivity growth increases, perhaps it would overcome some of the concerns about the long-term budget implications.<br\/><br\/>Has the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council done further research or consideration on the risks to us in terms of not meeting our carbon targets?  My understanding of the latest negotiations with Europe is we are facing a much more onerous 2030 regime.  We may be starting from where we were expected to be in 2020 rather than from where we actually are.  That more onerous approach might see not-insignificant fines, in the many hundreds of millions, introduced in 2021 and 2022 rather than later.  Has the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council done any analysis or research on the fiscal risk involved in the failure to meet our carbon targets, given how far removed from them we are?  The latest noises from Germany and France indicate they may be looking for us to count our targets straight away in 2020 rather than getting the pass we seem to be getting from the Commission, which would mean they would only really kick in in 2027.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#E01400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2273,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about four areas: risks regarding carbon targets, productivity assessments, choices between tax cuts and capital spending, and the size of the State in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#F00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2274,"content":"<p>On discussions of the size of the State and matching expenditure with revenues, it is very much the role of the fiscal rules, and it is the fiscal council's view, that any spending by the Government is sustainable.

Beyond that, we do not make any particular recommendations on the allocation of spending and how it is distributed between taxes and current and capital spending.  Our view is very much on the aggregate levels and that spending is sustainable and matched by regular revenues.  With regard to the Deputy's first comment on the concentration of Irish exports, it is also a concern in terms of the concentration of corporate taxes.  The volatility and concentration of corporate taxes is something the fiscal council has raised a number of times in terms of the risks of spending and of translating volatile one-off surges in revenues into permanent increases in expenditure, which gives rise to different risks.<\/p> <p>  If used productively, infrastructure spending will potentially feed through into the long-term potential growth rate of the economy and that is one of the objectives that determines the amount of expenditure that is allowed.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of carbon targets being addressed, it is something the current fiscal assessment report mentioned.

In terms of capital spending, the Deputy asked if it would be justified if there was sufficient productivity growth.  In that sense and in all senses it is important to carry out the appropriate analysis of the projects that are being envisaged to establish whether they offer value for money and improve the infrastructure and areas where the deficit is felt.  It is important to undertake the appropriate analysis of the spending.  We have looked at the plans for capital spending that the current Government has and the figures in the most recent stability programme update.  Although it is not getting there at a very fast rate, when we get to 2021, under existing plans, capital spending will return to what are considered typical levels for Ireland if one takes a long-run average from the mid-1990s right through to now.  Although capital spending is below typical levels at the moment, if the plans as outlined are adhered to, capital spending will rise over the next couple of years to get back to those.  Capital spending by the Government is due to rise this year by 10%, which is quite a rapid rate of growth and pretty high growth rates built in for the next number of years will get us back to more typical levels.  We have to make an assessment of whether that is appropriate, as my colleague Dr. Lawless said.  It is not really the fiscal council's job to say the Government should be allocating money to tax cuts or capital spending.  We look at the overall pattern.

We have had some very good and positive inward investment stories recently of companies choosing to come in so there are a lot of positive reasons to relocate to Ireland.  I will not go into the details of some of the stuff we are losing to Luxembourg but my understanding is that our regulators are looking at things in quite a good way and are ensuring we do not have inward investment that we will regret attracting at a later stage.<\/p><p>What Luxembourg chooses to do is its own business.<\/p><p> I ask a question I have asked previously, and it goes back to another point.  A great deal of effort was put into devising our own standard to examine the problem we are having with gross domestic product, GDP.  GDP is an accepted internationally measured standard.  I refer to having this conversation in a parliament in Norway, South America or whatever.  Is there not a risk that we are going to a great deal of effort to create something that will have no international credibility because nobody else will use it?  It is possible that it could be slightly damaging to our country because if other countries were applying a similar type standard, we might wonder where they would be coming up.  My point is that I do not believe we will be able to change the world use of GDP and, therefore, I question the reason we have gone to such elaborate lengths to create something.  The exercise could be done in a technical way.  GDP will still be GDP, yet we have gone down this route.<\/p><p> In terms of the investment and Mr. Tutty's answer in that regard and to some of the follow-up questions, does he have a position he would definitively support that capital investment should be funded, even if that is by borrowing?

What has been proposed for the CSO by a group, which has been put together to examine it, is not to change GDP.  It will continue to be measured in Ireland, the figures will continue to be reported and they will continue to be used internationally.  Many of our legal obligations are set in terms of GDP, so GDP figures will continue to be set out.  Gross domestic product is a measure of output and what happens within the borders of a country.  A huge amount of what happens within the borders of the Irish economy is driven by the presence of multinational companies so while they are generating output and profits, those profits are not accruing to Irish residents.  We would like to know what is happening to the earnings of Irish residents, and that is the reason we need to make some of these adjustments.<\/p> <p>  Will GNI* be recognised internationally?  The answer is \"No\".  It is complicated enough to explain it here where people might have some understanding of what is happening in the Irish economy.  In terms of talking about redomiciled PLCs and onshoring of IP  internationally, whatever glazing over of eyes happens when one tries to explain that to Irish people, it will not happen internationally.  GNI* will not be recognised internationally.  What we would like to get is a growth rate so that we could determine what is happening to the Irish economy and the incomes of Irish people, get a better measure of the Irish economy that way and have that feed into policy.  A 26% GDP growth rate should not be driving any policy in Ireland.  We would like to know what is happening to the Irish economy as opposed to the economy in Ireland.  GNI* is important.  I do not necessarily believe it has reputational damage for Ireland.  Much of the damage was done by a 26% GDP growth rate.  Stripping out some of the factors that caused that should have a positive implication if we can now say, \"There are particular circumstances in Ireland.  There is 26% growth in GDP, but let us do a bit of hand waving, see what is happening on the ground and get this measured GNI*.\"  I do not believe there will be reputational damage.  It is a problem that has to be addressed, but it is very much for a domestic audience.  The European Commission will not assess us in terms of GNI*.

It is quite large but the hope is that it will continue to grow.

If we believe that 30,000 to 35,000 housing units are needed per year, we are clearly well below that at the moment.  There has been a build-up of pent-up, unmet demand for a period of three, four or five years.  The longer housing supply remains low, the more the pent-up demand becomes.

Do we consider the revenue that 50,000 houses per year might bring in as being permanent, build that into our fiscal arithmetic and then suddenly finding that housing output falls?  Again, given the nature of the Irish economy, it might not just fall to 30,000 but lower again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1497970800,"counter":2298,"content":"<p>I completely get the point.  I read the documentation so I get the point.  I wish to underline, however, that a double standard is being applied here.  Mr. Coffey is arguing for prudence and great care when it comes to counting revenue or the economic impact of dealing with the backlog in housing - with which we absolutely have to deal - through increasing supply through construction, but not applying the same prudence when it comes to the distorting, unbalancing effect of foreign direct investment.  We agree, I believe, that there should not be debt financing of any of these things and that we should keep an eye on them.  Given what Mr. Coffey is saying and the distortion effects, involving in one case an actual social crisis which must be dealt with - namely, the housing supply crisis - and which is macroeconomic in nature at a range of levels, would it not be logical to say that if addressing those should be done by debt financing, it must be done by raising extra tax revenue?  This is what we have always advocated.  I agree on what we have do to regarding housing.  Mr. Coffey seems to be saying we have to do it.  I agree we have to do it.  This gives rise to a question as to the most prudent place to raise the extra tax revenue.  Would it not be logical and prudent, in the interests of macroeconomic balance - with which the council is concerned, although remaining careful about policy - to increase investment in that area from the revenues in those distorted sectors, as we have argued for some time?  This might have the advantage of, to some extent, putting a lid on the more dangerous aspects of those sectors.  I refer to raising extra taxes from the vulture funds, which are now distorting the property market and walking away paying almost no tax, and the multinational sector.  From a macro-economic point of view, is that not the most obvious and prudent place to get the extra revenue we need to finance what is required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062000002#H00900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497970800,"counter":2299,"content":"<p>In principle, absolutely.

I wrote to him earlier this month seeking some  clarification on this.  We had an engagement with the Department on this issue but the Commission in its report stated: \"Overall, the Council is of the opinion that further measure will be needed, notably in 2017...\".  This is in regard to a breach and the background to it is the AIB transaction in 2015, which allowed for the baseline to be increased, and now that one-offs are being disregarded, it has retrospectively said that this one-off should be disregarded as well.  That means the &euro;1 billion the fiscal council had in the baseline is now gone and the expenditure benchmark has been breached to such an extent that, to use the Commission's words \"further measures will be needed, notably in 2017\".  The then Minister said that his officials had been taking this issue up bilaterally with the European Commission.  I queried that with the Department and its officials had been involved in bilateral discussions with the Commission before it published its report.  The Commission was of the view that it still needed to state this.

The Commission is saying we are in breach but the fiscal council did not even mention that in its report.

Our reply is in the process of being produced.  We have to check various things because it is not our analysis that is being assessed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the broader question the Deputy asked about the breach of the expenditure benchmark, we point out in our report that if one takes the AIB transaction into account, the expenditure benchmark would have been breached, but at the time the policy was set, one-offs were not taken into account for the expenditure benchmark.  When the AIB transaction was classified in April 2016, the fiscal council came out and stated in both the fiscal assessment report of that June and the prebudget statement prior to that budget that the fiscal space generated by the reclassification of the AIB transaction should not be used to increase spending.

In July we had additional spending and the budget had additional spending on the basis of using that AIB transaction.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of what the fiscal council wanted, we did not want to see the increases in spending that were allowed by the classification of the AIB transaction and we were explicit about that.  However, when it comes to the letter of the law, when the budget was set and when the spending was increased, the one-offs were not taken into account in the expenditure benchmark.  It is a bit of a flaw in the fiscal rules in that we have a structural balance rule which takes into account one-offs and up to now we have had the expenditure benchmark which did not.  Fixing it is a remedy that the fiscal rules need, but that remedy was not agreed until December 2016 and it was not published in the set of rules used for assessing the fiscal rules until April of this year.  Therefore, we are talking about policy decisions taken in July 2016 and in October 2016 for a decision not reached until December 2016.

It considered a range scenarios from a soft Brexit to a hard Brexit but there are a few problems with the central scenario that the Department uses for its medium-term forecast, which are for the hard Brexit in that the COSMO model assumes several things.  One is that the impact on the UK is basically the same as any other trading partner, so it is as labour intensive in terms of exports to the UK as it is in terms of exports to the Maltese economy, Luxembourg and to any other member state.  We know there are much greater connections between the UK and Ireland and the labour intensity of these relationships is much greater.  An exporter from Ireland to the UK tends to employ many more than a exporter to much more distant locations involved in, for example, the pharma industry.<\/p><p>That is one impact that could lead to greater effects on the economy if it not accounted for correctly.  COSMO, the ESRI structural econometric model of the Irish economy, by its nature of simplifying assumptions does not do that.<\/p><p> There is another possible area where the impact could be greater.  COSMO tends to have a smooth impact on growth and the economy's shock from this.  We know from examining other cases of countries dis-unifying or splitting up and having to export in future that often the impacts can be very non-linear and can happen very quickly or overnight.  That is another area of concern.<\/p><p> It seems that exchange rate impacts were not taken into account in the Estimates produced for the Department as well.  This could lead to additional negative impacts, but possibly not as severe as we might think.  This is because exporters in the UK are subject to greater costs.  Potentially, the competitiveness effects in Ireland are not as great as one might expect.<\/p><p> There are other downside risks but there are great uncertainties in both directions.

We have been comforted in recent years in the sense that every time we ask a parliamentary question, the concentration levels are coming down.  It used to be 40% and now it is 37% for the top ten companies, although I found out last week through questioning Revenue officials that the top ten is really the top nine, because two of the top ten companies are in the same group.  It was said that the concentration had just got more concentrated.  That would have been a great line if it was mine, but it came from the Revenue officials.  It is concerning that the level of concentration exists at 37% from nine groups.  I presume if we scaled it back a little further to the top 11, 12 or 13 companies, we would see more companies that are in the top level groups.<\/p> <p>  The report references one of the benefits of Brexit as increased foreign direct investment.  This could mean increased concentration and increased reliance in terms of the tax take.  Obviously, we are not going to turn away foreign direct investment if companies want to come to Gaoth Dobhair, Cork or wherever and invest and employ several hundred people.

It would be useful if we could compare it internationally with other small countries and see what type of concentrations they have.  However, we have been unable to find statistics.  If we are the people looking at it, the suggestion is that it is more of an issue here.  If it was an issue in other countries, we would expect those responsible to be looking at it.<\/p> <p>  We have an analytical note on the volatility of corporation tax.  It is the most volatile of the main tax heads.  The advice will remain the same.  When we look at setting sustainable fiscal policy, we should not look at windfall revenues or volatile revenues.  We are looking at setting the growth rate of expenditure at the potential long-run growth of the economy.  That puts it on a more sustainable footing.<\/p> <p>  Receipts such as corporation tax should not be feeding in to budget discussions.  If we are looking at Exchequer returns on a monthly basis and saying that corporation tax is below profile and that means we have a tighter budget, it may be problematic.  We should be moving away from that type of conversation to setting our budgetary policy on a more long-term and sustainable footing.<\/p> <p>  There is important information within the Exchequer returns and what happens to various taxes every month, but taxes in any given year being below or behind profile should not affect the budgetary policy for the following year unless there are significant issues that have underlying macroeconomic problems.  If it is simply a case of natural volatility in the receipts, then we should examine it and ask what happens with the overall pattern in the year.  We should be looking at October's budget on the basis of what we need to do in 2018 rather than what is happening to the tax receipts in 2017.  Our view is that we should move away from focusing on more short-term measures and having headlines changing based on what is coming out from month to month to a more long-term basis.<\/p> <p>  Corporation tax will remain volatile and concentrated.  It has become an important source of revenue, up to 15% of Exchequer tax receipts.  I do not believe it has ever been above that level, although it got close previously.  It is now almost at the highest level.  Contributions from previous speakers have suggested this increases our reliance on foreign direct investment and that we have employment and income tax benefits.  Now, because of various changes, many of which are international, although some are domestic, there have been increases in corporation tax payments in Ireland.

If resources are once-off or volatile and not of a recurring nature, then they should not be used.  Let us suppose the economy continues to grow strongly and part of that growth comes from the FDI sector and this feeds into our potential growth rate.  In that case it will feed in to the calculations using the expenditure benchmark, the ten-year potential growth rate.  In the long run it will form part of those, but not year to year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McGrath asked about the rainy day fund.  This is something that I and the council are in favour of.  There are significant issues over how it might operate.  We see a rainy day fund having a role to play in setting countercyclical fiscal policy.  We do not necessarily need a rainy day fund for that, but it can be an element that feeds into it to allow us to lean against the wind.  If the economy is performing strongly, as it is now, we do not have to use all the available fiscal resources.  Problems could potentially be coming down the track.  For example, in the case of Brexit some years down the line, only God knows what will happen over a five, ten or 15-year period.  If we have the capacity to build up fiscal resources now, it would be a benefit to have them in reserve.<\/p> <p>  There are operational issues.  If we make savings now, how can we ensure we can avail of them in future?  One issue with the expenditure benchmark is that if we have a certain amount of available fiscal space and we do not use it, we cannot put it in the bank, so to speak.  We cannot draw on it the following year.  The calculation is done each year on a separate basis in respect of how we can increase spending in a given year.  Under the rules at present, if we do not use it, it is as if we lose it.  The incentive is to use the available fiscal space every year.  The rules themselves are not conducive to the establishment of a countercyclical rainy day fund.<\/p><p>We were promised a paper on that from the Department of Finance and we believe work has been undertaken in that direction.

Consideration by the committee today of the role of alternative fuels and technologies in decarbonising transport is timely.  Our two Departments, namely, Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Transport, Tourism and Sport, work together on this agenda and a number of significant developments are being brought to fruition.  My colleague, Mr. Confrey, and I co-chair the task force on low emission vehicles, LEVs, which is examining a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of LEVs here.  A Programme for a Partnership Government committed to establishing the task force to enable Ireland to become leader in the uptake of LEVs.  Transport and energy collaboration on this alternative fuels agenda has also underpinned both the development of the national policy framework on alternative fuels infrastructure and the development of transport measures for inclusion in the forthcoming national mitigation plan, which is the whole-of-Government decarbonisation roadmap.<\/p> <p>  Reflecting our respective roles, we propose to share the opening statement.  I will outline the role of alternative fuels and technologies in transport emissions abatement, then will discuss briefly the national mitigation plan and finally will speak on the development of the national policy framework on alternative fuels infrastructure.  From the energy perspective, Mr. Confrey will then outline the work of the LEV task force, the role of electric vehicles and biofuels in meeting renewable energy targets and the proposed changes envisaged in the new EU clean energy package.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt about the scale of the challenge we face to achieve our national policy ambition of transition to a climate resilient low-carbon society by 2050.  That is especially challenging for the transport sector, not only in Ireland but throughout the developed world.  Our welcome return to economic growth brings with it increasing travel demand.  Ireland is back on the move, presenting the transport sector with the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an expanding sector without impeding social progress or economic recovery.  Transport is not an end in itself; it is a means for access to jobs, markets, education, health services, cultural interaction and a range of other services and amenities that contribute to healthy and fulfilling lives.<\/p> <p>  Decarbonising by 2050 will require a transformation in how we travel, how we do business and, in particular, the types of fuel and technologies we employ.  A range of complementary measures promoting lower carbon choices will also be key, such as more better-quality lower carbon public transport, more active travel and reducing the need to travel and journey distances.<\/p> <p>  The national climate change mitigation plan will set out both the challenges to meeting emissions reduction targets and a clear pathway towards Ireland's objective of transition to a low-carbon economy.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and his Department have the lead role within Government in preparing the plan.  In that, they work closely with the various key Departments including Agriculture, Food and the Marine, ourselves in Transport, Tourism and Sport, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The responsibility for emissions reduction is a collective one and Ireland's emission reduction targets are national and not sectoral in nature.  Transport will of course have to play its part.  The measures we will set out will be wide-ranging and will focus primarily on modal shift particularly to public transport in urban areas, a movement to alternatively fuelled vehicles and targeted behavioural change.<\/p><p>Major changes to our conventional fuel choices will be needed to effect this substantial reduction in overall transport emissions.  Greater use of alternative fuels and technologies offers the most feasible and cost-effective solution to tackling this greenhouse gas challenge, as well as moving us towards meeting our renewable energy targets.  In recognition of this and in support of EU-wide action to encourage the deployment of alternative fuels, Ireland&rsquo;s national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure for transport was recently published by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It represents our first step in communicating the longer term national vision, a cornerstone of which is our ambition that, by 2030, all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emissions capable.  The framework is intended to ensure access to refuelling or recharging infrastructure will not act as a barrier to the take-up of alternatively fuelled vehicles.  It will achieve this by ensuring appropriate provision of refuelling infrastructure and setting common technical standards for EU-wide interoperability.  In so doing it will provide a supportive, enabling environment for suppliers and consumers and increase confidence and reassurance in our national commitment to the emerging alternative fuels market.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2396,"content":"<p>I will briefly set out the work of the low emissions vehicle, LEV, task force.  As Ms Behan outlined, it is a commitment within the programme for Government and the task force has been established to consider the range of measures and options available to the Government to accelerate the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially electric vehicles.  It is jointly chaired and comprises a steering group and three working groups.  The work of the task force so far has been divided into two phases, with the first focusing solely on electric vehicles, both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, while the second will focus on other alternative fuels.<\/p> <p>  The first of the working groups deals with market growth stimuli and visibility and its objectives are to present a range of vehicle growth scenarios for the years 2020 to 2025, inclusive, and to examine a range of stimulus options and public leadership measures.  Infrastructure, energy regulation and pricing are the focus of the second working group which has been tasked with devising a sustainable policy framework to ensure sufficient effective and efficient electric vehicle charging and fuelling infrastructure for LEVs.  It is also considering the development of a sufficient network of refuelling points, providing an appropriate range of options for low-carbon alternatives.  The third working group is dealing with planning legislation, building regulations and public leadership.  It will examine building and planning legislation and how to facilitate charging and refuelling infrastructure and mobility for LEVs.  It will set out, for example, to ensure simple measures such as the marking of appropriate free public parking locations for LEV users are implemented via the correct channels.  Some key early findings from the task force are expected to be fed into the 2018 budgetary process later this summer.<\/p> <p>  Turning to electric vehicle targets, in 2008 the Government outlined plans of an initial target of 10% of the car fleet or approximately 230,000 cars to be electric by 2020.  In 2014, however, it was decided to revise this target downwards to better reflect the prevailing macroeconomic climate and specifically the level of EV uptake which was lower than anticipated.  Consequently, Ireland's third national energy efficiency action plan stated that approximately 50,000 electric vehicles could form part of the transport fleet in 2020.  In the light of technology and fuel price evolution, this figure has been further revised, consequent on analysis underpinning the national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure which forecast that there could be in the region of 20,000 electric vehicles in Ireland by 2020. <\/p> <p>  Apart from economic considerations, technology advancement, affordability and consumer choice are the most important levers in triggering consumers to move from petrol and diesel to electric vehicles.  Notwithstanding the substantial Exchequer support available, the reality of a halving of the price of oil and the pace of technology improvement has very significantly impacted on electric vehicle market penetration.  Nevertheless, we have seen growing numbers of electric vehicles registered in Ireland, particularly from 2015 onwards, facilitated in part by the greater choice of models available.<\/p> <p>  The electric vehicle grants scheme provides grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid and is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  The scheme is kept under constant review and will continue throughout 2017, with an allocation of &euro;5 million for that purpose.  The grants are in addition to VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 that also applies.  Budget 2017 extended VRT relief on plug-in hybrid vehicles to the end of 2018 and on battery electric vehicles to 2021.  Over 2,000 electric vehicles have been supported to date, of which over 75% have been grant-aided since 2015.  So far in 2017, just over 450 EV grants have been awarded, which represents growth of approximately 25% in sales this year. <\/p> <p>  Turning towards the 2009 renewable energy directive and specifically our renewable transport target, all member states have been set a binding target that at least 10% of their energy use in the transport sector be derived from renewable sources by 2020.  This obviously works in tandem with the overall obligation of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In common with other member states, Ireland has sought to meet its target in the transport sector primarily through the use of sustainable biofuels, alongside a contribution from electric vehicles.  The biofuels obligation scheme is the principal mechanism being deployed to meet our renewable energy target in transport by 2020.  The SEAI has calculated that 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at the end of 2015, when the weightings for double certificates were accounted for as provided for under the directive. <\/p> <p>  Biofuels have played a significant role in trying to reduce Ireland greenhouse gas emissions in the non-emissions trading scheme sector.  The introduction of the obligation scheme in 2010 has meant that road transport fuel suppliers have to ensure biofuels represent a certain percentage of national annual fuel sales.  As and from January 2017, the obligation is that for every 92 litres of fossil fuel the relevant fuel supplier has placed on the market, it must hold 8 biofuel certificates, in other words, 8% by volume.  The Department intends to publish a consultation paper later this year to examine the potential for further phased increases under the biofuels obligation scheme.  Further increases could create an increasing demand for biofuels and opportunities for their production.  Policy on biofuels has to take into account the requirements set out in the fuel quality directive and the provisions of the indirect land use change directive.<\/p> <p>  In November 2016, as part of the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, the European Commission proposed a new renewable energy directive to apply after 2020.  The provisions build on the existing directive and provide a framework for renewable energy development to 2030.  Under the proposals, food-based biofuels are to be phased out, chiefly owing to concerns about indirect land use change and other food versus fuel issues.  The role of advanced biofuels has become increasingly important and a mandatory target of 6.8% has been proposed for transport fuel suppliers to provide for an increasing share of renewable and low-carbon fuels, including advanced biofuels, renewable transport fuels of non-biological origin, waste-based fuels and renewable electricity by 2030.  The figure of 6.8% includes at least 3.6% for advanced biofuels from waste and residues.  There is no proposal to maintain the existing national binding target for transport of 10% beyond 2020, although this will be subject to negotiation between the Council and the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The most important transformation in transport will be the replacement of conventional fossil fuel vehicles on the roads.  The initial investment in alternative technologies is, admittedly, costly, but it can help Ireland to adapt more quickly to the transition away from conventional fuels.  The costs are challenging and there is obviously a need to balance constrained investment resources against other key needs.  There must be a robust assessment of the impact.  It is clear, however, that the transition to alternative fuels and technologies most effectively sets Ireland on the right path towards decarbonisation and having cleaner air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2397,"content":"<p>Transport accounts for a significant proportion of our non-emissions trading scheme, ETS, emissions.  Approximately 75% of our transport emissions comes from road transport which is dominated by passenger vehicles.  We see this as being a significant area of focus where we can really have an impact in the coming years.<\/p><p>Mr. Confrey has reflected on the targets set in 2008.  It is also worth reflecting on some militating factors which we have sensed across our energy efficiency schemes.  During the recession consumers were not making purchasing decisions at the same frequency they would previously have made them.  Thus there were fewer opportunities for us to influence their decisions and bring them towards electric vehicles.  There was not a turnover of purchases that could be influenced.  Separately, there was also a lack of choice in the market.  In 2008 and even up to 2011 there were just two vehicles available for purchase in this market, which was a constraint.<\/p><p> The grants programme commenced in 2011 and has supported the purchase of approximately 2,200 electric vehicles to date.  The figure has been increasing in the past two years and there is a recovery in train.  Approximately 670 electric vehicles have been imported directly from the United Kingdom, in addition to the 2,200.  There is an active purchasing market.  It is also worth noting that some jurisdictions such as the Netherlands only have 10% penetration of fully electric vehicles in their EV fleet, with 90% being hybrids using traditional fossil fuels alongside the battery.  Not quite the inverse but close to it is true in Ireland, as 75% of electric vehicles are fully electric, with only 25% being plug-in hybrids.  Per vehicle, there is a greater impact in that less fossil fuel will be used.  That is a positive message coming from the incentivisation scheme and an important characteristic.<\/p><p> In 2015 approximately 0.5% of car purchases in Ireland were of electric vehicles.  In the Netherlands the figure was 9.7%, a significant figure, while in Denmark it was just over 2% and in Germany, just 0.1%, one fifth of what we have achieved.  It is worth contextualising these figures.  Looking at take-up and digging more into the data, we performed a qualitative analysis just before Christmas 2016, involving electric vehicle owners, those who were considering purchasing an electric vehicle and a number of interested parties and stakeholders.  There were three key findings with approximately the same weighting as each other.  The first was that there was greater consumer awareness of and confidence in the technology.  The second concerned the retention or, perhaps, improvement of the incentives and mechanisms that addressed the price parity point, which is connected to the fact that electric vehicles still have a price premium attached to them.  The third finding concerned the importance of widespread and robust charging infrastructure to address the issue of range anxiety.  It is important to put it in place.  <\/p><p> We are developing a three-year demonstrator programme focusing on three key areas of activity geared specifically towards increasing consumer confidence and awareness.  The first part will be a trip-based car use programme analogous to the Dublin Bikes scheme which will be available in the urban environment.  The second will be an EV test drive campaign that will bring test driving to festivals, county towns, third level institutions or other large centres of enterprise and employment where people can try the vehicles.  The third is a commercial fleet trial, in which we will assist commercial enterprises, from SMEs to large industries, to plug in electric vehicles and test them against their traditional usage patterns to see what benefits they might bring.  From this demonstrator programme, we are seeking a much greater consumer insight derived from surveys, driver reports and other exercises, as well as a robust technical data set for driver behaviour, use patterns and fuel and carbon savings from cars and light goods vehicles.  <\/p><p> A number of emerging trends are worth exploring briefly.  Battery costs are generally one third of overall vehicle costs and have dropped by about 65% in the past five years.  With mainstream manufacturers also putting a lot more electric vehicles into their fleets, we anticipate that the cost will come down.  We see the price parity point being reached within five to ten years and I hope within five.  If that is the case, the need for incentivisation or grants schemes could decrease over time.  In respect of range anxiety, the improvement in the range of electric vehicles means that, at the high end, we are in the 600 km technical range.  Soon we will see an Ireland-scale battery coming into being.  This is a small country of a certain geographical extent.  If a vehicle's range can take it from one point to another, the type of charging infrastructure needed changes.  With price parity in train and the need for charging infrastructure changing, we chose to focus on the consumer awareness and confidence piece.<\/p><p> Biogas and natural gas offer lower emission alternatives to traditional fuels.  It is perhaps more likely that they will have a greater impact in the case of heavier transport vehicles.  Our recent biogas report addresses that fact in much greater detail and I invite committee members to read it.   We will continue to work independently, with the two Departments and the low emissions vehicle steering group to explore more efficient and impactful ways of reducing energy use in, and decarbonising, the transport fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2399,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon.

As part of the decision, ESB Networks was allowed to recover up to &euro;25 million through distribution use of system, DUOS, charges, which are for use of the electricity system.  Following on from this, in October 2016, the CER issued a consultation paper on the results of the pilot scheme and the associated assets, including the chargers we can see in public spaces on the side of the road.  In the consultation process views were sought on the ESB's eCars proposal on the continuing ownership of these assets.  The options proposed to the commission were that the assets become part of the regulated asset base, meaning that they would continue to be considered part of the ESB Networks system and supported and remunerated through the distribution use of system charges; that the assets be sold to a third party via public tender in a single lot or multiple lots, essentially, a disposal of the assets to another interested party or parties; and that there be continuing ESB eCars ownership and operation of the assets.  The ESB eCars proposal highlighted that while the &euro;25 million was the amount the CER allowed ESB Networks to recover through DUOS charges, there was additional expenditure of approximately &euro;6.1 million on the installation and continued operation and maintenance of the system.<\/p> <p>  The pilot project was designed to assess and report on the impact of multiple electric vehicle charging points on the distribution system.  In October 2016 the report compiled by ESB Networks as part of the project was published.  It covers elements of the CER's interaction with the electric vehicle infrastructure on the electricity side.  On the gas side, I note that in the past five years, under price control for Gas Networks Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation has allowed an &euro;8 million fund for innovative natural gas projects.  Approximately &euro;4 million of that sum was spent on compressed natural gas infrastructure.  As Mr. Gannon pointed out, the majority of the infrastructure and usage was targeted at heavy goods vehicles such as buses and trucks in the haulage sector.<\/p><p>As part of the latest price control for Gas Networks Ireland, the consultation paper on which was published on Friday, there was a proposal to allow &euro;17.5 million in the next period for similar innovation, approximately &euro;12.5 million of which Gas Networks Ireland has already earmarked for what is called the causeway project which involves 17 compressed natural gas fuelling points at strategic locations throughout the core transport infrastructure in Ireland.  This addresses the CER's role in the provision of electricity infrastructure to support electric vehicles and recent interactions we have had on the compressed natural gas fuelling points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2403,"content":"<p>I wish to share with the committee the fact that we still have a decision to make, as Mr. Melvin mentioned.  We have a consultation process and have received responses on the future particularly of electric vehicles and EV infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I wish to refer to some of the developments at European level.  The committee met in February to talk about the Clean Energy for All Europeans package.  There is a specific reference in Article 33 of the package to the treatment of electricity infrastructure for electric vehicles.  It states the European Commission does not see it as fitting in with the regulatory asset bases, as Mr. Melvin explained, and that it should only be done on a very exceptional basis.  We will have to keep this in mind.  I also refer to the transport policy issued by both Departments but particularly the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which states it should be done on a commercial basis.  This is a decision we have yet to make, but I am trying to explain to the committee and share with it our current thinking.  It was clear in the responses we had received that there was a range of views from the owners and that they clearly wanted to make sure a proper mechanism was in place for continuing to charge vehicles on a reasonable basis.  Views were split on whether the assets should form part of the asset base - clearly not foreseen at a European level - or whether ownership should be on a commercial basis by ESB eCars.  There was also a clear view from the respondents in the consultation process that there should be continuing support for the maintenance of existing assets.  We can understand why there is this view.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the CER's primary objective, as set out in legislation, it is also clear that our job is to protect the distribution system and set the cost for it.  We need to be very careful that there is no cross-subsidisation of one specific user of the electricity distribution system for the overall distribution system users.  I wish to share with the committee our current thinking, that we do not see a basis in legislation for us to continue to pay for what is a research and development project, as Mr. Melvin set out, that has achieved its objectives and the results of which have been published, but I cannot foresee our decision until we have made it.  We will work closely with the Departments to ensure as much as possible that whatever our decision is, we will not frustrate but support Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2404,"content":"<p>The ESB is represented by Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. O'Leary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#E00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2405,"content":"<p>I will cover electric vehicles from the ESB's point of view.<\/p> <p>  Climate change is a significant threat facing society.  Ireland has committed to an 80% to 95% reduction, when compared to 1990 levels, in emissions from the energy system by 2050.  For it to meet this goal which is a European Union obligation, the decarbonisation of the heat and transport sectors needs to proceed rapidly.  Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing as more and more journeys are taken by car.  Ireland needs to reduce emissions without interfering with the competitiveness of the economy.  Even at present, when using electricity generated from the current mix of fuels, electric vehicles are far more carbon-efficient than internal combustion engines and can play a huge part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  With zero tailpipe emissions, electric vehicles also reduce air pollution which is a major health issue in urban areas.  Four major capital cities - Paris, Mexico City, Madrid and Athens - are to ban diesel vehicles by 2025 for air quality reasons.  Electric vehicles, because they can use energy generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, will allow Ireland to strengthen its fuel security and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.  A further major benefit of electric vehicles is the ability to recharge at home using cheap night-rate electricity, thus cutting motoring costs.<\/p> <p>  Since 2010, the ESB has been deploying and operating Ireland's world-class national EV infrastructure.  The provision of nationwide and publicly available charging services to EV drivers is a multi-faceted task that requires the following interrelated and interdependent components: a national network of physical charge points, each having its own operating software; ensuring continuous \"always on\" telecoms connectivity to and from these charge points; a charge point management system; customer support services - for example, a call centre and online access; operations and maintenance systems and contractors to respond to and prevent outages; the provision of digital tools to provide real time charger status data for drivers; secure customer billing and payments systems; and education and marketing.  The Irish charging infrastructure of almost 1,000 charge points enables EV drivers to travel nationwide.  With a presence in almost every community with more than 1,500 inhabitants and fast charger coverage every 60 km on Ireland's main arterial routes, the network provides a highly visible signal for potential buyers of electric vehicles that they will be able to use a robust network of charging points across Ireland.  This is a necessary precursor to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  While the infrastructure roll-out was initiated by the ESB with some funding from the European Union, the bulk of support for the network, as Mr. Melvin said, has come from the Commission for Energy Regulation which supported the research and development in order to understand the long-term impact the mass adoption of electric vehicles would have on the electricity grid.  The pilot phase, as Mr. Melvin and Mr. Blaney said, was completed with the production by the ESB of a 600-page report covering both the technical and economic aspects of electric transportation.  The work detailed findings and recommendations across 43 areas, grouped into seven work packages.  The project will assist the future planning of the Irish electricity transmission and distribution networks to accommodate electric transportation.  This work has been recognised internationally as being at the cutting edge and components of it are already being referenced by the likes of the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States.  However, since completion of the pilot phase, the ESB has been funding the network's operation and maintenance from its own resources.  At the request of the CER, in late 2015 the ESB suspended the introduction of driver fees for use of the infrastructure and it remains free for users.  The future ownership and regulatory and funding model for this national EV infrastructure also remain uncertain, pending the completion of the aforementioned public consultation process.  The process closed in November 2016, but the lack of a determination on ownership is creating great uncertainty which impedes future investment plans for the network, including its operation and maintenance.  Given the limited number of electric vehicles in use in Ireland, the continued operation of the EV charging network is not viable on a commercial basis at this stage.<\/p> <p>  There are more than 4,500 battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids across Ireland, North and South, with 2,800 in the Republic.  In addition, the choice and range of electric vehicles have expanded greatly.  More than 15 EV models are now available in Ireland.  However, like any new technology, consumer acceptance takes time.  That is why Government intervention is necessary to kick-start the market.  Infrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition to drive EV uptake.  In countries that have achieved much greater uptake of electric vehicles, for example, Norway with 140,000, the United Kingdom with more than 100,000 and the Netherlands with more than 110,000, a greater range of policy incentives has been employed.  The Dutch, for example, have indicated that they will ban the sale of internal combustion engine cars in 2025.  However, these measures do not necessarily have to be particularly expensive or in place for a long time.  A three-year period with free parking while charging and free or reduced tolls coupled with an information campaign on the benefits of electric vehicles could potentially have a dramatic impact on EV sales.  These policy changes, coupled with the rapid advancement in battery and car technology, could drive a major shift in consumer behaviour.  Given that the average car journey distance in Ireland is 26.4 km per day, according to CSO figures from 2014, and the distances between cities are quite short, electric vehicles are perfectly suitable for the majority of people.<\/p> <p>  While there are a number of incentives already in place, as mentioned, to support the adoption of electric vehicles, there are a number of additional incentives which could be very helpful in increasing electric vehicle sales in Ireland and they have worked well in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>These might include free tolls on Government-owned roads - the M50, port tunnel and East Link in Dublin - either for a period of three years or until we have an EV fleet of more than 30,000 cars in Ireland; instituting a grant programme for EV home charges similar to that available in the United Kingdom; the creation of a stable regulatory and funding model to support investment in public EV infrastructure; zero emissions leading to zero road tax - there is currently reduced road tax of &euro;120 but that could be further reduced; and CO2 benefit in kind taxation for company vehicles with a reduced rate for EV as is employed in the UK.<\/p><p> ESB believes that the electrification of transport using clean indigenous energy will be a part of tackling climate change as well as meeting other societal needs.  International experience shows that the mass adoption of EVs can be achieved if appropriate supportive public policies are put in place.  However, confidence at consumer and industry level is critical.  A robust and extensive national public EV charging network is necessary but by itself will not be sufficient to achieve a long-term transformation.  Working with other stakeholders such as the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, ESB has put in place an advanced nationwide network that can provide one of the foundations for EV adoption and it is continuing to operate and provide service on this network on a short-term basis.  However, a sustainable business model that covers the costs of running the network is needed.  This will necessarily include some combination of user subscription and public funding underpinning its operations.  The current situation is not sustainable and it is critical that appropriate arrangements are put in place in a timely manner that will support investment and innovation and, in so doing, allow Ireland to maintain its pioneering position in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2407,"content":"<p>We will now move on to Gas Networks Ireland, represented by Mr. Denis O'Sullivan, head of commercial, and Mr. Daniel FitzPatrick, commercialisation manager.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#F00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2408,"content":"<p>I thank members for the opportunity to brief the committee on the work that Gas Networks Ireland is doing to decarbonise Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector, in particular in the area of commercial transport and public service vehicles.  Gas Networks Ireland is creating a new transport network in Ireland in the form of a 70-station network for refuelling compressed natural gas, CNG, vehicles to meet the needs of Ireland&rsquo;s public and private commercial transport operators.  <\/p> <p>  As members know, natural gas is the cleanest of fossil fuels.  In the context of transport, a CNG vehicle produces 22% less CO2, 70% less nitrogen oxide, 80% less sulphur dioxide and 99% less particulate matter and operates much more quietly than the diesel equivalent.  Natural gas is used in over 2 million vehicles in Europe, comprising mainly commercial vehicles.  The fuel is used in the form of compressed natural gas or CNG as it is more commonly known.  While Ireland does not have an established history of using CNG, this technology is well established around the world.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transport targets, the main efforts to date have been in relation to biofuels and EVs.  The biofuel obligation scheme has played a major role in the progress that has been made on our 2020 targets.  While progress on EVs has been slower than some would have hoped, the work done by our colleagues in the ESB will yield significant dividends in the years to come for the private car market.  Gas Networks Ireland is focusing its efforts on larger vehicles such as light and heavy goods vehicles and public transport.  These vehicles generally operate for long periods, carry heavy loads and have a high operating range, making them particularly suited to CNG.  While they make up just 3% of the total number of vehicles on the road, they account for 20% of emissions.  By concentrating our efforts on changing the habits of this relatively small group of decision makers, we can have a very significant impact on our overall aim of decarbonising our transport sector.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned at the outset, Gas Networks Ireland is currently developing a network of CNG filling stations across Ireland.  The network of 70 stations will comprise both public and private filling stations.  The first public station will open in Dublin Port this summer, with the backbone of the network rolling out in the next three years.  The first private refuelling point has recently become operational at Clean Ireland Recycling, a waste management company in Shannon, County Clare.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to building the network infrastructure, Gas Networks Ireland, with support from the Innovation and Network Executive Agency, INEA, through the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, has opened a funding initiative to fill the relatively small gap in cost that still exists between conventional and CNG vehicles.  The initiative is proving extremely popular and the first CNG-powered vehicles have arrived in Ireland and are operational.<\/p> <p>  I have outlined the significant environmental savings of CNG vehicles.   These benefits will be further improved with the arrival of renewable gas.  Gas Networks Ireland is currently working with a number of partners to bring renewable gas into the Irish network in early 2018.  Renewable gas, which is generated from feedstocks such as food waste, agricultural waste and grass, is identical in composition to natural gas but is completely renewable and carbon neutral and requires no modification to the network or downstream equipment.  Gas Networks Ireland is targeting 20% renewable gas on the Irish system by 2030, a figure supported by a recent SEAI report which indicated a potential for 25% of gas on the Irish system to be renewable by 2030.<\/p> <p>  It is important, from a business perspective, to note that the benefits of CNG are not solely environmental ones.  CNG offers a significant fuel cost saving over diesel.  Based on today&rsquo;s diesel prices, CNG offers a 40% reduction in fuel cost.  In the highly competitive world in which our exporters operate, in particular in the current climate, reducing logistics costs is a very attractive proposition.  In terms of performance, leading manufacturers such as Iveco and Scania have invested heavily in creating a new generation of vehicles which offer even greater performance than before.  The modern CNG vehicle offers a direct competitive challenge to its diesel alternatives in terms of cost, performance, range and maintenance.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the recent publication by the Department of the national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure for transport in Ireland which focuses on decarbonising transport in Ireland.  As noted in the framework, CNG, unlike other options considered, is a mature and proven technology for public transport.  When taken with the imminent introduction of renewable gas, it is the logical and obvious choice for Ireland&rsquo;s bus networks.  CNG buses are commonplace in cities throughout the world.  Gas Networks Ireland and Bus &Eacute;ireann have already successfully trialled CNG buses in Cork and we look forward to engaging with the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to deliver the next generation of Ireland's public transport fleet.<\/p> <p>  CNG is a technology that has been adopted across the world for many years.  Ireland is a little late on the uptake.  However, in doing so we have the benefit of adopting a mature technology at competitive cost.  I thank the committee for its ongoing interest and efforts to drive forward the sustainability agenda in Ireland.  I am happy to take questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2409,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, represented by Mr. Alan Nolan, Mr. Brian Cooke and Mr. Tom Cullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#F00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2410,"content":"<p>SIMI and the motor industry it represents strongly support the development of considered and balanced environmental strategies that can help deliver lower CO2, better air quality and more sustainable transport.  It is worth underlining that this is a crucial project for our industry because, for us, a sustainable future is the only future for transport.  As the potential deliverers of technological solutions and, beyond the technological aspect of our role, our understanding of consumer behaviour and the potential impact of fiscal and other measures on vehicle purchase or usage decisions should be of assistance in the development of strategies that can deliver the desired results while reducing the potential for damaging or unhelpful unintended consequences of strategies developed.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes we beat ourselves up that we are bad at things.  However, the 2008 VRTN road tax changes focused solely on CO2.  In many ways, we should see that as a success in its prompting successfully engaged consumers to make very much better environmental choices in buying their cars, thus delivering a huge reduction in the average CO2 per car on the road from 167 grammes per kilometre in 2007 to 112 grammes per kilometre in 2016.  We have made a great start and, rather than seeing it as a failure because the only focus was CO2 rather than NOx and particulates, we should consider building on that achievement and learning from and tweaking it to deliver in the future in other areas.  That has been more successful than similar schemes in many other countries in Europe.<\/p><p> Much of the focus going forward will be on alternative fuels and the SIMI has always proposed supporting the widest range of technology.  It is good to hear of different technologies because we do not know which options will deliver the best solutions in the various areas.  We need to keep a wide view of the technologies that could serve us well.  Electric vehicles and hybrids are an important stepping stone to full electric vehicles while hydrogen fuel cell and compressed and liquid natural gas, leading to compressed biogas, have made huge progress in Italy in the area of passenger cars as well as goods vehicles.  They may be worth looking at.  They are based on proven diesel technology and we have a lot of diesel cars in Ireland so there would not be any great change.<\/p><p> The roll-out of fully electric cars has been slow, though the State and other stakeholders have put a huge amount into it in the form of advertising, setting up dealerships and technology, etc.  Some 2,200 fully electric cars have been registered, including this year's cars, and there are 17,500 hybrid cars, close to 1% of the fleet.  We have a huge amount of work to do to deliver our objective.  So far this year, 559 fully electric cars have been registered, which is a tiny number but represents some progress compared to 454 for the whole of last year, though some are used, imported electric cars.  We are significantly ahead of last year but the numbers are still very poor.<\/p><p> We are at a particularly important point where we need to push this a big step forward.  We are very close and we can take advantage of the CO2 taxation provisions, which show that consumers react when there are incentives to go in a certain direction.  Consumers are far more accepting of the electric car as a solution to their normal driving needs than in the past and we should look at the experience of countries which have had success in adding significant numbers of electric cars to their fleets.  One message we get is that no one single measure works in isolation.<\/p><p> Norway has been the most successful country, delivering 23.5% of new car sales in 2016, and we would love to see such numbers.  It delivered 37% in the month of January 2017 and is making huge strides.  Although Norway is a very wealthy country with significant oil revenues to invest in this strategy, nobody in Ireland would say the incentives from Government were the problem.  We need to understand consumers and why they make choices.  It is clearly about identifying both the strengths of electric cars, which are that they are environmental, have cost benefits and are an enjoyable driving experience.  There are, however, potential resistance factors such as anxieties on range, future value, replacement battery cost and potential obsolescence.  These may not all be real but they have to looked at as resistors.  We should seek to increase the perceived value proposition for the consumer relative to the cost of the car through a mix of fiscal and softer incentives from urban authorities to make the offering very attractive.<\/p><p> The role of supportive local authorities cannot be overstated for without their support in relation to free parking, free tolls, access to restricted traffic areas and the use of bus lanes, where possible and appropriate, electric vehicles, EVs, would not have seen the rate of growth that they have experienced in Norway, where they are seen as a smart choice.  In our more detailed submission we have outlined a range of measures, some fiscal but many soft incentives which are not too costly.  We agree with the support measures outlined by the ESB as we do the carsharing scheme for EVs.  It is important to have landmark or marquee projects to give a bit of excitement and interest, such as zero benefit-in-kind for an electric company car, similar to the provision for the carsharing scheme.  This would get people really interested and would help normalise the electric car in the marketplace.<\/p><p> We are very excited about his project but this is about decarbonisation of the fleet.  We also need to keep an eye on the day job, so to speak, of the rest of the fleet, which comprises 2 million cars.  This year we will register some 130,000 new cars, 6% of the fleet.  It would take approximately 16 years to replace the whole fleet and some of the cars would be 16 years old at that time.  If we increase the current level of electric vehicle registrations 100-fold, it would take 38 years to replace all the cars in the fleet.  We should not give up on this just because it is difficult but we need to see the size of the problem.  We need to watch the rest of the vehicle fleet while we are moving.  It will go faster but decarbonising means continuing to replace the worst offending vehicles on the road while we carry on with our project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2412,"content":"<p>I speak as a practical user of the end result of all the technical offerings from the experts.  Professor King of the University of Aston delivered a lecture in the Mansion House in 2011 under the auspices of the EPA in which she said everything counted.  Some 70% of CO2 emissions are from cars and light vans, and not from trucks.  There is a huge difference between what can be achieved in the case of urban trucks as distinct from long-distance trucks.  Long-distance trucks are responsible for 90% of Ireland's exports and it is extremely important that nothing is done to increase the cost base for them by adding in unrealistic options.  I am not a technician but I have an issue with the difference between LNG and compressed natural gas, CNG, which has a much shorter range in a truck than LNG.  Refuelling stations for gas in the UK are LNG so, while CNG would work extremely well in the local urban environment and over some longer distances within Ireland, it will not work on other longer distances.<\/p> <p>  We see the urban environment being used for the alternatives that are available.  I learned to drive in a 1916 electric bread van.  Where have they gone?  We have been required since 2014 to buy Euro 6 trucks and when I first got them the only thing that concerned us were the technical difficulties, such as the increased running costs etc.  However, we have learned that they have huge amounts of technology on board that can be used extremely usefully, as long as the driver is made aware of them and trained accordingly.  We have talked to the RSA about this and the European Commission is now talking about requiring all HGV drivers to have a HGV driver's certificate of professional competence, CPC.  The current course is almost irrelevant but there is talk of drivers being trained in the new technology.  Most of the owners of Euro 6 trucks are oblivious to what is available on board and it takes some time to learn it.  Indeed, local dealers usually do not know what is on board these trucks coming from Sweden or wherever they are made.<\/p> <p>  We use a SEAI-sponsored course to train our drivers at a company in Dublin.  The SEAI pays for it and has run these courses before.  I have sent information to the committee on the training available to drivers and the results that can be achieved, which are quite significant.<\/p><p>There is a 15% to 20% fuel gain available if the technology is used correctly.  <br\/><br\/>It is extremely important that there is a broader spread and the RSA has a significant role to play in terms of driver training.  Indeed, all of us in the industry have a significant role to play in that regard.  I have forwarded a paper to the committee secretariat from the <i>Financial Times<\/i>on the state of the market in Norway for electric vehicles and hybrids.  It is an extremely important read for this committee in terms of understanding what is happening there, particularly with regard to the huge financial incentives being provided for electric vehicles.  The market is very divided on the end results but Norway is way ahead of us.<br\/><br\/>Finally, most of our trucks were running on rape seed oil, an Irish produced, natural biofuel.  As the charts I have provided show, rape seed oil is one of the lowest sources of emissions.  We moved to rape seed oil under an initiative begun by the former Minister Noel Dempsey, namely the Motor Oil Tax Relief, MOTR, schemes, known as MOTR 1 and MOTR 2.  We converted 60% of our trucks to run on Irish rape seed oil but that was finished completely in the 2008 budget.  We are overlooking opportunities that are available in Ireland for an Irish-grown fuel that has every reason to be supported into the future.  I am not sure if it will work in the newer trucks but there are lots of older trucks in Ireland that could be running on it.  As Professor King said earlier, everything counts.  The targets that this country and Europe must meet are serious and it will take enormous effort.  <br\/><br\/>What has been omitted completely in all of the discussions is effective traffic management.  That does not exist in Ireland.  We have a hodge-podge of different people doing different things.  The most basic point about traffic light systems is that they increase pollution.  Ineffective systems increase the level of pollution.  There is an onus on the local authorities to ensure that the introduction of any traffic management system is preceded by an environmental impact study.  Further, before we decide to ban this or promote that, a proper impact study must be done if we are to really reduce our emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Kiersey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2414,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We explain to the general public what it is like to use electric vehicles and try to assuage their fears.  We try to explain what is happening with electric vehicles in Ireland and our experience of them.  Given Ireland's desire to meet its climate change obligations and the important part that transport plays in emissions, it is clear that Ireland needs to aggressively promote and encourage electric vehicles, especially battery electric vehicles.  While hybrids have their place, they are a transition technology.  Eventually, we are all going to move to fully electric vehicles.  <\/p> <p>  There are just over 2,000 elective vehicles on the State's roads at present but given that the target is 20,000, we have lot of work to do.  Previous speakers have referred to incentives that have been provided in other countries, particularly in Norway, which worked.  In Ireland, incentives are clearly necessary to encourage growth in electric vehicle use.  The current incentives to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles are a key decider for a lot of people.  The grant that is given towards the purchase price is good and the installation of the home chargers by the ESB is also important  They both need to be continued for a substantial amount of time.  Current incentives such as free or low-cost charging should be guaranteed for a defined period.  I know that the ESB said earlier that at some point vehicle charging will have to be commercialised.  Two or three years ago it was going to commercialise it with a price structure that would have destroyed sales of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The cost would have been roughly the same as diesel.  At the moment there are lots of disincentives to driving electric vehicles, including range anxiety and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  We have had a lot of problems in recent years in terms driving electric vehicles.  The infrastructure took its time to develop.  I purchased my car in 2012 and to get from point A to point B, if point B was a long way away, required a lot of planning.  Long journeys were difficult enough but that situation has improved a lot.  One can get around most of the country relatively easily now.  The infrastructure, broadly speaking, does work.  It is new technology but broadly speaking, it works.  The biggest problem we had was with parking spaces but SI 325 allows local authorities to designate electric vehicle charging areas.  Not all local authorities have fully adopted that but it is fundamentally important.  I presume most members of the committee do not drive electric vehicles so I ask them to imagine arriving at a petrol station to find a car parked in front of the petrol pump, blocking access to the fuel.  How happy would they be about that?  That was the situation we faced for a number of years and it was quite frustrating.  It is not the situation now.  In most counties, one can be certain of one's ability to charge one's vehicle now.  <\/p> <p>  The association believes that incentives will be necessary for a number of years.  Consideration should be given to a reduction in benefit-in-kind, BIK, for company electric vehicles and there should be grant aid to encourage the installation of chargers in business premises.  Norway, which was mentioned by others, has had the most effective conversion to electric vehicles which it achieved through various incentives.  There were practically no purchase taxes or VAT on electric vehicles for a defined period.  In Ireland consideration should be given to fiscal prudence in removing as many purchase taxes as possible to promote electric vehicle use.  Incentives are never in place permanently - they are usually in place for a defined period.  We need that at the moment to really kick start electric vehicles.  Mention was made of the increase in numbers of electric vehicles this year.  We can see that on the road.  The economy is getting a little bit better and people are more inclined to make the slightly more expensive purchase of an electric car but we would emphasise the importance of continuing with the incentives for a period of time.  <\/p> <p>  The question of the use of bus lanes is controversial but that certainly worked in Norway.  In Norway, the incentives have been so successful that they have started to remove some of them.  They really worked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Barr"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2416,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Barr to wrap up as we are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#H00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2417,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. McCabe to finish up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Barr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2418,"content":"<p>I would like to address the public charging infrastructure, particularly the process in which the CER is involved.  The feedback from drivers of electric vehicles is that while they appreciate the public charger network as it currently stands, there are significant issues in terms of reliability.  There are significant single points of failure, that is, one charger in one location.  There is also evidence of significant queuing in Dublin because of the arrival of a large number of second hand electric vehicles.  The public charging infrastructure needs to be viewed as a strategic asset in the adoption of electric vehicles and not simply a method of creating another fuelling network.  We have to look beyond the provision of electricity as somehow an alternative to diesel.  The idea is to get electric vehicles on the road.  How we fuel them and how we make money from that is really not relevant in terms of getting there.  There will be no charging infrastructure if there are no electric vehicles.  Sometimes we forget that the charging infrastructure does not stand on its own two feet.<\/p> <p>  Our association does not approve of the unregulated transfer of the public charging network to the ESB.  It accepts that the ESB is a competent body to manage the charging network but it does not agree with any unregulated transfer.  It does not agree, for example, with the decision to charge for electricity at these chargers by way of time or access.  Imagine if one paid for fuel on the basis of the duration spent in front of the pump rather than how much fuel one received.<\/p><p>It is a theme for both parties, ESB and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, that electricity should be charged by access or by time, which differentiates against different forms of EV drivers.  We make the point strongly that this is a national asset.  Unlike other countries where the networks have been developed as a combination of commercial and <i>ad hoc <\/i>relationships from state-funded systems, Ireland is unique in the fact it has a single entity network, one smart card to access all charges.  In France, one needs six smart cards and in England, one needs three smart cards and one must put money into each of those accounts.  It is an absolute mess.  In fact, in the UK, Ecotricity is re-evaluating its charging systems.  We cannot look around us and simply say it is being done here, there and everywhere, Ireland has a larger proportion of battery electrical vehicles over hybrids and that is purely down to the fact that the incentives are low running costs.  It is not a purchase incentive, because second-hand vehicles have been imported into the State in significant numbers which do not entitle the buyer to benefit from the purchase incentives but they benefit from the low running costs, that is night rate electricity and at current free charging at public chargers.  We would say there is a place for the commercialisation of public chargers.  No driver expects to get his or her electricity for nothing but we would see there is a time and place for commercialisation.  We would have seen that the abortive attempt by ESB to introduce a charging regime in 2015, which would have made electricity dearer than diesel had an enormous effect, if one views the sales of EVs in that month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2420,"content":"<p>There is a phone interfering with the sound system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#J00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2421,"content":"<p>We would encourage both the State and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to view the network as purely an incentive for the adoption of EVs.

We have to look at what our goal is, which is to increase the number of electric vehicles.  We will then worry about how we make some money from the electricity that might go into them.  There are other ways to recover charges for car usage, including road pricing and other methods that can be used.

I know CER is still considering that but when will a decision be made as it would create more certainty for customers who currently have electric vehicles.

Some 16 out of the 19 available EVs or plug-in hybrid vehicles are above that price point.

We may be a bit guilty of cramming too many groups of witnesses into this session and we might reflect on this because there has been a great deal of information imparted and perhaps we should have had an opportunity to hear the witnesses over a longer period of time and go into more detail with them.<\/p><p>The reason we are discussing this issue is that we are all aware of Ireland's commitments under the 2020 targets that must be achieved.  While we pride ourselves, to some extent, on what we have done with electricity generation, we are way behind on transport and home heat.  Various speakers have spoken about the expectation we had for electric vehicles at the start.  We are probably at about 1% of where we had intended to be when we started.  All of us around the table, the witnesses and politicians, have failed abysmally to make any meaningful impact on achieving climate change targets in the transport sector.<\/p><p>What we need is a phenomenal level of disruption in the cosiness that we have all effectively been part of.  It is very clear to me as I listen to all the witnesses, who are very well briefed in their own areas and undoubtedly working very hard from their own perspective, that nobody is in charge.  There is no central driver of this.  This is not reflective of Mr. Confrey from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or Ms Bean from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as I have seen it when I have tried to question the line Minister with responsibility for the area I shadow, the Minister for Communication, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  When I challenge him, as I do on a regular basis, about our targets in this area, his response is that it is not all his problem, that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is involved as well.  When I ask him whether the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is the lead Department, he says it is not.  There is no lead Department, or Minister who is taking the lead.  There is no driver to make this happen.  If we have learned anything from today's exercise, it is just that.  There is nobody in charge, or effectively driving the car, the bus or the truck, but all the groups are doing great work in their own area.<\/p><p>The argument on who will own the infrastructure does not really matter right now.  We are way behind on our target.<b><\/b>Somebody should be working in the background on those issues, but we need somebody at Government level who has a clear goal and will develop a strategy that will ultimately make that happen.  If we think we can go from our present position, which is 1% of what we really wanted to reach to the target of 230,000 vehicles in 2030, versus 2020, there is not a hope in hell with the slow level of progress.  It will demand far more than incentives.  It is about getting the mindset to change.  The vehicles are coming on stream and the marketplace is developing but we are still way behind.  We have an opportunity to catch up if we can get a coherent voice from Government.<\/p><p>It will take money and investment by the State but I still get the sense that the dead hand of the Department of Finance will be very slow to give up the level of moneys that come from vehicle registration tax and other taxes.  It is the cash cow and bears a resemblance to the tobacco industry.  It is very slow to move away from that influx of cash.  We have to find other ways to raise cash if we are to move consumers to a point where they are prepared to make that shift.  Anxiety about the range of the electric vehicles will disappear if one makes it worthwhile for the consumer.  All the issues the witnesses have raised will fade away very quickly if it makes financial sense to the hard-pressed commuter.  The only way we can do that is to introduce incentives that are not comparable with diesel or petrol but will make the initial stages of the lifespan of car really competitive.  If one makes it 15% to 20% cheaper to drive an electric vehicle for five years, one will shift the dial.  One will get consumers to buy into the electric vehicle.  Irish consumers are very good at understanding value.  We have seen it in the retail sector - for example, in the grocery sector with Lidl and Aldi.  People will go to stores when the price is right.<\/p><p>It is important we move towards having a single Department with responsibility for this area, which I am sure would make the lives of all of the witnesses here today, and others, a lot easier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#J00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2425,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that in terms of witnesses we are a little overloaded today but it is good to have everybody involved in this area here at the same time.  I agree also that there is a need for greater ambition and leadership.  Currently, there is a lot of passing the parcel and little focus on the issue.<\/p> <p>  Some 37% of our CO2 emissions come from the transport sector and we have a lot of catching up to do.  We have had an industrial revolution and a few other revolutions in this country but if we are to achieve our targets in this area, we need a revolution in the energy and transport areas.  In 2008, the then Government target was to have 10% of all vehicles in the transport fleet powered by electricity by 2020.  If I am correct, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was the Minister at that point.  It is good to set targets.  However, as outlined earlier, the Department's targets have changed and the target now is to have 20,000 vehicles powered by electricity by 2020.  I do not think that target will be achieved.  At the current rate of progress, it would take us 3,800 years to replace the fleet with electric vehicles.  We need to get into revolution gear in this area.  What other measures are being considered by the Department to accelerate this process?  As stated, to date only 1,942 vehicles have been purchased under the electric grants scheme.  What is the total number of charging points available?  This is a great scheme and I compliment all those involved in it.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to the ESB, everything has to be paid for by someone.  I can see the need for the roll-out of free schemes but, at the end of the day, the ESB is a commercial company.  How does it see this scheme panning out into the future?  Will the charging network be self-funded or will it be funded from another source?  As for the generation of electricity from fossil fuel sources, if I choose to charge my car at a charging point in Portlaoise or even at home, will that electricity be generated to an increasing extent from dirty fossil fuels such as coal, oil and so on?<\/p> <p> Perhaps the departmental officials will outline the implications for land use.  We have a growing world population, although that is being beaten by Japan, which has turned things around the other way.  There is huge pressure on land use in terms of population growth and increased demand for food in the developing world.  What are the implications in this regard in terms of land use?  In the context of Harvest 2020 and the many other targets being used to encourage farmers to increase production, what are the implications for land use?  There is not that much wasted land across the country.  Farmers are ploughing up to ditches these days and there is little head land remaining.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#K00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2426,"content":"<p>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Dooley said.  I believe we should concentrate on the electric vehicle issue.  While there are also big issues in the gas network and biofuels areas, we need to concentrate our focus in this regard.  Deputy Dooley is correct that there is no one in charge.  This is incredible at a time when other countries are ramping up ambition.  The German target is to have 1 million electric vehicles by 2020.  It proposes to invest &euro;500 million in its network.  As we heard, Holland proposes to ban combustion engines by 2025.  We are faffing around and decreasing our targets.  We have already lowered the target from 200,000 to 50,000 and last week it was announced that this is to be reduced further to 20,000.  The problem is not only that there is nobody in charge but that there is no ambition.  We need to have another meeting with the CER and the Department because official government needs to answer for this.  The reason we set high ambitious targets in 2008 is because there is a public good involved.  Every year 3,000 people die prematurely because of air pollution.  This is one of the ways we can save lives.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the consumer, there is a massive saving to the consumer in terms of lower maintenance charges.  Electric vehicles are better and cheaper to maintain.  We can save our consumers money by promoting electric vehicles.  We import &euro;6 billion of fossil fuel.  If we go gang-busters on electric vehicles, we can cut back a good chunk of that.  When setting the target in 2008 we were asked why it was being set at 10%.  We worked out at that time that if we shaved off 10% of the electricity demand cycle by 400 megawatts at peak we could back-fill the trough by 400 million.  That is worth billions of euro to this country and it is use of our own natural resources.  There is public good if we deliver on this ambition.  There is no reason we cannot do it.  We need to be as ambitious as Norway.  We are not that different to the Norwegians or Northern Ireland, where there are almost as many electric vehicles as in the South.  This is not a behavioural issue.  We are not different human beings.  We need ambition.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman that if we do not get an answer today on when a decision will be made on the charges issue then we will have to come back to this issue.  That decision must be taken from the viewpoint that this is a public good.  There is huge public gain involved.  This should not be viewed as a commercial investment for five years.  The ESB research and investment should be increased from &euro;25 million to &euro;250 million and the decision on commercial application should be postponed.  The &euro;250 million investment will result in savings on imported fuel bills.  We will also have better air quality and lives will be saved.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of carbon emissions, our national climate change strategy is in tatters and in disgrace because we do not have the solutions that can deliver low carbon.  We now have a viable solution in terms of the stance of motor companies and other countries on this issue.  We need decisions at Department and regulatory level to ensure quick action and action of scale.  We need a massive increase in ambition and, as stated by Deputy Dooley, we need someone to take charge.  This committee has a job to represent the pioneering drivers in this area and to help them to overcome the difficulties they have.  The key is in the regulatory decisions.  I do not think the European Union will block us but we can discuss with the European Parliament representatives when we meet them next Friday what is allowed for under the winter package.  I cannot believe that the European Commission or the new directive will block us if we are willing to make innovative regulatory decisions.  We need to start making decisions.  We need to start making investments and we need to have ambition.  We need to reverse the decision made last week to reduce the target from 50,000 to 20,000 and we need to start doing what other countries are doing, such as impose a ban on combustion engines by 2025, as is being done by the Dutch.  We would be the beneficiaries of this, with a renewable resource that needs this sort of balancing use of demand.  It is a perfect fit for this country.  We started well.  The ESB was one of the leading companies in this area but that was on the back of leadership five or six years ago.  In the absence of that leadership in the past five years we have fallen behind.  We need to catch up again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#K00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2427,"content":"<p>There are many questions for the witnesses.

Electric vehicles draw on the resources of the electricity system on the demand and storage sides.  It is important for us to try to get that value from the point of view of the electricity system.  I am the chair of a European working group that is looking at the future of distribution systems.  A wide range of European regulators, including those from Norway and Denmark, are represented on that committee.  We need to be very clear about the role of the regulator.  As an electricity regulator, the CER regulates the electricity system.  The CER is not a transport regulator and does not regulate the transport system.<\/p><p> We have spoken to our Norwegian and Danish colleagues about best practice.  It is interesting that a change in some of the incentives in Denmark has had an effect on the take-up of electric vehicles there.  The key mechanisms that are driving this at European level are State and local government funding.  They are the primary vehicles being used across the rest of Europe.  I do not want to make a comment on that other than to say that from a regulatory point of view, we are limited in statute in what we can do to provide supports in this area and we are limited in legislation, including European legislation, in how far we can go to impose this as a cost on all the electricity users across the system.  There is a view right across Europe - this is a key part of the legislation - that the market is good at coming up with clever ideas and finding solutions in new innovative areas, but such initiatives do not necessarily come from the natural monopolies, which are the network companies.  We will try to incentivise the network companies to think clearly ahead, to look at research and development processes and to understand the implications for the network.  We have to be careful about using that as the primary driver for supporting electric vehicles in any new area of the transport sector.  We are picking this message up from our colleagues across Europe as well.  I will be happy to share with the committee the knowledge we are picking up at European level.  We will try to make a decision in conjunction with the Departments in order that there is as much joined-up thinking as possible across regulation and policy matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2430,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Behan or Mr. Confrey from the Department to respond to the questions that were asked about the number of charging points and the measures that might be taken to increase the number of electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#L00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2431,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Dooley's question about who is in charge by explaining the architecture of the national climate mitigation policy.

Every sector within the Government will have to play its part in the effort to reach our national mitigation targets.  The four key sectors in this regard are transport, agriculture, power generation and the built environment.  The transport sector undoubtedly recognises that it needs to play a significant role by reducing transport emissions in order to contribute to the overall emissions reduction effort, which is a whole-of-Government effort.

I have mentioned the biofuels obligation scheme, which contributed significantly to the reduction in emissions.  I have also referred to the introduction at EU level of new vehicle emissions standards, which were doubled down on by the Government through the VRT and motor tax mechanisms.  This has resulted in a significant improvement in fuel economy and significant reductions in emissions from private cars.  I accept that transport emissions are increasing again.  This is happening because of the growth in our economy and the increase in the number of jobs.  As I have said, we need to redouble our efforts to ensure we can return to the emissions-reducing policies that have worked in the past.  Alternative fuels and technologies will provide the most cost-effective pathway for us to reduce our transport emissions between now and 2030 to the extent that is needed.  For that reason, the Government is conscious of the need to consider in a timely manner how to increase the take-up of low-emitting vehicles within HGV and passenger car fleets.  That is why the light electric vehicle task force, which is working extremely hard, has been established.  Most of the stakeholders that are represented at this afternoon's meeting are involved in and are contributing to the task force.  A number of work programmes are ongoing within the task force.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the kinds of incentives that are being considered.  I chair the first working group, which is looking at how the limited investment resources that are available to us might be deployed in this sector.  Unfortunately, we do not have Norwegian resources available to us.  We recognise that the Government can put softer and more cost-effective incentives and regulatory frameworks in place to try to secure a faster uptake of electric vehicles and other low-emitting vehicles than would otherwise be the case.  It is true that these technologies will inevitably enter the worldwide system anyway.  We have to consider timing issues like the extent to which we want to resource the earlier take-up of this form of transport than would otherwise be the case.  While Ireland has limited resources, there is no doubt that we can consider more initiatives, such as putting better incentives in place.

They are divided among all Twenty-six Counties.  There are approximately 80 new-model DC chargers, which are really fast, and approximately 720 standard chargers.  It costs approximately &euro;50,000 to install a fast charger and approximately &euro;10,000 to install a standard charger.  To date, the ESB has spent between &euro;12 million and &euro;13 million nationally on the installation of the physical infrastructure on the ground.  That accounts for some of the money that was referred to earlier by the CER.  It is not our intention to expand the national electric vehicle infrastructure network any further until there is some clarity regarding the future role of the ESB in this regard.  The ownership model will have to be decided on by the CER.<\/p> <p>  When the e-car project was started in 2010, the Government of the time estimated that the ESB and the car manufacturers would require approximately &euro;25 million to install and roll out a national electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  Approximately a year ago, the ESB finished its programme of providing not just the charging infrastructure, but also the ICT computer systems required to ensure the drivers of electric vehicles know whether every charging point in the country is working or is in use at any particular point in time and the proper billing systems linking to the supply companies.  The ESB estimates that the total cost of doing all of this was &euro;31.5 million.  Given that this end-to-end national infrastructure is as good as, if not better than, what has been done in most other European jurisdictions, we feel it was good value for money.  There is a difference of &euro;6.1 million between the original &euro;25 million we received from the CER and the costs we have incurred in rolling out the infrastructure.  We believe it costs between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million to run the electric vehicle system each year.  This includes the replacement of very old chargers that were made by companies that are no longer in existence.  When the ESB did this work in 2011 or 2012, it was pioneering stuff.<\/p><p>We would be willing to do that on a pass through basis for a number of years until there was between 25,000 and 30,000 vehicles in the country.  If there was an agreement that the timing was right between the various Departments, the IEVOA, car manufacturers and so on - a costing mechanism would have to be introduced at some stage - the ESB at that point of time would run it on a commercial basis from then on.  We have received the &euro;25 million in funding agreed initially.  There was a shortfall of just over &euro;6 million, which has been covered by ESB, which is being considered at the present time, and then it will cost &euro;X million per year to keep the system going to everybody's advantage until the company can commercialise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulvaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2439,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Dooley's comment.

We were told by the ESB on occasion that some local authorities wanted money before they would allow chargers to be installed in their area.  They saw this on a completely different basis from everybody else.  There is a huge resistance in some councils, particularly in Dublin, to give over parking spaces for EVs because of the revenue they will lose if these bays are unoccupied some of the time.  The joined-up thinking is not there but it needs to be there.<\/p> <p>  The infrastructure is super in some places.

There is a danger in looking for a silver bullet and suggesting that suddenly switching to a stronger offering for electric cars would solve the problem.  It is a slow process.  Norway, the most successful country, reached 100,000 electric cars this year.  In no year have 100,000 been sold and Norway has 2.6 million cars on the road.  If it was to reach 100,000 a year, it would take 25 years to replace them all.  One would hope it would ramp up over a period.  Even stopping the sale of internal combustion cars will still mean having a fleet of older cars that will continue to grow older.<\/p> <p>  We have had a focus on CO2 in the past.  CO2 is still a very big issue environmentally.  We have an average age of diesel cars in Ireland of 5.6 years.  In Norway, the average age is 10.6 years, which is pre-diesel particle filters.  We are talking about health and all the rest of it.  We need to take a wider view of the issue.  We would be very happy with the idea that one could replace all the cars involved by 2025.  That would give us a new car market of approximately 300,000 per year and our institute would be really happy with that.<\/p> <p>  Realistically, we need to look at the whole problem and come up with considered solutions that will actually deliver rather than just being seen to be doing things.  We have had targets in the past, such as 10% off the cars on the road or whatever it might be.  Targets based on hope rather than on a realistic appraisal of what is possible will always disappoint.  Hope is not a strategy.  We face a huge challenge and we need to get all the stakeholders involved in order to see how we might drive it forward.

The relevant authorities need to bring in the stakeholders and say, \"This is what we're going to do, chaps.\"  That is what is missing.  We have had efforts by individual bodies, the CER, the ESB, with its engineering prowess, and other interested entities, to try to get this project off the ground.  It is happening, but at a snail's pace.<\/p> <p>  We can forget about the past.  The adoption of EVs is really only beginning now because consumers this year are being presented with realistic choices in cars.  The Tesla model 3 to be introduced next year will set a price point that will really challenge manufacturers and keep prices down for EVs.  Tesla will act as a price cap for manufacturers such as Nissan and Hyundai which will have to stay below that price point.  The market will begin to sort the price point issue.  We need to ensure running costs are kept very low so that users can see a distinct advantage.  Money talks.  However, the State must take a role.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is unique in Europe.  It is small; one only has to drive 300 km before ending up in the sea.  Therefore, a huge battery is not needed.  Range anxiety in this country will not be an issue within the next two years.

The public charging network is significant.  It is a place where EV drivers meet the infrastructure.  It is very important.  We have 80 fast DC chargers.  Some of them are correctly positioned in motorway service stations and various places along our transport arteries.  However, some are incorrectly positioned in shopping centres where they get abused by people who go shopping while they charge their car when a car only takes 20 minutes to recharge.  The standard charge points are known by users as slow charging points.  The vast majority of modern EVs use DC charging and many cannot adequately utilise the power available from the standard charge point.  The Nissan Leaf only draws one third of the available power and the Hyundai Ioniq only draws about half of the available power from those points.  That is unlikely to change because manufacturers are shifting to DC charging.  The emphasis in the future will undoubtedly be on DC charging and AC charging will probably take place in the home and in what we call destination charging, which is in hotels and places where people leave their cars for long periods.  Many of our standard chargers are in the wrong places.  We had issues in Dublin where we did not have any street parking for them and that needs to be sorted.  We are very lucky to have that infrastructure but we need to take it another step forward.  The State now has to get involved in deciding how and where that infrastructure grows and develops and how it meets the needs of supporting all the EVs we hope will suddenly appear on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#R01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2471,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their excellent contributions.

Given that this in the context of the commission's accountability to the Oireachtas, it is probably worthwhile to have a very brief recap of who we are and what we do, as well as what we achieved over the years, setting out publications etc. that are produced which could assist the committee with our accountability to the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  We are now Ireland's independent energy and water regulator.  We were established in 1999 and our core function is to protect customers, whether from an economic perspective in terms of charges and customer protection measures, or from the safety perspective, which literally protects lives and property.  We have broad functions across economic safety and customer protection in energy, and in 2013 we became the economic regulator for the water and wastewater sector in Ireland.  Our mission is to regulate water, energy and energy safety in the public interest.  Our functions are encapsulated in our strategic goals and they are simply to ensure that energy and gas are supplied safety, the lights stay on and the gas continues to flow, with a reliable supply of clean water and an efficient treatment of wastewater.  Prices should be fair and reasonable and regulation should be best international practice.<\/p> <p>  To give a sense of the sorts of areas we have tackled over the years, an important element is security of supply.  In particular, there have been huge levels of investment overseen by us in the gas and particularly the electricity networks, delivering reliability and accounting for growth in the economy.  Separately, there is the development of competitive markets and other instruments to ensure we have adequate generation on the system to ensure the lights can stay on.  We have also introduced competition in the electricity and gas retail markets to the extent that they are now fully deregulated.  We have introduced a single wholesale competitive electricity market on the island of Ireland and we jointly regulate that it with our sister regulator, the utility regulator in Northern Ireland, and an independent member.  We have also established a safety framework both in respect of the safety of upstream oil and gas activities in Ireland and downstream gas in Ireland.  We also oversee the registered gas installer and registered electrical contractor schemes.<\/p> <p>  We have established the water framework under which we have completed two price controls and we have challenged Irish Water to deliver a 20% reduction in their operating expenditure over four years.  An important feature of what we do is also the customer handbook, which is essentially the minimum standards that suppliers must reach when engaging consumers.  If they fail to reach those standards, we also operate a dispute resolution function that ensures customers have somewhere to go if they cannot reach a satisfactory settlement with their supplier.  Through our networks price controls, we drive efficiencies in both the gas and electricity sectors ensuring that while meeting the needs in terms of network infrastructure investment, we also drive performance improvement.  For example, one of the key metrics we measure relates to minutes lost, which is the amount of time people have no electricity when they turn on a light.  There has been a sustained reduction in that over the years with the level of investments and improvements overseen by us.<\/p> <p>  We are also very active on the international front.  We are active members of four key international institutions.  These are the Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators and the Council of European Energy Regulators on the energy and economic side; WAREG, which is a newly established water regulatory forum across Europe; and the EU Offshore Authorities Group, a key safety forum in Europe.  We are founding members for some of those institutions.  With regard to our own operations it is probably worth pointing out we are compliant with all public sector requirements in terms of payscales and so forth.  Everything we do is ultimately subject to sanction by the Department of Finance via our own Department.<\/p> <p>  It might be worth giving a flavour of the sample of outputs we produce that would assist the committee in its oversight of the CER.  It includes our annual report and accounts which we submit and are tabled before the Oireachtas.  We have a customer care annual report that outlines the types and range of complaints we deal with throughout the year, along with the types of queries we get as an energy regulator.  We also have quarterly retail market monitoring reports and an annual substantive report on the functioning of the retail market.  We produce specialist analyses from time to time, and this year we produced a specific analysis of the state of retail competition in the energy markets.  Finally, we produce a safety annual report.  Our annual report covers both water and energy as we report to Ministers in respect of our functions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to future strategies, it is worth pointing out there are a few elements we see as key in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>There is going to be an increasing focus on our part on the role of properly structured incentives to ensure that under network price controls that network companies deliver a win-win situation for themselves and for customers.  A good example of that is GNI, Gas Networks Ireland, and how it will grow demand on a gas network which will benefit the consumer without spending too much money which would ultimately fall on the consumer.  We are trying to design incentive mechanisms to ensure we get the most out of that asset.<\/p><p> We are also looking at a new integrated single electricity market in conjunction with the North.  This will go live early next year and then there will be a serious amount of work bedding that in, as was our experience with the introduction of the first single electricity market.<\/p><p> We are launching a new HR, human resources, strategy.  As a regulator, one of our key resources is our staff.  Staff development and retention is a key issue for us into the future.  We envisage we will be producing our new energy and water strategy statements to apply from 2019 onwards because our current strategic plan applies to the end of 2018.  We foresee we will be doing a substantial amount of work in 2018 ensuring those statements will be in place from 2019 onwards.<\/p><p> There is currently an OECD review of the commission, focusing on governance, accountability and the regulatory process, compared to our peers in Europe and elsewhere.  Its report will be formally published in November with recommendations.  From that point on, we will be looking at its recommendations, trying to take them on board in our new strategy statement.  We also feel there will be opportunity to engage further with the committee on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2477,"content":"<p>Do the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment have an oversight agreement in place?

Rolling it out is more important for the North because its supply is a bit more precarious than ours.  It is also important for having a stronger market with a stronger grid for dealing with fluctuations.  For example, much wind-generated energy will be coming on to the grid and we need more capacity to absorb that.<\/p> <p>  On the cost of electricity, how did we compare with the average European price ten or 15 years ago?  Now, we have the third highest electricity costs, with only Germany and Denmark ahead of us.  Despite the fact there is a regulator in place, there is a perception CER has not been effective in overseeing the market?  There is significant frustration around that.

However, I have never changed my electricity supplier simply because of my secretary&rsquo;s experience.  The packages are complicated but are short term.  I also have not changed because I feel there is no benefit to it.  I have heard from feedback and media discussions that people feel there is no value in changing energy supplier.  The mantra is shop around and that is okay if one is buying bread.  However, if one is getting into a contract for a bill every two months, one needs to see some continuity in benefit.  I would like to see a gain over a long period that is easily explained.  There should be no-frills and cut the bullshit.

The key output of our meeting this evening is to engage ourselves in this OECD review process of CER.<\/p> <p>  The first point to make is that the OECD is in a certain state of chassis itself.  It should be slow in telling any country what to do when one of its leading members, the American Government, is now a pariah when it comes to energy and climate policy.  The first thing we should consider is what we will do with the OECD.  Who wants to be in with an American Government which is defying science and acting in a rogue state way?  We should be looking at the possibility of connecting with the Chinese or Indian Governments.  The Chinese Administration has taken some initiatives in its energy policy, such as it silk road initiative, with grid plans and ambition for decarbonisation and developing renewables.  We could learn much more from these than from the OECD.<\/p> <p>  The American Government&rsquo;s role in the OECD is now in question because of its climate policy.  The first question we should ask of any OECD review of us is what is it doing about advising other countries when one of its own leading members is outside the Pale in energy policy.<\/p> <p>  A really interesting question is how one manages a regulatory function in a Brexit-affected world.  As seems to be the case from yesterday&rsquo;s negotiations, it looks like a hard Brexit with Britain outside the customs union and the Single Market.  It will also be outside of European Court of Justice rulings.  That will be traumatic for our energy policy because it will tear up the whole market and co-operative mechanisms.  We are in a crisis situation if that happens because we have moved towards a single electricity market, as well as having significant interconnection and gas security issues with the UK.  What will Britain&rsquo;s role be in the Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators, ACER?  These are the issues and everything else in ordinary time has to be put to one side.<\/p> <p>  If we were dealing in ordinary time without America being a rogue state and Britain tearing up regulatory rulebooks, we have benefited tremendously from the EU regulatory system.  I do not believe we would have introduced this complex market regulatory system ourselves.  It came from European directives over several decades.  By and large, we have been quite good at regulation.  From my experience as a former Minister and a Member, we have an independent, capable and professional regulatory system.  While it is not the best in class, we are up there with European countries in telecommunications and energy policy.  I would like to hear anybody argue differently.  While there are failings in our system, by and large, we have a capable independent administrative system, including our regulators.<\/p><p>I cite as evidence the work we do.  While it is very sporadic, haphazard and it is far from perfect - one could look at the event just two hours previous to this of discussing electric vehicles which was a bit of a bun fight with 50 people in the room - but that is the way we do things.  We hear different stakeholders and different views.  It is our connection, however, with the regulator that is slightly strange and does not follow the normal rules.  I speak from my experience of more than ten years in the Oireachtas.  We follow what the public interest is and the public stories at the time, which are varied.  Six or seven years ago the price of electricity was the key issue at the time.  It strays into areas such as the grid and the difficulties in building the grid and wind power infrastructure due to public opposition.  How would Dr. McGowan and the CER explain to anyone in the OECD the situation in Ireland regarding water charges?  How could Dr. McGowan assess the Commission for Energy Regulation's performance in terms of setting a proper charging system for water when we all know it was the political system and the political dynamics that dominated and which are very hard to explain?<\/p><p> If this meeting is to discuss Oireachtas oversight, there is a game changer, not just because of the US Government changes or Brexit, and that it is a wider change in the European Union.  The days are over of the 1990s obsession with the market knows best approach.  The market has a role and we need enterprise, but we are now in an environment where the State will take a stronger role.  Ultimately, we need to meet the climate objectives to make such a radical change.  The market cannot do it on its own and we cannot rely on market mechanisms.  We must get the State with its regulatory, administrative and political systems to take some risks and to make some bets and investments that the market never would.  If I was to change the system, I would look at where we are today with the lack of advancement and investment,  smart metering, electric vehicles, offshore energy, solar power and demand management mechanisms.  We have the real potential to be brilliant at this.  In some instances, we are very good.  We are very good at integrating renewable power.  We are fairly good at energy efficiency in certain areas.  We are not, however, grasping the goal which is a massive leap towards the low-carbon future.  The regulator has a key role in that but it should not necessarily be just an obsession with market arrangements.  I do not believe in the old trialogue of security and economic value and the environment.  The environment must come first because it is a physics parameter that cannot be ignored.  The other two aspects of competition and security of supply can be met in a range of different ways but we cannot ignore the physics of climate change anymore.  The regulator and the administrative system needs to start taking a few more risks and bets and not worry about failing.  If it fails the political system would carry the can.  We need to make the same sorts of leaps made when the State was founded such the development of hydropower and others.  We need to make that scale of jump.  While the regulator has a role it is not on the old market-knows-best regulatory system, where the income will deliver it, which is no longer credible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#T00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2481,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan.

I will start by answering a few of the specific questions.  With regard to the oversight agreement, it is currently compliant with the code of practice as of 2009.  We are currently working with the Department on the new code of practice for governance of State bodies to reach compliance by the end of this year.  We have just come to the end of a gap analysis.  We will then be in discussions with the Department as to what, if any, form of oversight agreement we would need.  That will be clarified later this year.  Our aim is that by the third quarter we will have identified, and hopefully have everything in place in terms of compliance.  We will then carry out our own internal audit to make sure we are fully compliant with the new code of practice by year end.  It is my understanding that the Department is now talking to all the sectoral regulators to ensure they have a level of consistency around the form and content of oversight agreements should they be needed.<\/p> <p>  On the concept of comply or explain, it is fair to say that the code of practice on the governance of State bodies assumes there is a board and a chief executive and that it is almost a commercial semi-State organisation in some ways.  We are obviously not like that and there are some areas where we are not in compliance, but can easily explain why not.  We are largely complaint with the code of practice, but we have yet to conclude our gap analysis.  Part of that will be working with the Department to ensure we have the appropriate oversight agreement, in whatever form it may be required.<\/p> <p>  Our 2016 annual report is currently in preparation and in the next week or two we will be looking at our accounts.  The body of the report on what we have undertaken during the year is currently in preparation and it will be the third quarter of this year before we will publish that report.  This is being realistic in the context of where we are in the development of that report.<\/p> <p>  As part of our annual work planning, which we submit to the Department, we seek to establish as set of key performance indicators, KPIs, based on what we hope to achieve in the year, by which we can be judged.  One of the key outputs that may be of benefit to the committee is our annual work planning cycle, which itself is based on our strategic plan.  We set ourselves a series of goals around work we want to achieve such as advancing the iSEM, the all-island single electricity market, initiating some new piece of policy implementation based on new legislation or a review of existing piece of work.  The goals may include elements of business as usual such as running a complaints service for consumers where we try to set realistic KPIs.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Brexit.  Ms Brien will cover some of the questions on electricity prices and the single electricity market as raised by Deputy Stanley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2483,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question on timescale for the revision to the single electricity market rules.  Our target for the new rules to be in place is May 2018.  As Dr. McGowan explained, we have a single electricity market today.  It has been up and running since 2007.  We are revising the rules to make them compliant with the broader pan-European electricity market.  The revised rules should be in place in May 2018, which is the target.<\/p> <p>  On the costs and prices of electricity, we rely on a very good report produced by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the comparison of residential and commercial electricity prices in Ireland relative to our European peers.  It is coming out with a new metric that looks at a weighted average price across a range of consumption values.  The level of consumption in Ireland is different from other countries.  When we look at that average, our prices have been at or below the EU area average for the last couple of six month periods.  Denmark and Germany are outliers, but when we average across all the countries within the eurozone area, Ireland is at the average level.  We are not necessarily an outlier but we recognise that we have some underlying costs that tend to make us that much more expensive.  We have a very geographically dispersed population.  This means that for each customer we end up having to build more distribution lines and this leads to the delivery of electricity within Ireland being more expensive than more densely populated countries such as The Netherlands or France.  Ireland is not really out of line in that respect.<\/p> <p>  The members asked about switching and the duration of deals.  Obviously, the commercial offerings of suppliers are based on their own ideas of what they think is best for their companies.  Most of them tend to have a large initial discount for a 12-month period and the price then reverts to a more standard tariff after that.  Not all companies have adopted that pricing strategy.  Some companies have adopted a different pricing strategy of a smaller discount over three years.  There is some variety out there.  The Commission for Energy Regulation supports switching as one of the ways that customers can get the benefits of competition.  By shopping around, switching is straightforward, fast and free.  A customer who is a dual fuel home customer could save &euro;200 to &euro;300 per year, even today, by switching to a different supplier for that initial 12-month discount period.<\/p><p>While we do not promote anyone in particular we accredit price comparison websites.  There are two price comparison websites that are accredited by the CER and we always encourage people to go to those and put in a consumption level or an average consumption.  The websites then display the level of competitive offers that are available.<\/p><p> The issue around the public service obligation was also raised.  Obviously, the CER does not set the level of renewable supports that the PSO levy goes to fund.  We act on behalf of the Department to calculate the level of the levy every year.  In recent weeks we have come out with a proposed decision with regard to the levy that would apply for the 2017-18 period.  As was pointed out, because of the increased levels of renewables on the system, the levy will be supporting approximately 500 MW more wind generation in the coming year compared to the previous year.  The overall level of the levy that we have gone out with regard to the proposed consultation is higher than last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497975000,"counter":2485,"content":"<p>How much higher?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017062000002#V00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497975000,"counter":2486,"content":"<p>It is a little over &euro;100 million higher.

This applies primarily to gas because the renewables are replacing gas.  Wholesale prices during the past three years have been lower than in the past.  It is a combination of increased renewables and a reduction in natural gas prices, which is the fuel that sets the price on the margin.

There is a network of economic regulators under which that review is being carried out.  Basically, they got a tried and tested model.  In fairness to the OECD, the model has been developed along the lines of how the International Energy Agency might carry out a country review.  It is very much a peer review.  Next week, those involved are bringing people from Mexico, Italy and Great Britain over.  These are people who have extensive experience of being reviewed and running regulatory agencies.

I am joined by Dr. Cormac Keating, who led the paper's development, Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll, director with responsibility for financial education and consumer information, and Mr. Harry O'Rahilly, a case officer and economist who did much of the work on the report.<\/p><p>The report itself is the outcome of much consultation and research we did.  We talked to many different stakeholder groups, including consumer representative groups and industry players, both here and internationally.  We talked to those already in the market offering mortgages and those who are not but might potentially be at some stage.  We did a public consultation and commissioned research to examine consumers' perceptions and experiences of the market through focus groups.  We put together all this information to develop an evidence-based analysis, which then formed the basis of the 14 actions which we believe need to be considered by the Government and policy makers.<\/p><p> Due to time limitations, we cannot go through every one of the actions in detail today.  However, they are all contained in our written submission.  I will take the committee through some of them now but we are happy to make ourselves available to any committee member who would like a more in-depth briefing.<\/p><p> It will be no surprise to committee members that our analysis showed the market is quite dysfunctional, both from a competition and consumer perspective.  That is the legacy of the past 15 years of boom and bust.  It took us a long time to get to the stage at which we are today.  I am afraid our analysis is that it will take some considerable time to get out of it again.  The mortgage market is tightly connected with the economy and with society.  We all know the effect both lenders and borrowers can have on the stability of the banking system as a whole.  It is also heavily impacted by other policies, including housing strategies, the rental market, public housing policy and policies regarding insolvencies and repossession.<\/p><p> Having done this analysis, we did not find any silver bullet, any more than anybody else who has examined the market over the past ten years.  We do not believe there are immediate remedies that will reduce mortgage rates and fix all the other aspects we found to be dysfunctional.  However, we believe there are some short-term, medium-term and long-term measures, which if implemented, will enable us to start building a mortgage market which is more competitive, stable and fit for purpose.  We see the options we set out not as the end of discussion but as a starting point.<\/p><p> Significant consideration needs to be given by policy makers as to the type of mortgage market Ireland wants in the long run.  It will be no surprise we found the market is distorted with a high concentration of a small number of players which have a high market share.  There is limited competition between those lenders and a low-level of entry by new players.<\/p><p> The mortgage market is one which will always have to be tightly regulated.  It is not in anybody's interest that it should operate as a freely functioning market with credit being inappropriately thrown into it.  We believe, however, an appropriate framework of prudential regulation can coexist alongside robust competition.  One does not need to be sacrificed for the other; one can have both.<\/p><p> There are issues around the level of competition in the market but those are not the only ones.  There is significant Government involvement which can act as a disincentive to new entrants coming in from outside.  There are market distortions caused by the large scale of tracker mortgages.  There is a mix-up between the market for primary dwelling houses and for the rental or investment market, namely, buy-to-let mortgages.  In some cases, primary homes have been used as collateral for property investment.  Consumers bought houses as an investment and used the primary home as security.  When the crash happened, they were left with declining asset values, falling incomes and large outstanding debt.<\/p><p> Our analysis also indicated there is a lack of a predictable and consistent practice when dealing with mortgage loans which have fallen into arrears.  This means that banks had to have more capital in order to write further mortgages.  Capital is costly and that feeds into mortgage rates.  We believe the prevailing mortgage rates are a reflection of all these market characteristics.<\/p><p> Through consumer research, we tried to find out what consumers wanted from the market.  We are trying to propose options towards building a market that is fit for purpose and serves the need of consumers.  One issue that came out strongly was a big level of mistrust between consumers and lenders, particularly considering new lenders and international financial institutions.  There was a tendency for consumers to go back to the names they knew from a long time with a distrust of new ones.  They have seen some institutions come and go in the past and are sceptical about their level of long-term commitment to Ireland.<\/p><p> Consumers also have a real sense of vulnerability, which manifests itself in a number of different ways.  People are quite reluctant to switch mortgage providers, even when there is clear evidence they would benefit greatly from doing so.  They are reluctant to lock into long-term mortgage rates, which makes Ireland quite different from the continental market where mortgages tend to be much more based on longer terms.<\/p><p>That distrust and reluctance to switch has an effect on the level of competition and how effective measures would be to introduce further competition.  From all the issues we have talked to consumers about, such as mortgage regulation, housing policy, arrears and repossessions, when we distilled it down, what consumers want is to be able to get a mortgage, they want certainty about what they are paying for their mortgage and they want a clear and fair process if they find themselves in arrears.  They do not necessarily want no process or for the process to drag on forever but they want to be clear on the process and want to have an end date in time.<\/p><p> The options we put forward then are how we believe policy makers, regulators like ourselves, financial institutions all working together can create a mortgage market which meets those needs that consumers have expressed.  Some of those address issues we accept are sensitive in nature but we think they need to be considered and we do not put them forward lightly.<\/p><p> First and foremost in order to address this point about loans for investment purposes being mixed up with loans for family homes, we need to have a national vision as to what exactly we as a nation want from our mortgage market.  Are those two types of loans the same thing?  Do we want the mortgage market to be there to provide ordinary working people on ordinary incomes with the ability to have homes, to pay off the loan over a number of years and end up in possession of their homes or do we want the mortgage market to function also as a sort of investment vehicle?  We think those are two quite different types of objectives.  At present they are tangled up.  It might be that we need to separate those two out and we have put forward some options as regards that.<\/p><p> We have some short-term proposals.  We think that increasing competition is extremely important, that more new entrants would increase competition as would building trust among consumers as to their certainty and the degree of regulation that they are assured of in moving to those new entrants.  We think there is a job to be done in rebuilding our international reputation.  We think there is a perception out there among the international lenders that things are worse than they are, that they are back five or seven years ago when we were in the worst of the crash.  We are saying that the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise and Innovation could get out there and talk to international lenders and do a road show and assure people that we are working through the problems and that we are an attractive option for new entrants.<\/p><p> We also think a number of actions could be taken by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance to encourage new types of lending initiatives, new sorts of lenders coming in.  It does not have to be the traditional standard bricks and mortar type banks.  There are other types of lenders out there, they may be a niche market at present, but we are seeing this in other countries.  We have some examples as to how those kinds of innovative lenders could be, how it is done in other jurisdictions and how we might try it here.  There are procedures that we would like to get involved in as regards making switching easier - for instance, moving to a more electronic form of conveyancing because conveyancing is expensive, slow and is very heavily paper based, making the process for switching between banks or lenders easier and quicker for consumers.  <\/p><p> In the longer term we have a question as to whether the way the mortgage market is currently funded is the correct way.  What we have is long-term loans going out on one side and short-term funding coming in on the other.  The mortgages are being funded by deposits.  We know there are other models and we looked in particular in the paper at the Danish model where the banks issue a covered bond, which is specifically for mortgages.  If there is a 20-year mortgage, it is covered by a 20-year bond on the other side, so there is a match and that seems to work very well for them and brings a lot of stability and certainty to the market.<\/p><p> We have seen a lack of a predictable and consistent approach to dealing with those in arrears and we strongly suggest that this needs to change.  There seems to be what might be termed a postcode or Eircode lottery, where the speed with which issues are resolved depends on where one is living.  Different District Courts do different things, the registrars do a lot of mediation in bringing banks and lenders together.  There is a great deal of variation.  That impacts on consumers but it also means it increases the risk for banks and that means they need more capital to write the loans and that means the loans are most costly.<\/p><p> This is a very significant and complex market.  We need to think very carefully about any proposed interventions or structural changes and have a detailed assessment of their implications and consequences.  This is big challenge for us all.  It is a challenge for members as policy makers, for us as regulators in the areas in which we would like to get involved and for the lenders as well.  We feel confident that the options we have set out will at least facilitate that consideration and if further progressed, could offer both consumers and financial institutions more choice and more certainty.<\/p><p> Chairman, we will be very happy to take any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2505,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Goggin.

The reason I asked that question is that there is a bit of grey area in that the role, the responsibilities are basically passed on to the Central Bank of Ireland, which carries out those functions and has a statutory function to carry out those functions.  In my view, the Central Bank of Ireland does not have the resources to carry out those functions and has done a terrible job on it in the past number of years.  Given that the Central Bank of Ireland is 200 staff members below what its internal documents suggest should be its staff complement, then something is giving and it is probably the consumer protection role that suffers.<\/p> <p>  We have seen scandal after scandal over the years.  Ms Goggin referred to confidence in banks but confidence has been shattered.  We have seen 15,000 customers wrongly taken off tracker or not put on tracker mortgages.  We have seen the payment protection insurance, PPI, scandal, which has seen tens of thousands of individuals, and a court case earlier this year, which was withdrawn from the Court of Appeal, which means that the case stands, namely, that a financial company mis-sold payment protection insurance, PPI, which was not detected by the Central Bank in its assessment, yet organisations such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is saying nothing about it.  Given the consumer protection role of the CCPC and bearing in mind the consumer protection role the Central Bank has, is there not a responsibility for the CCPC to make people aware that a major financial institution sold a product here which has been found by the High Court to constitute mis-selling and that all the products that was sold by it, a number which runs to thousands, were sold under the exact same contract and therefore the consumers should check their contract to see if they were conned by this institution?  Is that not a role that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission should play?  Does the CCPC have a statutory role or remit to do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#J00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2510,"content":"<p>I was conferring with my colleagues.

To where do they go if they have a problem? Do they contact the Financial Services Ombudsman?

The person then has to go back to the institution.

Protection, however, is in making sure that people have not been stung in the first place.  It is about trying to protect individuals.  I believe there is nothing to prohibit the organisation that has \"consumer protection\" within its title from looking at the judgment, looking at the withdrawal of the Court of Appeal decision and looking at the fact that GE Money has issued contracts to thousands of individuals.  One of those contracts was taken before the High Court in a test case and was found to be a mis-sold financial product.  I believe that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission should be highlighting this and making people aware that this is an issue they should look at, and if they feel it is necessary then they should bring a case to the Financial Service Ombudsman.  It is not right.<\/p> <p>  We have had the situation around the tracker mortgages and that has rightly rattled the confidence in the banking system.  It started with just a couple of individuals; people who slogged it out against all the odds.  They kept going and persevering and all the rest.  The next thing is the gates open and it transpires that approximately 15,000 individuals have been caught in this regard.  I appeal to the CCPC to look at that role, bearing in mind that it is a bit of a mess.  The witnesses understand that from working in the sector, and members may understand it from being on this committee, but were I sitting at home and googling for information, I would expect the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to hold that role.  However, it really does not as it is the Central Bank that has the powers.  I would be interested to know if the commission would like more of a role in consumer protection.  I remember engaging with the witnesses on what we called the insurance rip-off issue.  Again, the commission had no real role in that matter because the powers and responsibilities lay with the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the mortgage market.

With our competition hats on, market failure would have a very specific meaning.  The problem is that there is a lot of different groups of consumers and the market is not working for them in different ways.  The immediate issue, which is what prompted the commitment in the programme for Government and which got us looking at it in the first place, is the relatively high rates for standard variable rate mortgages.  This is a cohort of people who have a mortgage and are repaying at an interest rate well above the ECB rate.  It is well above what people are paying in other similar jurisdictions.  There is another cohort of people who are in arrears and there are non-performing loans.  There is also the issue of repossessions and so on, which is a huge problem because it is one of the most traumatic things that can ever happen to somebody.  The idea of losing one's home is right up there with bereavement in the stress it causes for people.  There is a third cohort, which is a bit invisible, comprising the people who cannot get a mortgage.  They cannot get a mortgage because the market is perceived as risky and when a market is perceived as risky the banks will lend to the most secure borrowers.  The banks will lend to the people who are looking for a fairly low loan-to-value ratio and they will lend to people on good incomes.  They will not lend to people who are on lower incomes or to people who are looking for a higher loan-to-value ratio.

The Central Bank has informed this committee that it does not want that role because it is really the role of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  If the Bill were law today, and given the analysis the witnesses have just done on the mortgage market, do they believe there is a market failure as defined by that proposed legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#L00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2523,"content":"<p>No, not as defined by that legislation.  One would have to go into quite a lot more detail about what exactly the market is and which bunch of consumers we are talking about.  As I have said, there are all sorts of consumers in this regard: the people who are on tracker mortgage rates who are doing very well, the people who cannot get into the market at all, and the people who are in the market but are either paying more than they otherwise would or are not able to keep up repayments due to the rates they are on.  We responded to the consultation on that and it is our view we would appreciate the feeling behind the desire to cap interest rates but we do not think it would work.  It would discourage people from entering the market.  We believe that the long-term solution is to get secure and reputable lenders in.  If the rates are capped, it is a signal to banks that there is a lot of government interference in the market and they do not like that.  This has come out very clearly from the interviews conducted by Dr. Keating and Mr. O'Rahilly.<\/p> <p>  Elsewhere, banks typically react to rate caps by saying to themselves, \"If I am not making the margin I used to, then it makes the lending more risky.\"  They will withdraw credit from the cheaper products that are typically designed to bring in new customers and they will try to get higher charges from their existing customers, not through the interest rate but through different fees and so on.

Reference was made to the dysfunctional nature of and lack of competition in the market.  One would imagine that if the banks are all offering the same products and if there is lack of competition, then there is an opening for a bank to come in and undercut them or make profits.  However, that has obviously not happened and, as a result, the normal rules or hypotheses are not playing out.  Perhaps the witnesses could explain the reason for that.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned about and very opposed to the proposal put forward that there would be a review of section 149, which requires authorisation by the Central Bank before banks can increase their fees.  I cannot for the life of me understand why an organisation that has consumer protection in its title would try to give banks a free hand to increase their fees because that is undoubtedly what they would do if they did not have to go through a more rigorous process in terms of seeking pre-authorisation from the Central Bank.  Could the witnesses explain the reason for that proposal?  Bank of Ireland made a profit of &euro;167 million last year.  AIB made a profit of nearly &euro;1 billion last year.  Those are pre-tax profits but because of the deal Fine Gael and Labour did, the banks are not paying any tax as a result of the fact that they are allowed to carry over losses from previous years.  Why is there a desire to loosen their hands in respect of fees?  Surely to God if that provision had not been there in the past, we would have seen additional fees for credit cards and transactions?  The technology we are using in terms of contactless payments is great but it costs one more money every time one uses the bloody contactless card.  People are not aware of that.  I am not sure what the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is doing to highlight the fact that every time one buys something for a euro and one uses one's card, one pays more than a euro because there is a cost for the use of the card.  Why is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission asking that section 149 would be reviewed to allow the banks a free hand in increasing their fees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#M00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2527,"content":"<p>I will start with the concern about why we are not seeing new entrants.

If one is a foreign bank or lending institution and one is looking at coming into a market, we have a few hits against us.  First, we are quite a small market.  Second, there is the hangover from the crash and that is why we were suggesting that we need to get out there and paint the picture that Ireland Inc. is improving, that the economy is picking up and that unemployment has gone down so more people are in employment and can afford housing and other things.

Regarding the issue of vulture funds and where loan books were sold, we have been very vocal that the consumer protections that applied to the consumers at the time they took out the contracts are retained, regardless of ownership.  What has come across from the work that has been undertaken on repossession - Mr. Keating may want to comment on this as well - is that it is precisely that uncertainty the Senator spoke about that has emerged as the issue.  In our introduction, our chairperson said it is like a postcode lottery.  It also depends on who one's lender is.  Those two issues need to be considered.  For consumers who have sleepless nights and who fear their house might be repossessed, they have no clarity as to what the process is or how long it will take.  This is why one of the options we have outlined is that the system be examined to give people more certainty in order that even for people who are in that horrible position of their financial situation not having changed and not being able to reach any kind of deal on repayments with the bank, at least there is a resolution to it.  From a consumer perspective, that horrible spectre of potentially losing one's house has been hanging around some people for years, and it is not fair to consumers to leave them in that position.  The system therefore needs to be much clearer for people, and State supports need to be in place to help them through that system as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2579,"content":"<p>Where does Ms Carroll see the responsibility for this?

The key finding is that people get themselves into this terrible situation by effectively putting their heads in the sand and not engaging with their lenders or with other services that could provide help to them.  We examined this and thought how we might be able to change it and incentivise people not to do it.  One of the suggestions we make in the paper is to introduce this idea of a suspended repossession order so that when one goes to court and the case is kicked down the road repeatedly, the judge instead gives an order to issue a suspended repossession order.  This focuses the mind very quickly and causes the consumer to get in touch with his or her lender and hammer out a deal, and deals are being hammered out.

When they turned to consumer protection, they believe that the agencies responsible for consumer protection, be it the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission or the Central Bank, abandoned them.

The consumers in this area and in respect of the tracker mortgages feel totally abandoned, as if nobody cared about them in the slightest.

I hope the Chairman will forgive me if I seem a little anxious; the issues are so important to so many people.  I ask the committee members to imagine what it must be like for someone appearing in a courtroom not too dissimilar to this setting.  Probably for the first time, the person is appearing as a defendant attempting to protect his or her home from a bank or, worse still, a vulture fund that is here only to profit from the crisis in which many people now find themselves trapped.  That scenario is the only motivation behind the proposed large-scale solution.  We are looking for the political will to help make this happen and are asking all politicians from all parties to get behind the Bill.<\/p><p>By way of introduction, I am co-founder of Right2Homes, which is a not-for-profit organisation.  I am joined on this panel today by my fellow Right2Homes director, Mr. Austin Byrne, and by Ms Sandra Daly, Mr. Michael Durkan, Ms Caroline Lennon-Nally and Mr. Jim O'Connell.  Together we are representing our trustees and also the umbrella group, drawn from like-minded organisations and individual advocates, engaged in seeking legislative change and solutions to the distressed mortgages crisis.  We are delighted and honoured to have been given this opportunity to address the committee in respect of its review of the Irish mortgage market and related matters as this is the focus of the proposed National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017, the details of which we will discuss today.<\/p><p> This committee has undoubtedly received many detailed submissions in respect of these matters so we do not propose to subject it to yet more damning statistics, alarming and shocking as they may well be.  Instead, we are here to talk about a big idea, a solution to the crisis involving the related areas of homelessness, social and affordable housing and the lack thereof, and of course distressed family home mortgages.  These three defining issues are joined at the hip but, for the purpose of today's meeting, we are focusing on the proposed national housing co-operative and the attendant explanatory memorandum, copies of which the committee will have received prior to today's meeting.<\/p><p> Some of us here today have literally put our own lives on hold to get this proposed legislation to this stage, and I doubt there is anyone in this room, or even anyone watching, who is not already acutely aware of the nightmare currently faced by many Irish families still residing in their family homes or, indeed, in buy-to-let accommodation.  They live in daily fear of banks, afraid to open their hall doors or even their post, defenceless in the absence of effective legislation to protect themselves and their families from the threat of repossessions.  We believe this proposed legislation can provide a tangible solution for all that.<\/p><p> The proposed national co-operative is designed to keep people in their existing homes through the creation of a benevolent society as outlined in the proposed Bill.  It may perhaps be helpful to give the committee a short history of the events leading up to the creation of this Bill which members have in their hands today and which will soon be presented to other Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to debate and eventually vote on.  The Chairman, together with Deputy Mattie McGrath and Senator David Norris, who joins us here today, have all committed to ensuring this proposal will see the light of day and be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We express our sincere gratitude to them and to the Chairman of this committee for making that a reality and for providing this tangible ray of hope for so many.<\/p><p> The first step in the creation of the national housing co-operative began in this very room last January following an appearance by me before this very same committee.  I had received an invitation from Mr. Jerry Beades, chairman of Friends of Banking Ireland, to join him and others in presenting submissions to this committee.  They had been invited to address matters related to the banking crisis.  Perhaps it was down to some naivety on my part, but I was genuinely shocked at what appeared to me, back then at least, to be a distinct lack of urgency, with little or no sense of emergency about those proceedings.  A crisis, by its very definition, requires urgent action, and the power to make this solution a reality resides within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What could be more important or pressing than the imminent fear of a family losing their home, a matter of life and death for some, unfortunately, and yet there I was back in January being confronted with the vista of a half-empty chamber towards the end of that three-hour submission.<\/p><p> I was asked afterwards by the Chairman, for whom we have the greatest respect, if I was happy with how that meeting had gone.  I immediately answered \"no\", which led to a series of phone calls, to be fair, and which in turn resulted in an invitation from the Chairman to return the following day to discuss the views expressed.  This in turn led to Right2Homes receiving an invitation from Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy Darragh O'Brien to involve an umbrella group of like-minded advocates in drafting a Bill capable of halting the transfer of home loans from banks to vulture funds and also a Bill that would facilitate the creation of a benevolent entity to house the tens of thousands affected by distressed family home mortgages.<\/p><p>This is what we set about doing, and today we are proud to present to this committee, and to the people, a framework for a solution that has been carefully crafted by independent experts.  These experts include the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, who is here today in a private capacity, and Mr. Pat O'Sullivan, a retired fellow of the Institute of Bankers.  Both have kindly agreed to join us for the purpose of this submission, which is hugely important given the serious nature of the proposal and the complexities of the proposed legislation.  They will be joined on that panel of experts by Dr. Rory Hearne, Mr. Maoil&iacute;osa Reynolds, Mr. Anthony Joyce and Fr. Peter McVerry, who needs no introduction and who should be applauded for the wonderful work he does for the homeless.<\/p><p> We have three hugely important phrases we wish to impress on the committee and which it is hoped will help to replace the widespread uncertainty and fear with a message of renewed hope and fairness.  The first is \"keep people in their homes\", the second is \"halt the sale of loans to vulture funds\" and finally, together, summon the \"political will\" to help make this proposal a reality.<\/p><p> Without any further delay, I will now ask my fellow Right2Homes director, Dr. Austin Byrne, to read Part 1 of the explanatory memorandum, which will, it is hoped, form the basis for further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2608,"content":"<p>A watershed moment in the distressed Irish residential mortgage crisis is upon us for a variety of reasons, with more than 100,000 Irish residential mortgages in various levels of arrears.  In excess of 6% of total residential mortgages in Ireland are now in the hands of so-called vulture funds.  Contrary to what we are led to believe, with regard to the common good, there is no economic, social or moral benefit in having vulture funds operating in Ireland and their presence should be discouraged forthwith.<\/p> <p>  As the economy moves through recovery, the fact is simply that this rising tide is not lifting all boats.  Due to the sheer numbers of citizens affected, the medium to long-term effects cannot be measured in terms of moral and social impact, although we are seeing increases in reported cases of alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, mental illness, and marital and family breakdown.  Every occupant of an affected Irish residential dwelling, whether they are a mortgagor or a tenant, is in the firing line of the stated intentions of the banks and those of the vulture funds which will ultimately own these properties.  The banks are, in turn, under increasing pressure from the ECB to address their distressed loan books.<\/p> <p>  The question I would ask all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas is what side they are on - that of the common good or that of the vulture funds?  The National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017 proposes a two-pronged approach to the issue of mortgage arrears.  The first concerns legal matters and the second addresses financial aspects.  When both these areas are consolidated, the real success will be measured in the numbers of families who remain in their homes, regardless of their status as borrowers or tenants.<\/p> <p>  Several adjustments to existing legislation are proposed to enhance the ability of the courts to deal with applications for possession and sale of property-securing defaulting loans in a fairer, more transparent way and to eliminate the practice of bundling large numbers of loans into portfolios for sale to vulture funds, while at the same time ensuring that where an order for sale of a property securing a defaulted loan is granted by the court, it is managed to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved for both the lender and the borrower.  Additionally, increased application of relevant EU law is proposed to ensure existing protections for borrowers are recognised and considered by the courts.<\/p> <p>  The proposed legislation is potentially an all-encompassing solution to the issue of residential dwelling mortgage arrears, regardless of whether the underlying security for such loans is a family home or a buy-to-let investment property.  After all, they are all someone's home.  The controversial issues of strategic defaulters and moral hazard will be dealt with in detail case by case basis.  In truth, the real moral hazard is in simply doing nothing.  This Bill will have the effect of essentially resolving the social calamity unfolding in Ireland as a result of residential mortgage arrears.<\/p> <p>  In closing, and before I hand over to the panel of experts assembled to answer the committee's questions, I should say that as private citizens we are all entitled to the benefits that status affords each of us, but with that status comes a degree of responsibility.  In my private life, my employment denotes that I am a public servant, but in reality, we are all public servants.  We serve the society we live in.  We cannot individually exist in a vacuum.  If we want society, now and into the future, to be a fair and just society inclusive of all, we must, each of us individually, ask two simple questions in respect of the home mortgage crisis and the consequential impacts accruing from failed attempts to deal with that crisis.<\/p><p>If not us, then who?  If not now, then when?  Members and witnesses have a very real opportunity to step up and implement the comprehensive solution contained in the proposed legislation.  The future effects of doing nothing will be immeasurable on many levels in terms of our society.  I am privileged to have had the opportunity to make an impact and work with the excellent like-minded people here today, whom I have come to know and with whom I have forged friendships that will last a lifetime.  They are, for the most part, far removed from my normal life and our paths, in ordinary circumstances, may never have crossed.  Our umbrella group has collectively found the will and wherewithal to bring this critically important legislation to this point.  We will continue to push for this solution but it is up to members to take a position, choose which side they are on and work with us to keep people in their homes.  It is up to the members.  The time is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Austin Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2610,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Chair, it is our intention to withdraw and introduce the panel of experts to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2611,"content":"<p>That is fine.

I always feel slightly put off that I cannot stand up while making a speech because my practice as a barrister is to stand up and walk around while so doing.  I will try to assist the committee with the legal aspects of the proposals it has before it.  If I were teaching law, I would ask members to write down the terms \"foreclosure\", \"redemption\", \"equitable right to redeem\", \"equity of redemption\", \"sale\", \"possession\", \"repossession\", \"vacant possession\", \"execution\", \"squatter\" and \"eviction\".  I would ask the members to pick any four of the above and explain them, writing only on one side of the paper.  These are terms with which lay litigants must deal in court.  Even some lawyers appearing before me do not understand these terms.  Nevertheless, this is the vernacular of litigation in the area of mortgages.<\/p> <p>  It will be of interest to the committee to know that the term \"foreclosure\" has been abolished since 2009.  That is a regret because that word has a real human meaning to it.  It denotes the precise point at which the right of the occupants to reside in a premises ceases.  The fact that foreclosure has been abolished as a legal remedy to be replaced, in effect, by the order for sale, has caused some confusion in the minds of commentators.  Any mortgage deed involves two parties: the mortgagee or banker and mortgagor or borrower.  Each has rights.  On one side there is foreclosure, which is the right of the mortgagee, while on the other side there is the right of redemption.  Members may not have come across that word.  Those are equal rights.<\/p> <p>  An examination of 19th century law will reveal foreclosure claims by mortgagees and redemption claims by mortgagors.  In those days, redemption claims far outnumbered foreclosure claims.  It was not unheard of, rather, it was more usual to have a claim by a mortgagor for redemption of the mortgage in a situation such as a person wanting to put the money on the table and demand the return of his or her property.  Foreclosure and redemption were the two equal measures.  Underlying them were subsidiary or ancillary reliefs such as orders for sale and for possession.<\/p><p>Depending on which way the case was going, the mortgagor or the mortgagee might be looking for an order for sale.  Believe it or not, there were cases where the mortgagors wanted to force the banks to sell.  As recently as 1997, there were English cases involving mortgagors having to take banks to court to get orders for sale.  Nevertheless, the availability of sale and possession as remedies fluctuates between the mortgagor and the mortgagee.  Sale and possession may be ordered as ancillary to foreclosure or in relation to redemption.  It is like a tug of war between the two parties and is not fixed.  In this Bill, I am relying on that key legal mechanism.<br\/><br\/>The repossession list of Thursday last included the names Derek, Joseph and Anne Maire, Colm, Stephen and Marie, Stephen and Miriam, Colm and Sharon, Paul and Natalie, Ray and Martina, Nora, Chris and Sandra, Abdul and Aleesa, Mary, Brian, Andrew and Sinead, Emma and Brendan, Marius and Claudia, Martin, Thomas, Helen, Brian and Patricia, Lisa, Clyde and another Lisa, Desmond and Adrienne, Harry and Martina, John and Antoinette, Michael, another Michael, William and Maria, William, Martina and Patrick, Mark, Gavin and Sorcha, Wesley and Carol, Geraldine and Anthony, Joseph, Patrick, Catherine, Philip and Michelle, Kerry, Sarah and Thomas, Gillian and Philip.  These people are last Thursday's hidden homeless.  They have lost the right to live in the houses in which they are living.  There were 41 cases and, by my reckoning, 69 defendants.<br\/><br\/>Under the European Convention on Human Rights, each defendant is entitled to effective participation in the proceedings.  Why, then, is there a Circuit Court practice direction by the President of the Circuit Court that the plaintiffs should write to the defendants by letter from the plaintiff or the plaintiff's solicitor stating that, except with the consent of each defendant, no order for possession will be made on the initial return date and the proceedings will be adjourned to a later date?  The defendants, having received such a letter, find that of great relief and believe they do not have to turn up to court.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Justice and Equality then says that these people will not engage.  Not only that, newspapers say that they find it astonishing that only 12 defendants turned up from a list of 70 and they think that the other 58 are strategic borrowers who could not care less.  If one receives a letter such as the one directed by the President of the Circuit Court in respect of one's first appearance, one will naturally walk straight past the court, whistling.  The next time one is told to come in, one will decide to take a chance on it.  The time after that, one will take a further chance on it.  Eventually, it will be too late and the sheriff will be at the door.  That is a problem and Ireland could be in trouble with the European court in relation to that practice direction.<br\/><br\/>Only a handful of defendants had legal representation.  Most defendants did not attend.  Five orders for possession were made, some cases were struck out and the balance were adjourned to mid-November.  Do members know who these people are?  No.  Nor do I.  How many families?  How long have they been living at the mortgaged home?  We can only guess; perhaps ten or 15 years.  There is a dearth of sociological data or demographic information.  We do not know how many of these defendants are in mortgage arrears for 720 days and upwards or how many are only three months in arrears, nor do we know how many have recently restructured loans which have under-performed.  We do not know why they stopped paying.  We do not know if there are any freeloaders gaming the system or whether the defendants are all collateral damage caught in the crossfire caused by the 2008 recession.  The overwhelming impression anecdotally available to me and, I suspect, to members in their constituency clinics, is that these people are sub-prime borrowers who should probably never have been given mortgages in the first place.  It is not their fault that public housing was unavailable back then.  The crisis is not that these people are heavily in debt, it is that when they are eventually evicted, and they will be unless the committee acts promptly, there will still be no public housing for them.<br\/><br\/>Members of the committee should brace themselves.  This is the Joint Committee of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach.  Evicting one occupier costs money.  The wholesale eviction of many thousands over the next four or five years will cost millions of euro and the taxpayer will foot the bill.  A judgment of the European Court of Human Rights regarding a difficult eviction said:<\/p><blockquote>The council applied to the High Court for enforcement of the order for possession.  On 24 July 2000, the High Court ordered the sheriff to execute the warrant for possession.  The sheriff&rsquo;s officer, the bailiffs and the West Yorkshire police carried out a planning and risk assessment.  The sheriff&rsquo;s officer attended the site and requested the applicant to vacate the plot.  He refused.On 1 August 2000, early in the morning, the council commenced enforcement of the eviction, in an operation involving council officers, the sheriff&rsquo;s officers and numerous police officers.  The applicant stated that also police helicopter, police dogs, control centre, numerous police vehicles and detention vans were employed.<\/blockquote><p>The operation lasted five hours.  The judgment continued:<\/p><blockquote>The applicant stated that it was not until late afternoon that their own caravan was returned to them.  During 3 August, the Council returned their possessions, including a washing machine, drier, microwave, gas bottles, kettle and clothing.  This was dumped on the roadside some distance away from the applicant&rsquo;s caravan.  The Government stated that on 1 August  the Council removed from the plot to safe storage goods and personal property that the applicant and his family had failed to take with them.<\/blockquote><p>I predict that sometime soon after the banks have sold on their junk mortgages to the private market, county registrars will be presented with court execution orders to be executed, not a couple of times a month but ten or 12 times a week.  Who is going to pay for this expensive procedure?  The public purse.  Taxpayers will spend millions of euro on evictions.  Does that sound right to the committee?<br\/><br\/>The graph I have reproduced in my statement was taken from the Nevin Economic Research Institute's working paper entitled Ireland's Housing Emergency.  It shows a relatively flat level of repossessions at 150 per quarter until the beginning of 2014, when the figure doubled overnight to in excess of 300.  Why so?  What event caused this change?  I can think of no significant factor that might account for the sudden change other than the sudden arrival of vulture funds into our distressed mortgage mess.  If that is so, one must presume that if the banks are now proposing to finally sell of their huge numbers of deeply indebted loans to the private sector, perhaps increasing the non-bank proportion of non-performing housing loans fivefold from less than 10% to over 50%, we can expect a further significant jump in repossession cases.  There were 41 cases of repossession on Thursday last.  In two years' time, the average list might be 200 per sitting.  On any cost-benefit analysis, this is taxpayers' money down the drain.  It is only a first payment of the many additional bills that must be paid for when the homeless are being provided for.<br\/><br\/>In the paper that I furnished to the committee, I quoted parts of Professor Kenna's book concerning Irish legislation on homelessness.  He sends his apologies for not being able to attend today.  In his book, he made the interesting point that, under the 1998 Act, homelessness was defined as a first step in Irish law to identify the rights of the homeless in order to underpin them with some legal protection.  I quoted him on page 3 of my submission.  In his book he said, &quot;the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 creates a new approach to housing need.&quot;, and made the following technical point:<\/p><blockquote>This represented a conceptual shift from the notion of &ldquo;in need of such accommodation&rdquo; of the 1988 Housing Act, thus defining housing need within a new and narrower focus ... The criteria has shifted from the notion of housing need in the universalist or basic needs sense, to the newer eligibility for &ldquo;social housing support.<\/blockquote><p>What he really means is that it is Government or national legislative policy not to cater for the homeless but to start a process of allocating as between different sectors of society.  That involves competing interests and competing claims between different types of homeless persons.  It is alarming to think about the amount of litigation that will proceed on the basis of arguments between different classes of people who claim to have a higher priority for accommodation, even on a temporary basis, than the next group.  The number of cases will start to skyrocket.<br\/><br\/>I have brought with me a copy of a report from the House of Lords in England dated 2 April 2015.  In it, Lady Hale describes a claim by a lady with five children who was told that there was no property available to house her temporarily in Westminster and so she was offered a house in Milton Keynes.  The person concerned challenged the offer and insisted she should be given a place in Westminster or in the next borough down the road.  The case went as far as the Houses of Lords in England and the person won her case.  That is the kind of litigation that we will be faced with if we are going to deal with the housing of the homeless on the basis of allocating scarce resources.  That seems, unavoidably, to be where we stand because we do not have social housing.<br\/><br\/>Is there a will?  An <i>ad hoc<\/i>group behind me has promoted and lobbied this action.  They asked me about it and I told them not to expect the banks to find a solution.  They said there is a will but nobody can suggest a way.  They have turned to their sworn enemy, namely, the grinding wheels of the law and asked whether the law can help sort this out.  I said that the banks are trying to figure out how to sell and the Government is trying to figure out how to buy.  This seems like an opportunity to sit down and do a deal.<\/p><p>A headline in last Wednesday's edition of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>read, &quot;Banks ponder shifting troubled loans off balance sheets as ECB pressure mounts.&quot;  The banks are trying to sell.  The Government or somebody who may be operating off-balance sheet should be buying.<br\/><br\/>There is political consensus, cross-party political will, to secure, as a primary objective of public policy, the retention of families in their homes.  I quoted from both the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael manifestos.  I am sorry but I did not look at the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto.  I also quoted from the action plan put forward by the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney where he proposed, at page 49, that we should ask the NTMA to examine the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle that could be capable of facilitating investment in social housing in such a way that does not impact on the general government balance.  On the same page, it is stated, &quot;If significant [changes] in respect of both the commerciality and the on-\/off-balance sheet treatment of such a vehicle can be addressed satisfactorily, the objective is to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) by early 2017 to acquire properties&quot;.  I am not sure what progress has been made on that proposal.  It is obvious, however, that progress needs to be made.<br\/><br\/>My proposal is simple.  Believe it or not, it involves a small rejigging of the position of the possession order as between the mortgager and mortgagee - as between foreclosure and redemption - so that those in occupation of the premises will be allowed possession pending sale.  So, they have lost the right to live there, the place is going on the market, the place will be sold, there will be a date for the completion of the sale and, at that point, they will be obliged to quit.  They will not be evicted until the property is actually required by the new owner.  People may think that does not get them very far.  It will., however, because it bridges over that period between the bank deciding to sell and a purchaser, in the form of a co-op, emerging on the scene and saying they are going to buy.  If the co-op buys, then those who are occupying the premises remain in possession and their new status can be negotiated.  The possession pending sale is the key relief proposed in the Bill in regard to the occupants, and that includes tenants.<br\/><br\/>The other feature of the proposal is what I like to call the &quot;non-compulsory purchase order&quot;.  The phrase occurred to me as encapsulating, very clearly, the fact that it is quite obvious that banks want to sell.  If they want to sell, we will buy.  If they do not want to sell, we will not buy.  We are not going to compel them to sell.  We are not going to compel them to become landlords.  We are simply saying that if they are going to sell then they must give the co-op a put-and-call option.  In effect, we have first dibs.  We say, &quot;Okay, that property is on the market.  We are now entitled under law to make you an offer.&quot;  The offer, unfortunately, would not be not a very generous one.  Under the Bill as drafted, the offer is the value of the property currently on the balance sheet of the vendor.  I am sure that is rather disturbing news for banks because they will say they have written down the value to very little.  I will say:<\/p><blockquote>Yes, you have and you have got the tax breaks accordingly so you have now got to face up to whether or not you want to accept this offer, which is basically to take it off your balance sheet and put into the balance sheet cash to the same value that is in the balance sheet or refuse the offer.  You are quite entitled to refuse the offer.  If you want to refuse the offer, then the property will be sold in a fair market either by means of a compulsory purchase order or an order for sale pursuant to court supervision.<\/blockquote><p>Why reinvent the wheel?  As I have said, we have legislation relating to co-ops since 1893.  The mutuality of membership adds immeasurably to the feeling of community solidarity.  Not only that, but it is a model tried and tested worldwide.  I have discovered astonishing information on the housing co-operative movement around the world.  There are housing co-operatives in Pakistan.  The total housing stock in that country is 19 million units, with the figure for co-operative housing stock standing at 2 million.<br\/><br\/>In Germany, and these are the people who are going to be telling us about our balance sheet and EUROSTAT statistics, 30% of all rental housing is controlled or managed by 1,800 housing co-operatives that is comprised of 6 million housing units.  These are people who I think would understand that if one goes to Brussels and says, &quot;We want to put some public money into a co-op system.&quot;  They would say, &quot;But sure, why did you not ask us before?&quot;  We would reply, &quot;Oh, we had to ring Timothy Geithner.&quot;  The latter is now off the scene.<\/p><p>We now go to Brussels and say &quot;The co-op system is the way to build social housing from here on.&quot;  We do not actually go out with the local authorities and build; we create co-ops.  They create working communities that assist one another and survive market forces.<br\/><br\/>It is shameful, given Ireland's history of remarkable land reforms at the turn of the 19th century, that we should now think that new ideas might be too complicated.  Were they smarter legislators back then?  No, but they kept amending and improving until they got it right.  By my count, the Oireachtas has already amended the codifying Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 four times, on each occasion, changing the law about mortgages.  <i>Cui bono<\/i>?  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The Oireachtas should change it again and get it right this time.<br\/><br\/>Here is an interesting historical fact: Ireland's land reforms had a head start on Scotland's.  We had the Great Famine.  In 1848, shocked by reports of &quot;wholesale evictions on Christmas Day, by the universal practice of unroofing peasants' cottages and by the crowds of starving and helpless families seeking union relief&quot;, the House of Commons took action.  Chief Baron Palles said, &quot;These facts were then well-known to parliament&quot;.  Parliament banned them.  He mentioned the name of the relevant case and added &quot;I am myself old enough to remember the names of two towns in the south of Ireland - 'Schull' and 'Skibbereen' - being used in general conversation as places typical of the worst horrors of the famine&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The good news is none of the 60 persons I named at the outset will be evicted next December 25 but who here can be confident they will not be evicted the following week?  Members are the gatekeepers of legislation.  They should not pass the buck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Edmund Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2618,"content":"<p>Mr. Honohan has been direct as usual.

This is critically based upon the following hypothesis.  The co-operative will be able to borrow this money at less than 2%, which is currently available for 20-year fixed interest money.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, raised 20-year money earlier this year at 1.75%.  It follows that given the level of security cover and given the cashflow that will come from a revision of the arrangements with approximately 60,000 customers, this proposition will be self-funding in a very short period.  It will not be a burden on the State and will not have any fall back on it.<\/p> <p>  Internationally there are many examples where this type of transaction has been done numerous times.  All we are dealing with is simple financial engineering.  That is all.  There is no rocket science to this and it is straightforward.  It is so simple that it has surprised me for years that this has not been done already to solve this awful problem.  The way I see this situation, very simply as someone who is retired and on the sidelines, is that almost 300,000 people who are directly involved in these 60,000 houses face the real danger of being evicted and of having their properties repossessed from them unless politicians collectively deal with it.

We have to deal with it urgently now.  <\/p> <p>  I brought this up several years ago with the then Minister for Finance and I was told that we cannot borrow any more money.  That was the sum total of the response.  I am saying in this proposal today that the Minister for Finance does not have to borrow any money.  This money - the world and Europe are awash with cheap money - can be funded if there is a will in these Houses to go and slightly alter the rules for the European Investment Fund, and we will be pushing, I believe, an open door.  Mr. Martin Schulz, who was the President of the European Parliament until 2016 and is now head of the main opposition party in Germany, together with the current President of France, were proposing the alterations that we need to get through the system that would facilitate the raising of a guarantee by that organisation to support the co-op in its venture, therefore guaranteeing that it would be off-balance sheet, which was the main concern of many people in these Houses, as I understand it.<\/p><p>That will solve the major financial problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2668,"content":"<p>The issue of being on or off-balance sheet is important because of the quantum of money involved.

There has been a sense that the mortgage arrears crisis is sorting itself out and that we have seen a decline in the number of people in mortgage arrears.  However, either there is not an understanding or a failure to see that there has been a relatively low level of repossession up to this point and the banks have made decisions to hold off on that.  We have seen an increase in the amount of mortgages that are held by vulture funds or non-bank entities from &euro;2 billion to &euro;6 billion.  However, that situation is going to change in terms of repossessions.  Last year there were almost 1,600 home repossessions, which was a significant increase on previous years.  What we are likely to see is a further increase.  In a sense, we think the mortgage arrears crisis is sorting itself out but in actual fact what we will see is an acceleration of repossessions.  If we add that to the already 60 to 70 families becoming homeless each month, and the wider lack of supply of social housing, unless something radical is done very quickly the current housing crisis will get much worse.  While the exact details of whether this is off-balance sheet or how it might be set up need to be worked out as we go on the necessity of a radical intervention is really important.

To be evicted from one's home and to go into homelessness is a life-changing experience.  I meet many such people.  Many of those who are becoming homeless today never for one moment in their lives thought they would be in this situation.  Parents tell me there is a stigma attached to being homeless.  The general perception is that if one is homeless there must be something wrong with one and that stigma descends on everybody who becomes homeless.  Parents tell me they feel ashamed at having to admit they are homeless.  Schoolchildren will not admit to their friends that they are homeless for fear they are going to be slagged.  Parents tell me they feel they are bad parents, that they have failed their children.<\/p> <p>  To become homeless is an extraordinary life-changing event for many people.  It has permanent repercussions on the children.  If children are left homeless and living in an hotel room, which many of them are for 12 or 18 months, they are damaged psychologically, emotionally and educationally.  That educational damage may never be repaired.  They are damaged educationally because they are stressed out and one cannot go into school stressed out and give one's attention to studying.  For me, this is the issue of the next decade.<\/p> <p>  Homelessness is already out of control.  The Government does not know what to do about it.  The only plan in town is Rebuilding Ireland and it clearly is not working.  It is 11 months since Rebuilding Ireland was launched and every single month the number of homeless people has gone up.  Last year, 2016, there were approximately 1,000 extra homeless households compared with the number at the beginning of the year but that masks the reality because last year, 3,000 homeless households exited out of homelessness.  In reality, therefore, 4,000 households became homeless last year.  I agree that if these repossessions take place we are going to have a tsunami of homelessness.<\/p><p>That is going to come down the road and it is going to be extraordinarily damaging to those people who have to face the prospect of becoming homeless.  The State will not be able to cope.  We will see whole families living on the street if these repossessions take place.  I understand that there are 50,000 mortgages in arrears of more than two years.  That number has barely shifted over the last few years.  The banks themselves estimate that many of those will be repossessed under the present conditions.

That is how this proposition can be funded entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#KK01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2715,"content":"<p>Is there any precedent elsewhere of the European Investment Fund providing a guarantee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#KK01200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497963600,"counter":2716,"content":"<p>The European Investment Fund has already provided guarantees to the tune of over &euro;50 billion.

That is approximately &euro;119,000 each.  Let us assume, being pessimistic, that we borrow at 4%, that is &euro;5 per &euro;1,000.  If I was a bit younger and bought a 30 year term in the morning that is what I would pay.  That would cost me &euro;595 a month.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme for Dublin is approximately &euro;1,250 a month for a two bed dwelling.  This proposal offers the possibility on a very large scale of purchasing State-aided housing at half the current price of HAP.  That would save a considerable amount of cash.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank confirmed that there are approximately 33,000 homes in arrears of two years or more.  The Rebuilding Ireland target is 32,000 rental units as \"social solutions\" over the next five years.  Of the 47,000 target, 32,000 are rentals, either long-term leased part fee or social rental units.  In a really crude cost-benefit analysis the structure being proposed here could alleviate the tsunami of difficulties we are talking about and deliver the entire Rebuilding Ireland target for probably half the budget in a short time.<\/p> <p>  To put the numbers in context, we hear about one in ten mortgage arrears, 73,000 homes in arrears in total.  In Dublin there are 1,300 rental properties and, according to the last DAFT report, there are 3,100 in the country.  If even 10% of the 14,367 buy-to-let mortgages that are in arrears for two years or longer hit the market in any year they will probably be sold with vacant possession to try to increase their value.  A total of 1,500 tenants will be put out for a temporary period of six months.  Given how few rental properties there are, that has the capacity to completely distort the rental market, particularly in Dublin.  This will have an enormous effect.  This is not hundreds of thousands of repossessions, it is relatively few repossessions that are half the total rental stock at the moment.  It is a real immediate problem.<\/p> <p>  We know from accurate indicators that we are losing houses year on year because our new build levels are so low.  We built approximately 3,500 new homes last year in total and 553 of those were ghost estate units that had started in 2010 and were completed.  Last year we lost approximately 950 homes in terms of our overall totals to stock.  In the past two years it was 2,750, taking other accurate indicators.  Our supply of houses is pretty well flat.  We know that from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We have a very small pool of rental properties and there are 33,000 houses of borrowers who have been in distress for two years or longer and 14,000 are buy to lets.  Even in this room we said we were talking only about people and their homes.  The buy to let arrears are probably the biggest single danger to the rental market at present.  These could easily be funded.<\/p> <p>  On the one hand, there is a mechanism, whether it is an EU bond or off or on balance sheet.  In 2013 the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, introduced the concept of a bond in conjunction with Focus Ireland and Key Capital.  It was secured.  The State agreed to relinquish first charge on existing State-owned homes.<\/p><p>The bond was floated at &euro;39 million in Ireland.  That was too low.  Five lenders were approached.  It never flew.  That bond is in a drawer.  It could be taken out and a zero or two could be added, the name could be changed from the name of the special purpose vehicle, SPV that was there, and it could be floated and funded for 4% or 5%.  The structure is very similar to the structure in this proposal.  I thought it was the same thing when I read this.  The international bond market is looking for bonds in excess of &euro;200 million.  They do not want small ones.  A &euro;1 billion bond is great.  There is plenty of juice in there for all the bond guys, the average cost for a tenant to rent a house here would be &euro;600 or &euro;700 a month and nobody loses out.  There is a really compelling financial argument for this.  We know that the numbers stack up in terms of its funding itself.  We are buying at a huge discount which has already been written down.  The only difference is that the co-op, not a private offshore fund, gets the benefit of the write down.  The question for me is not whether this will fly financially but how will those profits be refloated or returned to the economy in the most efficient way possible, for example, funding new social housing or Part V housing.  This is a complete no-brainer in terms of the immediate pressures on the rental sector from a relatively small number of repossessions to the benefits and the actual cost to tenants and people in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maoil&iacute;osa Reynolds","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2725,"content":"<p>Could I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062000002#MM00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1497963600,"counter":2726,"content":"<p>No.  I have to interrupt the witness because we are over time.
