I am raising an interesting issue that has come to light recently.  I am asking the Minister for Education and Skills to recognise inequities that are arising for Galway second level students where both dyslexia and a language exemption co-exist.  This problem is particularly affecting girls.  It seems from a survey that has been done - I can read out the names of the schools involved - that no girls school in Galway allows these students to access six subjects in the leaving certificate examination in order that they can achieve the maximum number of points in that examination.  I am seeking a solution to this problem, which was first brought to my attention by a family living in Corrandulla, a small rural village approximately ten miles outside Galway city.  A daughter in this family was diagnosed with dyslexia and giftedness in 2009.  She got As and Bs in her junior certificate.  She is a high performer in State examinations.  She was exempted from Irish and foreign languages from first year onwards.  She did her best to learn French, but the complexity of her dyslexia in that area made it impossible for her to do so.<\/p> <p>This student's school has informed her that she will still be able to get her six subjects for her leaving certificate.  When the language choices are excluded, however, six subjects are not available to her.  She can do English and mathematics.  She cannot do Irish, French and German because they are the areas from which her dyslexia exempts her.  She has tried her best to learn them, but she is unable to do so.  She can do three other subjects in the science area, in which she excels.  That brings her up to five.  She can also do the leaving certificate vocational programme, but the maximum number of points one can get from that programme is 70.  This means the maximum number of points that this gifted kid can get in her leaving certificate is 570.  I have met her and her family.  She is looking to achieve 100%, which is 600 points plus the bonus points for mathematics, if necessary.  No school in Galway will offer her that opportunity.  When she did a survey, she found that the only school in Galway which offers leaving certificate students the option of doing six subjects without having to do a language to achieve maximum points is St. Jarlath's College in Tuam.  As it is a boys school, obviously she cannot go there.<\/p> <p>This issue applies to this child and to other children.  Her options do not fit with the criteria required for universities in this country.  She cannot access six subjects with an opportunity to get 100 points in each.  When members of her family queried this problem with the principal in her school, she was told she would sit in study for the spare classes and she would have to finance a tutor to do the extra subject privately.  They came across the same issue when they approached other schools.  Most of the schools approached make their students take a foreign language at pass level, which allows them to access a maximum of 60 points for that subject, or facilitate them in taking an additional subject privately.  This child is being home tutored at the moment.  I want to keep stressing that she is a gifted high achiever.  She does not see the point in sitting out so many classes in school.  She is getting help at home at the moment, but it is not an ideal situation.<\/p> <p>A comprehensive survey was done of Presentation College in Tuam; St. Jarlath's College in Tuam, which is the boys school I mentioned; the Mercy Secondary School in Tuam; McHale College in Tuam; Presentation College in Headford; Calasanctius College in Oranmore; the Jesuit school in Galway; St. Enda's College in Galway; Salerno Secondary School in Galway; Taylor's Hill college in Galway; the Presentation Secondary School in Galway; Mercy College in Galway, St. Mary's College in Galway; St. Joseph's College in Galway; Presentation College Athenry; and Athenry VEC.  The only one of those schools that offers this opportunity to its students is a boys school.  Consequently, the conclusion to be reached is that girls with dyslexia are not treated fairly or equally.  There is no equity when it comes to the availability of six subjects at leaving certificate level, which would enable students to try to get maximum points.  The leaving certificate vocational programme is available but, as I have said, it does not allow her to get more than 70 points.  I would like to come to the solution.  It was said to me quite recently that the problem is that an increasing number of children are getting a diagnosis that allows them to be exempted from languages.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is causing a knock-on effect, and schools that have experienced a cut in resources have not realised the implications this has on students' entry to third level because they think the LCVP will cover the gap.  The solution is that one school in a central location such as Galway city should be assigned to offer additional subject for children with dyslexia who are exempted from languages.  That is the best solution, because otherwise there is not equal access for all children, particularly girls.  There is only one school in County Galway which is based in Tuam, that can meet this gap.  It is St. Jarlath's, which is an all-boys' school.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#B00400","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to outline to the House the position on teaching resources for post-primary schools.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, could not attend and she sends her apologies.  I am happy to give feedback on her behalf.<\/p> <p>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school management annually and are available on the Department's website.  The teacher allocation for all schools includes provision for the learning and language support needs of the pupils in them.  I recognise that teacher allocations set the parameters in respect to the number of subjects on offer in schools.  However, the deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and, ultimately, the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.  Sharing arrangements between post-primary schools can help to ensure the range of subjects available to pupils is maximised.  The Senator suggested one school for this.  I am not sure whether the schools to which she referred have explored the option of sharing resources but the option is open to them.  This, however, is usually co-ordinated at school level and it is not dictated to them by the Department.<\/p> <p>If schools have difficulties with providing individual subjects - for example, because of the retirement of a teacher in one of the subjects concerned, short-term support is provided through the curricular concessions process to enable them to meet their curricular needs.  The detail of this process is set out with the criteria for the allocation of posts and is also available on the Department website.  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that additional teaching resources have been provided to schools to cater for increased demographics and also to provide for pupils with special needs.  During the past two years, teacher numbers have increased by approximately 2,300.  Budget 2015 includes provision for 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs in our schools in the coming school year.  This is a significant investment at a time of scarce resources.  The challenge for all our schools is to maximise what is achieved with the resources that are provided to them and to cover as many subjects as possible.  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are experiencing economic growth.  A continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools, which could bring about an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, class size, support for classroom teachers and increased subject choice.<\/p> <p>While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching, which shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations. The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system, which the Senator has raised in the House on many occasions.  We are determined that education should be prioritised for investment as the recovery in our economy strengthens.<\/p> <p>Subject choice is up to each school locally.  Perhaps the Senator might inquire if they have communicated among themselves to provide a solution.  I will raise the issue with the Minister and pass on the solution she has suggested as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#C00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's reply was general and it was not specific to the case.

The Minister of State may be aware that in December 2014, an NUIG academic, Dr. Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, won an Equality Tribunal case against the university for discrimination on the basis of gender in the 2009 round of promotions to senior lecturer.  Dr. Sheehy Skeffington is the first female academic to have achieved this outcome in Ireland.<\/p> <p>One of the consequences of the case was the establishment of a task force to deal with gender equality in the university.  Since then, the university's hiring policies and general staff promotion systems have come under scrutiny, which has been warranted, and many staff and students as well as the trade union are deeply dissatisfied and concerned about how the newly-convened task force will function.  SIPTU, for example, has advised its members on the NUI Galway campus not to co-operate with the task force as it has not engaged in consultations about its establishment.  The trade union went as far as describing the task force as \"an effort to waste time in the hope that the issue will blow over, and with the expectation that the results from their handpicked panel will, in all essentials, be a whitewash\".<\/p> <p>Among SIPTU's concerns, which are echoed by Dr. Sheehy Skeffington and her many supporters among the staff and students of NUI Galway, are that the task force lacks transparency and was not independently constituted and that no assurances have been given with regard to confidentiality.  This lack of buy-in by those who are close to the issue raises serious questions about the suitability of the task force as it stands.  While I have no doubt that all parties to the problem wish to see it resolved, the issue has been greatly exacerbated by the decision, as reported in a local Galway newspaper, by the chair of the governing body of NUI Galway to decline to meet elected representatives and Oireachtas Members to discuss their concerns about gender equality issues at the university. <\/p> <p>Despite everything that has gone before, I welcome the recent remarks made by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in which she asserted that proper consultation between concerned parties is required if the task force is to be effective.  I hope that in the event that NUI Galway fails to address the concerns of many people regarding the effectiveness of the task force, the Minister will continue to exert her influence in the matter.<\/p> <p>On the issue of gender discrimination, it is clear that a cultural change is needed in NUI Galway and perhaps across the third level sector.  To change this culture, we must face up to it, however awkward it may be to do so.  An ineffectual and unrepresentative task force at this juncture will simply kick the can further down the road.  All of the women at NUI Galway, both former and current and including academics, students and support staff, as well as women across the third level sector deserve equality of opportunity, no more and certainly no less.  They have waited for long enough and deserve positive and determined action on this issue.<\/p> <p>The Minister must give a commitment that she will continue to exert her influence on this critical matter in NUI Galway in respect of procedures.  If we do not have faith in promotional opportunities and procedures at a third level institution, it will be a sad reflection on the students who come forward in years to come. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#D00400","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this issue.  The Minister apologises as she could not be present for this discussion.  I acknowledge the serious shortcomings identified by the Equality Tribunal in its ruling last November.  Discrimination against women in the workplace is unacceptable in any setting and the issues brought to light in the case in question are of serious concern to me and the Minister.  For this reason, we have welcomed the response of NUI Galway in unreservedly accepting the ruling of the tribunal and establishing a task force to address related issues.  The membership of the task force, which I understand met for the first time at the end of March, has the breadth of experience and expertise required to allow it to comprehensively examine all of the issues involved.  It is now the responsibility of NUI Galway to engage with the student body and staff to ensure the task force has the broadest possible support for its important work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Senator stated that is not the case and that there is not broad support for it.  We have to address that, and we must get buy-in from all parties on this if its work is to be successful in the long term.  Furthermore, we are satisfied that the ability of the task force to set its own terms of reference, and to operate independently of the management of the university, will allow it to provide strong and insightful advice on policies and practices relating to gender equality issues directly to the university's governing authority.<br\/><br\/>The requirement for gender equality is well-established in legislation.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has a specific legislative role in &quot;promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education&quot;.  The Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 require our higher education institutions to promote gender balance and equality of opportunity among students and staff, and to prepare and implement statements of policy in respect of equality, including gender equality, across all of their activities.  The HEA has a role in reviewing these policies across the higher education sector and is keeping the situation in NUI Galway under review.<br\/><br\/>More broadly, and as the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, noted in a previous discussion on this issue here in the Seanad on 10 March, the Higher Education Authority is actively considering how best to support the improvement of gender equality across the Irish higher education system as a whole and is developing a database of staff employed in the sector so that we can ensure gender equality at all levels within the academic profession in Ireland becomes a reality.<br\/><br\/>The data shows that here in Ireland women represent 43% of academic staff in the universities and institutes of technology but only 21% of professors and associate professors in universities are female.  It is clear, therefore, that ensuring the fair representation and career progression of female academics is an issue which needs to be addressed.  However, we also know that this is not a problem that is unique to Ireland.  The European Commission's 2012 report, Gender in Research and Innovation,<i><\/i>showed that across the EU member states, women represented only 20% of professorial staff.  That is often a subject of discussion at our European Council meetings also.  It is being recognised across Europe that it is an issue that must be addressed, and it will be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to acknowledge the positive role that initiatives such as the Athena Swan charter can play in ensuring that women receive the recognition they deserve in our higher education institutions and I am very pleased that all seven universities and 14 institutes of technology have signed up to this important initiative.<br\/><br\/>Returning to the particular situation in NUI Galway, I would urge all of the relevant stakeholders, including staff, the students and the unions, to engage as constructively as possible with the task force to ensure that it can succeed in its important work.  The Senator stressed that there is not that co-operation.  That is something we have to try to work on, and we might consult with her on that also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#D00500","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer.

For the same 4% level of contribution, those in class A get jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, health and safety benefit, invalidity pension, widow, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension, guardian's payment, contributory State pension, treatment benefit, occupational injuries benefit, carer's benefit and access to schemes such as the community employment scheme, having served their community and, perhaps, not been re-elected.  The disparity between the two groups could not be more stark.  It is a case of everything versus nothing at all.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of the historical development of this situation and that up to 2011, officeholders, including Members of this House, did not have to pay PRSI.  I am also aware that the Social Insurance Fund currently has a significant shortfall in income compared with expenditure and therefore I believe that the widening of the social insurance net to include officeholders is welcome and fair.  However, it is both unwelcome and unfair that those new contributors do not get any benefit from their contributions.  It is discriminatory and flies in the face of everything we hold true about equality and justice.<br\/><br\/>The Minister may argue that the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that there are two categories of persons who are compulsorily insured - employed contributors and self-employed contributors - and that councillors are neither.  They do not have a contract of employment and what is generally understood as a master-servant relationship where the worker is subject to direction, control and dismissal, but neither are they self-employed.  They have a unique status as public representatives, but why should they be penalised for being so?<br\/><br\/>I am not alone in expressing these views.  In 2011, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar told the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>newspaper that he believed it was always wrong that politicians did not pay PRSI and that he had no difficulty with paying it.  However, he went on to state: &quot;[I]t&rsquo;s unfair that there is no benefit accruing.  There are many different classes of PRSI, but we are now the only ones who pay and get nothing back.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In explaining the Government's decision to include officeholders in the PRSI scheme, the former Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, cited the solidarity principle of the Social Insurance Fund as a reason.  According to internationally and nationally accepted definitions, the solidarity principle stems directly from the recognition of the individual's right to social security protection.  The principle of solidarity is what justifies the existence of social security schemes in the first place and ensures that most vulnerable categories of citizens enjoy access to the social protection they require.  However, while officeholders are upholding their side of the solidarity principle by paying 4% PRSI, the State is not upholding its side of the same principle because the charge will not generate any subsequent benefit entitlement.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, speaking at the launch in September 2012 of the 2010 actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, stated:<blockquote>A core principle of sustainable social insurance systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.  I am very pleased that the philosophy of social insurance which is based on solidarity continues to hold true.<\/blockquote>Sadly, in the case of city and county councillors, this does not hold true.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, went on to state, &quot;Social insurance offers excellent value for those on lower incomes, people with shorter working lives&quot;.  It might be worth pointing out here that quite a number of councillors are now unemployed or are stay-at-home housewives or house husbands, having devoted their entire lives to their councils.  We must remember that the solidarity principle applies not only to those on low income but also to all those who, through the occurrence of social risks, lose a substantial portion of their earning capacities.<br\/><br\/>As politicians we all will be aware-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#E00600","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Chair has been generous to Senator Craughwell on an issue that is close to my heart and which I fully support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#F00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Excellent.

Their job as a city or county councillor is their sole occupation.<\/p><p>Following the passing of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, councillors with an enlarged workload and extended electoral areas now spend even more time fulfilling their public office obligations, leaving less time for other paid employment.  Most councillors make a lifetime commitment to the people they represent and are elected for many decades of their working lives.<\/p><p>In return for this and the PRSI they pay, they will never get anything back.  We use the phrase &ldquo;a career in politics\" but who would want a career outside the protections of the Social Insurance Fund while contributing throughout that career to it?  This exclusion is particularly relevant in the context of changes to the national pensions framework.  We all know the qualifying conditions for State pensions include a standardisation in the State pension age at 66.  Some councillors of 66 years of age are still paying 4% in PRSI.<\/p><p>Where will this leave councillors of the present and future who, having contributed for their entire career, will have no pension entitlements?  Christy Burke, Lord Mayor of Dublin, with over 30 years&rsquo; service, will have nothing to show for it.  Where does it leave those who take extended career breaks to take up mayoral or cathaoirleach positions in local authorities?  Where will it leave those who find themselves unemployed following elections?  Where will it leave women who are encouraged to enter politics in increasing numbers?  It is a well-documented fact that women are traditionally known to have reduced contributions due to time spent at home caring for children.  Women are now being disadvantaged as councillors as their time spent in the service to the public will not help them to accumulate one single PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>The argument can be put forward that a gratuity is provided for when councillors reach the age of 50.  This, however, does not provide for them for the rest of their lives in the way a contributory pension does.  When I recently attended a 1916 commemoration event, I was reminded again that the Proclamation declared, \"The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens\".  Elected members of local authorities are not only citizens.  They are also citizens who devote hundreds of hours every week in service of their electorate and communities.  By ensuring democratic accountability, encouraging active citizenship and developing valuable local services, city and county councillors provide the cornerstone for our democratic State.  Discrimination against them is blatant and unnecessary.<\/p><p>Today, I appeal to the Minister of State, on behalf of all officeholders, particularly on behalf of our hardworking and dedicated city and county councillors, to revisit this issue and to address it as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#F00300","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue of which I am very much aware, having served on Dublin City Council for many years.  I have also had extensive engagement on this issue with Senator Denis Landy and Dublin City Councillors Mary Freehill and Dermot Lacey, who is in the Gallery.  It is not a popular subject to raise and I compliment the Senator on raising it.  He certainly will not get any brownie points with the public for raising this important issue.<\/p> <p>Many councillors who work full-time for their constituents will be severely disadvantaged when they reach retirement age because they have not picked up enough contributions for their pension fund.  I accept the gratuity in itself does not compensate for the hours of dedication and work they have given.  Not many people in the public would understand the long hours put in by councillors, especially if one represents a disadvantaged area.  One very much becomes a full-time advocate for the people one represents, often in difficult circumstances.  I am glad the Senator pointed out that what is not often understood by the general public is that some councillors are financially disadvantaged by representing people in their area because they come from higher paid jobs in the private sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Even councillors who work full-time give up career opportunities such as promotions.  What person working in the private sector would give somebody a promotion knowing that person works long hours representing the people?  Other councillors feel duty-bound when elected and by no means see it as an advancement.  They are dedicated and want to work in local government.  It would be very difficult to live on a full-time salary of &euro;16,000 plus.  I have had several meetings with different groups in this regard and I wish I could report progress but I have not made much.  The Senator knows me long enough to know that I say it as I see it.<\/p><p>Some of the following issues have been touched on by the Senator.  City and county councillors are regarded as public officeholders for the purpose of charging PRSI.  They are not employees and are not subject to the contribution applying to employees.  PRSI charges on officeholders were introduced in budget 2011 and apply to public officers such as the President, Members of the both Houses, the Judiciary, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and city and county councillors.  There is a very big difference between the salaries paid to the first group I mentioned and city and county councillors.   From 1 January 2011, public officeholders pay PRSI on their incomes at the class K rate of 4%, providing their income exceeds &euro;5,200.  This is &euro;100 per week, which is not an awful lot.  All public officeholders are liable to pay the contribution, regardless of age.  People with incomes of less than &euro;100 per week do not pay PRSI and return their income under the PRSI class M stamp.  PRSI payments by officeholders do not contribute towards establishing social insurance entitlements prior to 2011.  All officeholders were exempt from PRSI on income received in their capacity as officeholders, which the Senator outlined in his contribution.  The income and consequential pension and retirement gratuities paid to officeholders are funded by the Exchequer.  The PRSI charges on officeholders' income were introduced as a measure of solidarity.  It was seen that public representatives from the very high to the very low would take an income hit and this is what happened.<\/p><p>City and county councillors may establish an entitlement to social security benefits based on non-council related activities.  Many councillors have their own businesses or are able to stay in employment and they keep their entitlement.  However, as the Senator outlined, a number of councillors work full-time and are, therefore, not entitled to these benefits after many years of service.  The public does not appreciate the sacrifices many county and city councillors make.  It is certainly not for financial advancement.  During my time on local authorities, I did not meet many wealthy councillors.  They do it because of their dedication to the community.  They often enter politics and local authorities through community activities and want to make their communities better.  <\/p><p>There is a voluntary contribution system that helps in respect of pension entitlements and there are quite restrictive limitations.  I participated in that system, which is probably one of the best investments I ever made.  When I became an elected councillor, I read Barry Desmond's biography in which he said that from the time he entered full-time politics, he paid his voluntary contributions which then gave him his entitlement.  This was only to the old age contributory pension and not to any unemployment benefit.  Many councillors from all parties and none have faced extreme financial difficulties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given that their salaries were not high, they had not accumulated savings and found themselves in very severe financial difficulties.

If the Senator wishes to participate in this, I am happy to work with him and see if we can find a solution.  Unfortunately, in many such cases, when one amends the Social Welfare Acts, there are unintended consequences.  Therefore it must be considered very carefully.<\/p><p>I wish I were coming here with good news.  I am not, and I do not want to spread false hope.  I am happy to work with Senators and councillors to see if we can find some kind of solution that does not have unintended consequences.  It must be limited and must target the councillors who are most disadvantaged.  Councillors who can remain in full-time work, have their own businesses or who work in the legal or education sectors are different.  This is a small group that is particularly damaged.  They contribute but receive nothing.  I take the Senator's points and thank him for raising them.

Over the Easter recess I found out that a grand total of five houses have been remediated under the Government scheme, which has been up and running for almost two years and accepting applications for more than 12 months.  At the time I welcomed the scheme as a start, but I stated that it was inadequate and too cumbersome.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, got quite excited on the radio over the Easter break.  I was not being personally critical of him; I just stated that the fact of the matter is the scheme is too slow and that hundreds of thousands of homeowners who require the State's assistance because HomeBond and the quarries were allowed to walk away by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, were left with this scheme, which has fixed five homes.  This is the reality.  We need to debate this and I ask the Leader to schedule time with either the Minister of State or the Minister for a response.  Perhaps he has already done so.

I remind Members that it was the first time in the history of the State that any Government introduced legislation to change a specific private pension scheme to reduce pensions and payments to retired members by six weeks per annum, to reduce long-term deferred members' pensions by up to 60% and, without permission, to transfer existing members to an inferior pension scheme.

It is estimated that approximately 100,000 people turned out in the city centre of Dublin to take part in this commemoration of the social and historical context to the period leading up to the Rising.  It was a most innovative idea to commemorate 1915, the year before the big centenary commemoration next year.  The numbers who turned out and the success of the event show the great public appetite for this sort of commemoration, which emphasises the social and historical aspects and the political context rather than focusing exclusively on the military side.  The military aspect was illustrated by actors on the streets in the uniforms of British soldiers, who would have been on the streets of Dublin in 1915.<\/p><p>We might usefully have another debate in this House in due course on the centenary events for next year and the idea of commemorations more generally.

It is outrageous that when mortgage interest rates go down the bank can decide not to pass it on to its customers, but when mortgage interest rates increase that becomes effective from the following day.<\/p> <p>Second, can we invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the House to address a range of problematic farming issues?  The issue of the young old farmers has not been resolved.  The Department would probably consider them to be old young farmers.  These are young farmers who have put big investments into their farms without any State support.  There is also the problematic issue of digital mapping in rural areas.  In some cases, the digital mapping shows rocky areas on the maps and farmers are being penalised as a result, yet if the inspectors arrive to inspect the area there are sheep grazing on it.  If the farmers decide to appeal the decisions made by the Department, they could wait 12 months to get their single farm payment.  That is wrong.  It is a rural Ireland issue and it is important that the Minister come to the House to deal with these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#R00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Will the Leader schedule a debate on the fair deal scheme and the availability of beds under the nursing homes support scheme, which was put in place a number of years ago?

When the figures are broken down on a constituency basis, many counties have seen a very significant drop in the availability of beds under the scheme.  Obviously, there is a problem and I ask that the Minister for Health be invited to the House to discuss it.  There is also the situation of over 400,000 people waiting on hospital waiting lists.  Many are waiting well over 12 months, even though the Government promised that outpatients would be seen in less than 12 months.  One can see that some departments in hospitals across the State are worse than others, but the figures released recently by the HSE show that a significant number of people are waiting longer than the 12 months that was promised by the Government.

My understanding is that the amount of money recovered from estates, and the fair deal scheme has been up and running since 2009, is approximately &euro;7.5 million over a 12 month period.  That is &euro;7.5 million recovered out of a total of &euro;970 million spent.  I refer to assets, not income.

A pilot study that was recently carried out on accident and emergency units indicated that 30% of people who attended over the weekend could have been adequately treated by GPs rather than attending the accident and emergency unit.  The Department and HSE should examine how to work with GPs to ensure that more people attend their clinics rather than accident and emergency units.  There were over 1.1 million attendances at accident and emergency unit last year, and we must work to reduce pressure on the hospital service.  One way of doing so is to work closely with GPs, which we could deal with in a debate on the next occasion the Minister is in the Chamber.  It is a debate to which we should give serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#R00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429104600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I request the Leader to use his good offices and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to seek the early release of the Irish teenager Ibrahim Halawa, who is being held in jail in Egypt.

The result is that the monthly rental cost of a three-bedroom house in the city is in the region of &euro;853.  In addition to rising rents, particularly in east Galway, there is the problem of the lack of suitable rental accommodation for families.  There are rooms or a small flat here and there to rent but increasingly fewer suitable family homes.  A few days ago I met a young mother in Athenry who burst into tears at her conundrum which is that she and her family have been given notice, and after trying many estate agents, they could not find suitable accommodation.  These are people who are willing to pay good money for accommodation.  As the family have a little dog, she is worried they might have a difficulty in getting accommodation.

My information is that currently there are no plans before the Government on this issue.  The question of the fair deal scheme has been raised by Senator Cullinane and Senator Burke.  I do not know where Senator Cullinane got his figures - he referred to 7,850 people.  As Senator Burke mentioned, a total of 22,000 people are in under the fair deal scheme currently, costing &euro;970 million.  Senator Burke made a good point on the assets that have been recovered to date since 2009, amounting to only &euro;7.5 million.  Certainly, that will have to be looked at in the context of funding.

This is an exciting project similar to the Wild Atlantic Way.  I am informed that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has spent the past year, in consultation with the key stakeholders, working to develop the initiative, which is to include tourism attractions and businesses throughout the region.  Following much consultation and deliberation Ireland's ancient east will be crafted along four distinct thematic pillars: ancient Ireland; early Christian Ireland; medieval Ireland; and Anglo Ireland, including Ireland's great houses and gardens.<\/p> <p>All the area in the east and down in the south east will be covered under this initiative.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's research suggests that an initiative along these thematic lines has the potential to deliver an extra 600,000 overseas visitors, tourism growth of over 20% in the region and an increase in visitor revenue of almost 25%, or &euro;950 million, in total by 2020.  It is an exciting project and I imagine it will have the same success that we witnessed with the Wild Atlantic Way.  I compliment everyone involved in launching this project.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Kelly called for further debate and an update from the Minister for Finance on mortgage interest rates.

He has dealt with old young farmers, as they are called, in the budget and Finance Act.  <\/p><p>I have dealt with the matters raised by Senators Cullinane and Burke.  Senator Burke welcomed the IMO agreement with the Department for GP treatment for children aged under six years.  This will be of great benefit to many hard-pressed families and has been welcomed by the vast majority of GPs.<\/p><p>Senators Leyden and Mullins referred to the Ibrahim Halawa case.  I gave a very comprehensive reply on the matter before the break.  The Irish ambassador in Cairo is monitoring the situation closely and representations have been made to the Egyptian ambassador and authorities on this case.  I can assure the Senators that the Government is doing everything possible to secure the release of the Irish citizen concerned.  <\/p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  He welcomed many of its proposals while disagreeing with others.  He called on the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House.  I can inform him that the Minister will come before the House next Wednesday to discuss the NCSE inclusion support services.  There will be an opportunity at that time and later to discuss matters with her.<\/p><p>It is obvious that Senator Crown enjoyed the break because he has raised five or six matters.  There was disagreement on psychiatric services between the gentleman in question and the HSE.  He was suspended, but has been reinstated.  I understand the dispute concerned staffing in a brand new state-of-the-art facility in Cork.  I am glad he has been reinstated and I hope any differences will be ironed out as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>Senator Crown also referred to burglaries, which I addressed, and asked for them to be classified as crimes against a person rather than property.  They are matters we can discuss with the Minister if she comes before the House to deal with the draft Bill.<\/p><p>On international tobacco companies taking the Government to court regarding the laws we passed on tobacco, the Senator has novel ideas on proscribing such companies.  I am sure all avenues will be addressed and examined by the State in order to defend against such companies.  <\/p><p>Senator Sheahan referred to EU moneys and single farm payments that are paid to men and women with herd numbers.  Their names and addresses are being published and he feels it is a dangerous precedent.  I see his point, especially as we have discussed burglaries in many parts of the country.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and see whether anything can be done.  <\/p><p>Senator Mullen referred to problems in the rental sector and the availability of suitable housing.

A myriad of areas that were not available previously are now open to local authorities as they try to tackle the housing problems that exist in some parts of the country.  Unfortunately, we have an over-supply of houses in some other parts of the country.  I suppose it is contradictory to have major problems in major cities like Galway, Cork and Dublin at a time when there is an over-supply in many rural areas.  Unfortunately, during the boom houses were built in areas where nobody would go and live.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton spoke about the High Court backlog in Galway, especially in relation to personal injuries cases.  She called for more efficient management of these services.  While that is a matter for the Courts Service, I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan mentioned two sportsmen who passed away recently.  Ray Treacy was a great international footballer.  I had the pleasure of seeing him score many goals for Ireland.  Dave Billings was a Dublin all-Ireland footballer.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan also made a point about the danger that drones may cause for air traffic.  He called for more regulation in that regard.  I suggest that if he raises this matter during a Commencement Debate, he might get a comprehensive reply from the Minister.<\/p><p>The final two speakers, Senators Mullins and Noone, spoke about criminal justice matters.  Senator Noone also spoke about the online abuse of female politicians.  I do not think it is confined to female politicians.

This measure will complete the implementation of the budget 2015 package of social protection improvements, which also included increases in child benefit and the living alone allowance which came into effect from the beginning of the year.  This Bill also provides for an extension of the one-parent family payment to lone parents who are eligible for the carer's allowance until their youngest child reaches 16 years of age and an extension of the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements to apply to all lone parents where the youngest child is between the ages of 7 and 13 years.<\/p> <p>All of these improvements have been made possible as a result of the many sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and the difficult choices that have been made by the Government to successfully tackle the unprecedented economic and banking crisis.  This has delivered an economic recovery that is gaining real momentum, and we are now seeing the benefits of this.<\/p> <p>The Exchequer statement for the first quarter of the year confirms the progress that has been made in restoring order to the public finances.  With tax revenues nearly 5.5% ahead of target, this is real evidence of the increase in the number of jobs being created.<\/p> <p>The Central Bank has estimated GDP growth of 4.8% last year, with a further increase of 3.8% this year.  The recovery in the economy has become more balanced over the past year, with the beginning of a recovery in consumer spending, which is showing signs of gradually strengthening.<\/p> <p>The quarterly national household survey figures published earlier in the year show that the number of people in work has increased by 90,000 since we introduced our strategies to create jobs and reduce unemployment.  A particularly welcome aspect of this increase in employment is that it is largely made up of full-time work.  There was an increase of almost 40,000 people working full time last year alone.  Total employment now stands at well over 1.9 million, the highest level in five years.<\/p> <p>The latest live register figures for March show a continued decline in the number of people out of work, as the unemployment rate fell to 10%.  This represents the lowest number of people signing on since February 2009.  Most encouragingly, the latest figures show that the number of long-term unemployed has fallen to just over 160,000, a reduction of nearly 11% in the past year.  However, unemployment remains too high and we still have progress to make in getting people back into employment.<\/p> <p>Helping people return to work is probably the key goal driving everybody in this House.  Having a job is the best protector against poverty and I am particularly encouraged by the fact that the vast majority of people returning to work are returning to full-time jobs.  The longer one is out of work, the harder it is to get back into the workforce.  Every new job for someone who has been out of work is a new future for his or her family and a boost to the community.  The recent quarterly national household survey figures clearly demonstrate the continuing success of the Government's twin-track approach to creating jobs and helping people return to work.<\/p> <p>Pathways to Work is ensuring that as many as possible of those newly-created jobs go to those on the live register, especially those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  Through the provision of return-to-work supports, training and education, those on the live register are ready to avail of the growing number of jobs being created every month.  The Action Plan for Jobs is helping accelerate that transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy.<\/p> <p>The Pathways to Work strategy sets out a comprehensive reform of the State's approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work.  Since its inception in 2012, the Pathways to Work strategy has seen the State's employment and entitlement services being brought together into one-stop shop Intreo centres.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Group information sessions and individual profiling are fully operational in all of the Department's offices.  Last year, the Department provided group information sessions to 186,000 jobseekers, including 56,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers.  It also conducted initial one-to-one guidance interviews with 169,000 jobseekers.<\/p><p>In addition, we have introduced and enhanced a range of schemes and programmes in recent years to assist those out of work.  These include the introduction of the JobsPlus and Gateway programmes, as well as the development of the First Steps youth development initiative and JobsPlus youth programmes which are specifically tailored for young unemployed people.  Since 2012, 62,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers have moved into employment and we are on track to reach our 2015 target of 75,000.<\/p><p>As Minister of State with responsibility for employment, community and social support, I have a particular focus on reducing the number of people out of work for over a year.  In this regard, my Department continually reviews its supports for jobseekers to ensure they do not act as a disincentive to taking up work or increasing the number of hours worked.  The Department's engagement in this area has clearly demonstrated the great majority of social welfare recipients have a strong financial incentive to take up employment, disproving the misconception that one is not financially rewarded for going back to work.  These findings are supported by the work of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which confirms that work pays more than welfare for almost six out of seven unemployed people.  These findings hold true even when in-work costs such as child care and travel to work are taken into account.  This evidence clearly shows if we can create jobs, people will leave the welfare system to take up work.<\/p><p>However, it is reasonable that families who have been struggling while out of work for long periods will be concerned about the potential implications of moving from welfare to work, particularly when they have children.  This is where the back-to-work family dividend comes in.  Put simply, the scheme will allow a family returning to work to retain the child related element of their welfare payment, known as the qualified child increase, for two years.  The dividend will be paid at a standard weekly rate of &euro;29.80 per child, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of &euro;119.20 per week in the first year.  The rate payable in the second year will be half the rate payable in the first year, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of &euro;59.60.  Accordingly, over the two-year payment period, the dividend will be worth &euro;2,324 in the case of a one-child family, &euro;4,649 in the case of a two-child family, &euro;6,973 in the case of a three-child family and &euro;9,298 in the case of a family with four or more children.<\/p><p>This will mean, for example, that with the support provided through the family income supplement and the back-to-work family dividend, a person with a partner and four children who gets a job paying the minimum wage will be better off by some &euro;304 a week, or &euro;15,790 a year, by moving from jobseeker's allowance into employment.  This is a highly progressive policy.  The back-to-work family dividend scheme will operate during the period of economic recovery and will cease to operate with effect from 1 April 2021.  The dividend will be tax free and will be payable in addition to any family income supplement entitlement that the person may have.<\/p><p>Two improvements will be introduced in this Bill to enhance the supports available to lone parents.  The first improvement will extend entitlement to the one-parent family payment to lone parents who are also eligible for the half-rate carer's allowance payment until their youngest child reaches 16 years of age.  This measure acknowledges the special situation and, in particular, the commitment of lone parents who are caring for people other than their own child such as a parent or sibling who requires full-time care and attention.  The one-parent family payment scheme already provides for lone parents who are caring for children under 16 years of age and who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015041500002#DD00400","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429104600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
