A public body has no contractual ties with a subcontractor engaged by a main contractor.  Any contractual relationship is exclusively a matter between the main contractor and its subcontractor.  <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the difficulties being experienced by subcontractors in this current economic climate.  In this regard, my colleague, Minister of State Brian Hayes TD worked with Senator Fergal Quinn earlier this year on the development of the Construction Contracts Bill which was enacted on 29 July 2013 (Construction Contracts Act No 34. 2013).<\/p><p>  The Act seeks to address the issue of non-payment to construction contractors who have completed work on construction contracts by setting minimum standards for the payment provisions in construction contracts (whether the contracts are written or otherwise).  In addition, if a payment dispute arises, then the Act also provides for a swift and cost effective adjudication process.  This will provide a route for subcontractors to achieve redress in the event that non-payment occurs. <\/p><p>  The general issue of policy relating to prompt payments between businesses is a matter for my colleague Mr, Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The rules governing prompt payment have been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).  This legislation acts as a deterrent to late payment by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.  It lays down specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to public or private transactions.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of contractual rights, including any rights and obligations provided for by the Regulations, is a matter for individual suppliers.  If the purchaser refuses to pay prompt\/late payment interest and compensation to the supplier, then the supplier can seek their own legal advice on the matter.  The supplier can also decide not to pursue prompt\/late payment and compensation from a purchaser if he\/she so wishes but is legally entitled to claim where such payment would apply.  I am informed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that the Regulations do not provide for any enforcement role for that Department in respect of these matters.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  This Code which is currently being finalised by the various business representative bodies with the support of  the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is aimed at improving cash flow between businesses and also helping address the culture of late payments in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In addition my colleague, Mr John Perry, TD, Minister for Small Business recently announced a national Late Payment Information Campaign, which will start on the 9th December in Dublin before being rolled out to other parts of the country early in the New Year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100063#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100063#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[49418\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100063#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to address the summer flooding in the Shannon Callows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management Study.

The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin, including the Callows area, subject to meeting environmental and economic cost-benefit criteria.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders toward agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB has agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring\/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding particularly in the Shannon Callows area.

In addition, the OPW provides a guide presence to further enhance the visitor experience and English, French, Italian, Spanish &amp;amp; German guided tours are available throughout the year.  Many commercial tour operators operate day tours to the site and it is a popular destination close to Dublin for international short stay visitors, which remains open all year round.  <\/p><p>  Visitors may freely access the Glendalough site and scenic walks around the lakes without entering through the Visitor Centre and many clearly choose to do this.  The OPW is not in a position to capture data on this traffic but it is certainly significant.  Visitor numbers recorded at the OPW Visitor Centre in 2012 were 79,983; the equivalent number recorded to end September 2013 is 72,033.  It is clear that many multiples of this figure visit the site without visiting the Centre.<\/p><p>  It is evident, given the volume of traffic to Glendalough, that visitors will continue to be attracted in large numbers to this location and the primary focus and challenge to OPW will be to continue to preserve and protect the Monument and present it to the public in a way that ensures that the fabric of the site is not damaged.  The facilities currently available to OPW to fulfil this mandate are adequate for the purpose and there are no immediate plans to develop any further tourist facilities.  However, given the large volume of visitors a number of management issues have arisen in recent years in the vicinity which make it imperative to manage the traffic to the Glendalough site more efficiently.  In this regard, the OPW has engaged with local stakeholders, including Wicklow Co. Council, to focus on issues such as carparking, traffic management and visitor security so as to ensure that the many people who wish to visit Glendalough can continue to do so safely and enjoyably.  OPW will also continue to engage with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ensure that Glendalough is marketed appropriately internationally as a visitor destination and that awareness of the site and its attractions for visitors are presented favourably wherever possible.

The tender documentation seeks to encourage participation on a fair and equal basis by Small and Medium Enterprises (&ldquo;SME&rdquo;s) in this competition.  SMEs that believe the scope of this competition is beyond their technical or business capacity are encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Through such relationships they can participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements that result from this competition and therefore increase their social and economic benefits.  Similarly, larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs can be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from this tendering exercise.<\/p><p>  In a significant change to the previous single supplier contract, this competition has been structured as a multi-supplier framework agreement.  In this case the framework will be broken up into four sectoral groupings (lots) that will be subject to ongoing competition from the participants under the terms of the competition.

While each individual sector has responsibility for the specific arrangements relating to gender equality, my own Department is responsible for gender equality policy in the Civil Service. <\/p><p>  In that context, as can be seen from the table below, significant progress has been made in addressing gaps between male and female participation at different grade levels in the civil service workforce.  For example, as set out in the table, the proportion of women in middle and senior management grades in the civil service, in which even up to fifteen years ago, a relatively low percentage of posts were filled by women, is a strong demonstration of the impact of a number of initiatives which have been implemented to achieve better gender balance.  Indeed the targets included in the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2007-2016 for the percentage of women in the grades of AP and PO in the Civil Service has already been well exceeded for both grades. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note increases in the representation of women in grades that are feeder groups for middle and senior management grades as an important indicator of further increases over time in the number of women in senior positions in the civil service.  Research had previously identified under-representation of women, in particular, in the Assistant Principal grade as a particular obstacle to the advancement of women to more senior levels.<\/p><p>  While there are many factors, both societal and organisation specific, which have contributed to the increase in female participation at higher grades in the Civil Service, a number of specific initiatives have been particularly relevant in a civil service context including:<\/p><p>- The introduction of targets in 2000 aiming to fill <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">one-third of Assistant Principal posts by women.<\/font><\/p><p>- The Gender Equality Policy in the Civil Service which was launched in 2001 which <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">highlighted the need to introduce a modern approach to equality in human resource areas such as recruitment, promotion and training and suggested a number of practical steps which can be taken by Departments to promote equality of opportunity in these areas.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- The <\/font>extensive range of flexible working arrangements available to all civil servants which allows them to balance their work and personal commitments. <\/p><p>  The recent Haddington Road Agreement included some amendments to flexitime and worksharing arrangements.  Work-life balance arrangements in the civil service are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  Civil servants continue to have access to a number of flexible working arrangements, including flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme and career breaks.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress which has been made in increasing the participation of women in the work force, there is clearly a continuing need to promote strategies that continue to increase female participation at senior levels across all sectors of the public service.

Remedying late or non-compliance is preferably achieved through engagement with the taxpayer, but where that engagement is not forthcoming then Revenue will utilise appropriate collection enforcement measures, including referral to Sheriffs, to pursue outstanding tax debts.  Revenue&rsquo;s procedures in relation to collection and enforcement are set out in their Collection Manuals for Revenue staff (these are also available on <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>) and implementation of these procedures are subject to appropriate supervision by officers at various levels to ensure that, before any enforcement action is taken, those procedures have been followed and have been applied appropriately according to the circumstances of any particular case.  It is important to note that all taxpayers who have failed to pay their taxes on time are given adequate opportunities to come to an arrangement with Revenue to pay their taxes over a period, where they face genuine difficulties in paying them in a single amount as due.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the execution of Revenue warrants by Sheriffs in respect of tax debts is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended.  However Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945, and are independent of the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  They may seize whatever goods are necessary to satisfy an outstanding debt.<\/p><p>  Sheriffs are answerable before the Courts for any breach of the civil debt collection code and accordingly are not directly accountable to me or to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the execution of warrants for the collection of tax.  In these circumstances, I am not in a position to comment further on the processes used by sheriffs, training of their staff or legal actions if any taken in relation to the actions of sheriffs.<\/p><p>  As regards further oversight, in addition to being officers of the Court, the Sheriffs are subject to the Data Protection Acts.  I am further advised that the Sheriffs have in place a Code of Practice, available from any sheriff or on Revenue&rsquo;s website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers.  For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized a written inventory will be supplied to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.  The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to propose changes in relation to the provision of the Finance Acts governing tax debt collection and enforcement available to Revenue, as I am satisfied that these are appropriate to the safeguarding of the collection of taxes on behalf of the Exchequer.  I am also satisfied that the procedures Revenue have in place with regard to the use of the legislation are appropriate and strike the right balance in terms of fairness as between the majority of taxpayers who pay their taxes on a timely basis and those who fail to do so.  However, in the Finance Bill which is currently before the House I am proposing to provide for the forfeiture of alcohol products on unlicensed premises where a tax clearance certificate is not in place.<\/p><p>  While detailed information is not available to them, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that the OECD has reported that in a survey of 52 revenue bodies, practically all have available to them powers to arrange the seizure of taxpayers assets to enforce tax debt collection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100064#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100065#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[49855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100065#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is any provision for credit unions against loss; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Under the Credit Union Act 1997 credit unions are required to set aside provisions to deal with expected losses.

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all moneys within it are fungible.  The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances available to the Exchequer at all times. This also helps to provide investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the maturity of debt.   For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external and internal shocks.  In general terms the overall level of cash reserves maintained depends on the amount of liabilities falling due for payment in the short term and the State&rsquo;s risk appetite in relation to such shocks over the longer term. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.<\/p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages the national debt in order to ensure liquidity for the Exchequer. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of cash and related assets to be maintained take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. <\/p><p>  As Ireland returns to funding itself through the debt markets while still running a large though declining budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU\/IMF programme is paramount. The NTMA plans accordingly to have cash on hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014 and the early part of 2015.  The State earns a return on its cash balances and related assets which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.<\/p><p>  Due to the fungibility of the various cash streams flowing into the Exchequer, it is not possible to provide a precise measure of the total cost of maintaining the cash balances in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013.  However,  the NTMA has estimated that the difference between the average rate of interest payable on long-term borrowing and the average rate receivable on cash and related assets was in the range 2.4 to 3.1 percentage points in 2011-2012 and 2.7 percentage points in 2013 to date. The inputs to the cost of long-term borrowing include EU\/IMF programme funds and the bond issuance done by the NTMA during 2012 and 2013<\/p><p>  The NTMA continues to keep the quantum, maturity and timing of market funding under review based on its assessment of what is required to regain full market access and the overall level of cash balances that it is prudent to maintain.

As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">was established on an interim basis in July 2011 and on a statutory basis in December 2012 under the Fiscal Responsibility <\/font>Act 2012. The Act was subsequently amended by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013 to assign it the further function of endorsing the macro-economic forecasts as set out below<font color=\"#000080\">, <\/font>  along with the Council&rsquo;s other functions. These are;<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- To endorse, as it considers appropriate, the macro-economic forecasts prepared by the Department of Finance on which the Budget and Stability Programme Update are based.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- To assess the official forecasts produced by the Department of Finance. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- To assess whether the fiscal stance of the Government is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, with reference to the EU Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- To monitor and assess compliance with the budgetary rule as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The budgetary rule requires that the Government&rsquo;s budget is in surplus or in balance, or is moving at a satisfactory pace towards that position.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- In relation to the budgetary rule, to assess whether any non-compliance is a result of &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo;. This could mean a severe economic downturn and\/or an unusual event outside the control of Government which may have a major impact on the budgetary position.<\/font><\/p><p>  The Fiscal Council&rsquo;s most recent Fiscal Assessment Report published in April 2013, is the only assessment report published since December 2012. In this report the Fiscal Council assessed the fiscal stance as appropriate. In addition, the Fiscal Council set out its views in relation to a wide range of macro-economic and fiscal matters. The key points of relevance to the question are set out below:<\/p><p>  - In chapter 2 on the assessment of Budgetary Forecasts the Council state: <\/p><p>  &quot;While the budgetary outlook has improved, significant macro-economic and public finance risks remain. The Budget 2013 projections assume the delivery of sizable expenditure savings. Achieving these savings, notably in the health sector, will be a key challenge.&quot; <\/p><p>  The position is that the delivery of the required expenditure consolidation in 2013 is a priority for all Ministers and their Departments. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working with all Departments and Offices to monitor voted expenditure. At the end of October 2013, net voted expenditure was &euro;844 million behind profile. This highlights that in aggregate expenditure is being managed well within the targets for the year.<\/p><p>  - In Chapter 3 on the assessment of Compliance with Fiscal Rules, the Council commented: <\/p><p>  &quot;The structural budget balance plays a key part in the domestic and EU fiscal rules. However, this poses serious measurement challenges. These need to be addressed both at EU level and by the development of a more comprehensive domestic analysis.&quot; <\/p><p>  My Department has stated previously that measuring and projecting the structural balance for a small open economy such as Ireland is challenging because it involves unobservable items such as the output gap, the future path of potential GDP and adjusting the deficit for the impact of economic cycle. Structural balance estimates, by their nature, are subject to revision. At EU level, the Commission is investigating alternate model-specifications to improve estimates of the output gap, particularly around turning points in the economic cycle. My Department is working on improving the empirical rigour of its output gap modelling.<\/p><p>  - In chapter 4 on the assessment of the Fiscal Stance, the council stated the following: <\/p><p>  &quot;The suggested margin of safety has therefore been broadly achieved under the Government&rsquo;s current plans and so the Council is no longer making the case for &euro;1.9 billion in additional adjustments in this assessment. However, the Council&rsquo;s assessment is that the planned adjustments of &euro;3.1 billion in 2014 and &euro;2.0 billion in 2015 should not be reduced.&quot;<\/p><p>  The call for an additional &euro;1.9 billion had been made in the September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report. Government considered the proposal taking account of the potential impact additional consolidation could have on economic activity. Given the need to protect the emerging economic recovery, it was decided to stick to the previously announced consolidation strategy. In the intervening period, significant changes occurred, including the restructuring of the promissory note. In relation to Budget 2014, the Government did introduce a budgetary adjustment of &euro;3.1 billion including tax increases and expenditure cuts worth &euro;2.5 billion. Government decided to do this to help ensure a continued return to economic growth while also ensuring that fiscal sustainability was demonstrated by targeting a fiscal deficit below the required limit coupled with a small primary balance.<\/p><p>  - The Council also stated that: <\/p><p>  &quot;Budget-impacting developments will have to be monitored closely, with particular attention paid to any shortfalls in growth and the effective implementation of expenditure-reduction plans.&quot; <\/p><p>  It should be noted that budgetary outturns for both revenue and expenditure are closely monitored by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Outturns for Exchequer revenue and issues are published on the second working day of the following month, thereby ensuring difficulties, if any, will be identified and can be acted upon, if required.<\/p><p>  - Finally the Council stated that: <\/p><p>  &quot;A robust return to State creditworthiness &ndash; which has continued to show the improvement highlighted in the September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report &ndash; would be further reinforced by post-programme precautionary funding arrangements and extensions to the maturities on official loans.&quot; <\/p><p>  The Government decided on 14 November that Ireland is now in the best position to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance on December 15 without the need to prearrange a new precautionary credit line from our EU and IMF partners. Following a careful and thorough assessment of all of the available options, and various consultations with the European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the President and members of the Eurogroup, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA, the decision was taken to exit the programme without a prearranged precautionary facility or backstop. The Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland includes a joint financing package of &euro;85 billion which includes contributions from the EU\/EFSM of &euro;22.5 billion, and from the euro area Member States\/EFSF of &euro;17.7 billion. Agreement in principle was reached at the 12th &ndash; 13th April 2013 informal Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings in Dublin to increase the maximum average maturity of both types of loan by a further 7 years, bringing the total maximum average maturity of the EFSF loans to 22 years, and the EFSM loans to 19.5 years. The 20th - 21st June meetings of Eurogroup and ECOFIN formally approved these extensions. The principal benefits of the maturities extension is the smoothing of our debt redemption profile, the consequent improvement in our ability to fund ourselves in the financial markets and the beneficial impact on our debt sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100066#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100066#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[49963\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100066#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if persons who paid their 2013 local property tax by cash, cheque-postal order or single debit authority and did not receive a LPT1A payment instruction form for 2014 are assumed to be paying by the same methods for 2014, as is the case of those who pay through deduction at source; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under the original Promissory Note arrangement, the Government was scheduled to make annual payments of &euro;3.1 billion thereby putting significant upward pressure on the amounts to be funded from the market.  The provision of these long-term non-amortising Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes has therefore had significant benefits from a market  perspective as it ensures that there will be much less issuance of Irish Government bonds into the market over the next decade and beyond than would otherwise have been the case.    <\/p><p>  Increasing the weighted average life of the debt associated with the funding of IBRC from circa 7-8 years to circa 34-35 years and securing a lower funding cost for the State, result in significant annual interest savings. Combined with the extension of EFSF and EFSM loans, this will result in an estimated reduction of some &euro;40 billion in the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding requirement over the next decade.  It is also expected that there will be a reduction in the underlying General Government deficit of circa &euro;1 billion per annum in the coming years (before transaction costs) reducing the forecast deficit by around 0.6% of GDP annually. Removal of Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short-term borrowings which had to be rolled over on a fortnightly basis was also a significant benefit.<\/p><p>  Bond markets have reacted well to the impact of these and other improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s financial and fiscal position with the result that Irish bond yields are now at historically low levels. The ten-year yield, for example, is currently at around 3.5%, far lower than had been the case before the State entered the EU\/IMF programme. The impact of the announcement in February regarding the Promissory Notes was notable with the yield on the 2025 bond falling by almost half of one per cent (0.5%) in the week following the announcement. Standard and Poor&rsquo;s revised the outlook on Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating to &lsquo;stable&rsquo; on the back of the announcement while Moody&rsquo;s and Fitch Ratings published positive commentaries. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland, which holds the Government bonds that replaced the Promissory Notes, will sell  a minimum of the bonds in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&euro;0.5 billion), 2015-2018 (&euro;0.5 billion per annum), 2019-2023 (&euro;1 billion per annum), 2024 on (&euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold). The schedule of sales takes into account the Central Bank&rsquo;s holding of &euro;3.6 billion of the 2025 bond as a result of the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank.

The deputation put forward the view that the new post-primary school being established in 2014 in the area should be configured, along with the existing post-primary school  into a junior school \/ senior school model rather than as two separate fully vertical schools. <\/p><p>  I fully considered all aspects of this matter and I am of the view that the schools can operate successfully as two vertical schools. I consider this to be the optimum configuration for the two schools and indeed the best provision that can be made for the pupils in the area. <\/p><p>  The patron of the two post-primary schools in question has developed a specific management structure for the new educational campus that will be constituted.  In this regard, it is proposed that a single Governing Authority be established in order to guarantee to Parents\/Guardians and Students a fair and equitable enrolment policy for both schools and to ensure that the overall management of the campus would be as cohesive and effective as possible.  The Governing Authority will be representative of the stakeholders from both schools together with members of the patron body and will be under an independent Chairperson. This authority would be established under the provisions of the Education and Training Board Act 2013.  Apart from the management of campus facilities, one of the key core functions of the Governing authority will be to develop and co-ordinate the overarching enrolment policy for both schools, following appropriate consultation with the respective Boards of Management of both schools and ensure that the policy is in keeping with the Education and Training Board policy and Department guidelines. This function does not supersede the powers conferred under the Education Act 1998 to the Boards of Managements of the individual schools.<\/p><p>In addition to the establishment of the single Governing Authority, the Patron will establish a Board of Management for each school. The functions of the Schools and the Boards of Management are those described under the Education Act 1998.<\/p><p>The pooling of resources of the two schools would mean the provision of the widest possible range of subjects for the pupils in both schools.  This will be particularly important during the initial years of the establishment of the new post-primary school and during the downsizing of the existing  school.   By pooling the pupils from both schools, it will also be possible to offer a subject in one school where the demand from both schools would bring the class size to a viable number.  It is envisaged that both schools will each cater for up to 1,000 pupils  ultimately.<\/p><p>The existing post-primary school in the area referred to is very highly regarded locally. It is the intention of the patron that the new post-primary school would replicate and achieve the high standards and success attained in the existing school.

The ceilings and savings measures contained in the CER were informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) carried out in 2011.  The ceilings published in the CER form the basis upon which the detailed 2014 expenditure allocations were decided by the Government.  The <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report <\/i>also provided for a new &ldquo;whole-of-year&rdquo; budgetary process, whereby the 2014 ministerial expenditure allocations would be open for scrutiny and discussion before the relevant Oireachtas Committees.  <\/p><p>  The composition of the budget allocations for 2014 in respect of each Vote were set out in the Expenditure Report 2014 published on 15 October.  The Government took account of a wide range of often competing considerations and policy priorities to decide on the distribution of the resources available in order to strike a balance between bringing sustainability to the public finances while protecting to the greatest extent possible, both the economic recovery and the most vulnerable in society.<\/p><p>  To put this into context, gross voted spending has been reduced from its peak of &euro;63.1 billion in 2009 to &euro;54.6 billion in 2013.  This represents a reduction of approximately 13.5% between 2009 and 2013.  Estimated voted expenditure for 2014 will be in the region of &euro;52.9 billion with a targeted general Government deficit of 4.8%, a significant reduction from the underlying deficit of 11.2%t at the end of 2011.  The management of the respective expenditure allocations for 2014 will continue to be a matter for each Minister in accordance with overall agreed Government policy.<\/p><p>  In relation to the troika, the Irish Government's commitment to the EU\/IMF programme of financial support was clearly illustrated by our sustained strong record in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and measures while meeting all quantitative targets.  The EU\/IMF programme was subject to policy conditionality which was set out in programme documents - the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MOU), the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.  The conditionality in these documents was subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the troika) to ensure the broad programme objectives were met.  Such assessments were undertaken at the quarterly reviews.  Each update to the programme documents included the protraction or revisions to existing commitments along with new commitments.  <\/p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the hard policy decisions this Government has made over the last number of years has enabled us to bring our finances back to a sustainable level and just as importantly, the Government decided on 14 November that Ireland is now in the best position to exit the EU\/IMF programme of financial assistance on December 15 without the need to pre-arrange a new precautionary credit line from our EU and IMF partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100071#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Implementation","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100071#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[50053\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100071#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which all unions and management throughout the public service have met their targets on an annual basis over the past three years in respect of savings required in line with the troika agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Indeed, data released in the Exchequer Statement of 2 October indicated that the Exchequer primary deficit target outlined in the EU\/IMF programme was met for the twelfth consecutive quarter. <\/p><p>  In order to achieve the general government deficit target of below 3% of GDP by 2015, all components of the public finances must make an appropriate contribution. In this context, reducing the Exchequer Pay Bill has been an important element in reducing public expenditure.  Public Servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State, through a number of measures which have helped to reduce the Public Service pay bill from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009, to an estimated &euro;14.1 billion in 2013. <\/p><p>  Public Service management has worked with staff representatives to secure significant cost reductions and to deliver necessary reforms and work place changes, through the Public Service Croke Park agreement and most recently through the Haddington Road agreement. The benefits of the Croke Park agreement have been significant as evidenced by the final report of the Implementation Body. That report concluded that the agreement facilitated significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime, comprising of almost &euro;1 billion in pay savings and over &euro;800m in non-pay efficiency savings. The Body also concluded that the vast majority of commitments around cost extraction, reforms and changed work practices had been substantially delivered. <\/p><p>  More recently, the Haddington Road agreement, which came into force on 1 July, sets out a number of measures aimed at reducing the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by 2016. In addition to these cost saving measures, the Agreement also provides for an additional 15 million working hours across all sectors of the Public Service. The additional hours will ensure that public service management is able to maintain service delivery while also enabling the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious reform agenda.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of Public Service managers across every sector of the Public Service to make full use of these additional hours and the other hard-won workplace flexibilities agreed in Haddington Road. In order to harness the full potential of these additional hours, it will be essential that public service management continue to evaluate innovative ways of utilising these hours over the next three years.<\/p><p>  Where public service unions and the Government sign up to collective agreements, in this case the Haddington Road agreement, I am satisfied that both unions and management are committed to the delivery of the terms of those agreements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100071#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":213,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":214,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":216,"content":"<p>Questions No. 90 and 91 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100072#WRK00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100072#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[49847\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100072#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the impact that his departmental budget for 2014 will have on the budgets of the Industrial Development Agency, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, Intertrade Ireland, county enterprise boards and local enterprise offices.

Where a recipient of one parent family payment is in receipt of maintenance payments, half of the value of these payments is assessed as means and the rate of payment is adjusted accordingly. In addition, where a recipient has rent or mortgage payments up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week, these costs can be fully offset against any maintenance paid and no reduction occurs in the rate of one-parent family payment where the maintenance received does not exceed housing costs (subject to a maximum of  such costs of &euro;95.23 per week).<\/p><p>  Accordingly, the impact of the current welfare arrangements means that, in many cases, any reduction or increase in the level of maintenance paid can have no effect or relatively minimal effect on the rate of one parent family payment payable.<\/p><p>  It is not possible, at this stage, to quantify the number of one parent family payment recipients currently benefiting from maintenance payments whose welfare payment rates may be indirectly affected by any potential behavioural changes consequent on the proposed tax measure and, accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the estimate for that payment in 2014.

Its purpose is to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently, as an aid in the protection and conservation of the built heritage.  As Minister, I recommend structures rated as being of 'regional importance' or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authorities, in this case Kildare County Council.<\/p><p>  I am advised that there are 12 buildings in the Curragh Camp recorded in the NIAH survey of 2003, which were recommended to be included in the Record of Protected Structures of Kildare County Council. I understand that subsequently 7 of these structures were added to the Record of Protected Structures.   My Department has no record of having received reasons for non-inclusion of the remaining structures and will formally enquire of Kildare County Council as to the reasons the remaining 5 structures were not included in the Record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100076#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Cultural Institutions","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100077#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[49885\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100077#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the National Library of Ireland will make the James O'Dea Railway Photographic Collection available on line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>The mission of the National Library of Ireland (NLI) is to make accessible to everyone the documentary and intellectual record of the life of Ireland.

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be met from renewable sources by 2020. All of the renewable energy support schemes provide subsidies to eligible projects as opposed to grant aid.The AER was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run to the mid 2000s. AER was subsequently replaced by the feed-in tariff scheme known as REFIT. The AER schemes were all introduced prior to full electricity market liberalisation.   REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects. Both AER and REFIT are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy. <\/p><p>  The estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).

The period for public submissions under this review closed on 27 September 2013.  Consideration of these submissions is currently underway with a view to evaluating their content in the context of the review.<\/p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I asked the Housing &amp;amp; Sustainable Communities Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  I have received an interim draft of the review from the Agency and I intend to issue an updated circular letter to local authorities shortly arising from some the Agency&rsquo;s findings.  However, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order fully to assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures.  This additional work is underway and I expect to make further determinations in the coming months.<\/p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme, in respect of distressed mortgages in the commercial sector, on a pilot basis in February 2012.  This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.  A pilot mortgage to rent scheme for the most acute cases of local authority mortgage arrears which was launched earlier in 2013 , in Westmeath Count y and Dublin City Councils, has now been completed.  It is intended to implement this scheme throughout the local authority sector in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100080#WRS00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100080#WRS00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100080#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[49868\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100080#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason one blonde haired child was taken away from one family while the dark haired child was left if the children were at risk.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>Ms Emily Logan has agreed to conduct an independent inquiry into the cases referred to by the Deputy and I will be appointing her in accordance with Section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended by section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2007) to ensure that she has the appropriate powers to conduct a comprehensive Inquiry.

To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.

Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 44 applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.<\/p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The Courts Service Board has 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice.

The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four vacancies occurred and four appointments were made to the board.<\/p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time. One case remains at present.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.<\/p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Eight vacancies occurred.  Eight* appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Three of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself.<\/p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Fifteen vacancies occurred.

Four appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.<\/p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  One vacancy occurred.  One appointment was made to the board of the National Disability Authority (NDA).  I made the appointment after seeking expressions of interest of which I received 12 applications.  This appointment was from a public applicant.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the current board of the NDA is due to expire on 21 December 2013.  The vacancies are for 12 ordinary members and a chairperson.  On 23 October an invitation for expressions of interest was placed on my Department's website with a closing date for receipt of applications of 15 November.<\/p><p><b><i>Parole Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Ten vacancies occurred.  There were ten appointments made to the Parole Board.<\/p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Four vacancies occurred.  The Government appointed four people on 3 April, 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<\/p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Eleven vacancies occurred.  Eleven appointments were made out of which seven positions were advertised as the remaining four positions, in accordance with the relevant legislation, are to be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 29 applications were received.  Six of the seven appointments made following public advertising were drawn for the applications received.<\/p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Three vacancies occurred.

Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<\/p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  I received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<\/p><p><b><i>The Equality Authority<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The fourteen outgoing board members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012, and therefore the issues of selection did not arise.  The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form a new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Authority Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The  Working Group that I established to advise me on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new Commission in its Report of April 2012 recommended that an independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing the new members.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.<\/p><p>  In November 2012 advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media.  The independent panel forwarded its recommendations of 14 names in March 2013.  While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government has appointed the 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year or 5 year basis to ensure that the term of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.  On 31 May 2013, I appointed 12 of their number to the board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two bodies are dissolved.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that since my previous reply to Parliamentary Question 382, which he put down for answer on 18 June 2013, both the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board have transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>My Department works closely with the relevant Government Departments and State Agencies in relation to bioenergy issues, particularly the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Teagasc.  New opportunities and market outlets are emerging for farmers and the rural economy in producing bioenergy as a form of renewable energy.  The bioenergy sector offers the opportunity to offset Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels, and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time providing new market opportunities for the agriculture sector.<\/p><p>  Challenging targets exist under the Renewable Energy Directive whereby Ireland is required to achieve 16% of its total final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  The 16% target is broken down into renewable energy contributions of 40% of electricity, 12% of heat and 10% of transport.<\/p><p>  Since 2007 my Department has administered the Bioenergy Scheme offering grant-aid to support the establishment of the energy crops miscanthus and willow.  To the end of 2013 over 3,300 hectares of these crops have been established.<\/p><p>  Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is another area that has been supported by my Department.  A Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On-Farm Waste Processing Facilities was introduced by my Department in June 2006 under the aegis of the 2000-2006 National Development Plan, with funding of &euro;4m as provided for in that Plan.  In 2007, grant-aid was approved under the Scheme for the development of ten on-farm anaerobic digestion facilities.  The grant-aid is payable only on completion of the work concerned and one grant of &euro;400,000 has been drawn down to-date.  Applicants, on request, are being provided with extensions until end-June 2014 to complete the investment works needed in order to draw down the grant-aid available.<\/p><p>  My Department also provided funding for research under the Stimulus fund 2007&ndash;2013 to three projects related to anaerobic digestion which are ongoing.  The price supports via Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff for AD announced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, indexed and offered on a 15-year basis, have the potential to underpin the development of the technology in Ireland.  The introduction of these tariffs was supported by my Department.<\/p><p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to encourage the use in practice of the &ldquo;product not waste&rdquo; scenario in relation to Animal By-Products.  Details available to my Department show that some 35,000 tonnes of tallow was used as a fuel in Ireland in 2011.<\/p><p>  The state supported afforestation programme has resulted in a forest estate which is now providing an increasing level of renewable biomass from thinnings and from sawmilling residues. It is estimated that in 2012 over one million cubic metres of wood, more than one third of the annual harvest, was used for energy generation. National projections indicate that as harvest increases over the coming decades so will the contribution of the forest sector to renewable biomass.  These activities contribute significantly to mitigating emissions from fossil fuels as well as contributing to rural development and jobs.<\/p><p>  Officials from my Department are contributing to the development of a Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources National Bioenergy Strategy to be published shortly.  This will take account of the various strands of bioenergy that are dealt with within my Department, with a view to maximising their potential contribution to achieving renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[49970\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cavan will receive their disadvantaged area scheme payment and single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>As processing of the application of the person named under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme\/Single Payment Scheme has recently been finalised, payments under both schemes are due to issue in to the person named in the coming days, directly to the nominated bank account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01250"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[49974\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100084#WRW01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Galway who is currently receiving a single farm payment would continue to receive that payment if they planted some of their land with forestry and received a forestry premium for that portion of land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children. <\/p><p>  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. <\/p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all board of management appointments. <\/p><p>  Since I took office in March 2011, I have directly appointed 46 persons to the boards of management under the aegis of my Department and there have been 52 vacancies since that date.   I can confirm that there is currently one vacancy on the board of management of the AAI, four vacancies for the FSA, one vacancy for the NEWB and no vacancies for the Children Detention Schools. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  <\/p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. <\/p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of  7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the board. <\/p><p>  The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency.  The current membership of the board of the Family Support Agency will be appointed to the board of the new Child and Family Agency when it is established.<\/p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   <\/p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  <\/p><p><b>Appointments to State Boards under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs since March, 2011 <\/b><\/p><p><b>National Educational Welfare Board<\/b><table><tr><th>Board Member<\/th><th>Term <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Nuala Doherty (Chair)<\/td><td>30\/07\/12 &ndash;

Nicotine containing products such as e-cigarettes are being considered in the context of this proposed tobacco products directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100088#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100088#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[50004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112100088#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason Crohn's disease is not on the long term illness list; if he will consider adding same in view of the costs of the associated medication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
