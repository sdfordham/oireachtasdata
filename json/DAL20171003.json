It was an appalling atrocity with so many innocent people mowed down.  At times like this, we are reminded of the extraordinary role of first responders in situations like this and we salute them and their courage in assisting.  One hopes that common sense will ultimately prevail and that gun laws in the US are changed.  It is extraordinary how so many deadly weapons can end up in the hands of one individual.<\/p>  <p>  The hospice movement is one of the most cherished areas of care in our country.  Uniquely among our health services, it enjoys almost universal approval.  The ethos of care, empathy, dignity and space for families to be with their loved ones is quite remarkable to experience.  Over the past number of decades, the advances in palliative care have been quite remarkable encompassing short-term respite, community-based care and end-of-life stage care.  We all know that communities throughout the country have helped to sustain them and have fundraised for and supported them.  Yet the Government is treating these organisations and others throughout the country in a hard-hearted and deeply cynical manner by, in the first instance, refusing to allocate sufficient funding to them but, worse, compounding that by refusing to allocate funding to cover pay restoration for staff working in these institutions as per the public service pay agreements.<\/p><p>During the FEMPI negotiations and the cuts to public service pay, these institutions were told that they had to cut their workers' pay in line with HSE employees.  However, they have been given no funding whatsoever to cover pay restoration.  These include highly respected centres such as Marymount hospice in Cork, Milford Care Centre in Limerick, St. Joseph's Hospital in Raheny and Galway hospice, which I visited recently.<\/p> <p> It is not only hospices.  There are hundreds of other organisations across the country in a similar situation which provide disability services, addiction counselling, services for carers, organisations such as Barnardo's and Barretstown camp for young children with cancer, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Diabetes Federation of Ireland and as many as 768 others.  The Minister's reply to parliamentary questions on this subject is deeply cynical and dishonest.  He says that they were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions, or the provisions of subsequent public service agreements which provided for pay restoration.  Many of these organisations depend on the community.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach added insult to injury some months ago by telling me that they would not get pay restoration but that he would not allow them to cut services either.  It is not tenable.  I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will provide necessary funding to enable hospices, disability organisations, elderly care organisations and many more to pay their employees the same rate of restoration that is allowed for in the public service pay agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507035900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Before I answer, I join with Deputy Martin in offering my condolences and those of the Government to the victims and families of those killed and wounded in the recent attack in Las Vegas.  In the face of such horror and tragedy, the Irish Government and people stand in solidarity with our friends and families in the United States.

It was not just an attack on the people of the United States but also on citizens from all over the world.  I sent a message to President Trump yesterday to express the condolences of the Irish people to the people of America.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Martin's question, everyone in Government, myself included, is aware of the wonderful work that the hospice movement does, not just in hospices themselves but also in hospice home care.  We have been very supportive of the hospice movement and the budget for hospices and palliative care has increased every year for the last number of years.  For my own part, I was very involved in ensuring that funding was secured for St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown so that it could open fully and serve my constituents and others from the north Dublin and Meath region.  Deputy Martin knows that his former colleague, former Deputy Brian Lenihan, was essential in ensuring that we got State land on which to build that hospice.  I was, in many ways, carrying on his work.  He ensured that the land was secured, the community raised the money and, as Minister, I provided funding to open it fully.  Castlebar hospice is now under construction.  While it is not under construction yet, I know plans for the new hospice in Wicklow are now very advanced, and there are also plans for hospice units in Waterford and Drogheda.  There is a definite need for one in the midlands too.<\/p>  <p>  That shows real commitment and progress towards providing the option of people ending their days in a hospice where they can die in a dignified way, which is what I think people would want for their friends and loved ones rather than for them to die in a busy hospital ward.  Hospice home care is also important, because very few people die at home now and I think many people would wish to die at home if hospice home care was available.  That needs to be increased in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The issue the Deputy referred to relates to the law around section 38 and section 39 bodies.  Section 38 bodies are considered to be part of the public service and therefore people who work in it are public servants, are affected by FEMPI legislation when it goes up or down, and have public sector pensions.<\/p><p>Those who work under section 39 provisions, often hospices, charities and other bodies, are not public servants.  They are not bound by the rules that apply to public servants and, therefore, they are not directly bound by FEMPI legislation.  When salaries are being cut or when salaries are being increased, they are not bound by the rules around public sector pensions.  The way those bodies are funded is through a block grant from Government and those bodies have a lot of autonomy to decide how that money is allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507036200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>That, in essence, is the dishonesty of the Government's response.  Correspondence to me states that as a section 39 body, they were instructed by the HSE to stay in line with the HSE pay scales and apply the cuts as per the Haddington Road agreement.  All hospices were so instructed.  All of them have communicated to the Minister in this vein, and the other organisations as well.  It is not true to say that they were not governed by FEMPI legislation and that they did not have to implement pay cuts under FEMPI agreements.  They did.  In Marymount hospice, for example, there was a &euro;300,000 deficit in 2017, and it will be higher in 2018.  This is on top of a fairly low base, as it stands.  In that hospice, for example, the stark statement is made that in its current model, Marymount is not a sustainable entity.  I visited a Galway hospital recently and it is the same story there.<\/p>  <p>  Words are cheap, but I would have to put it to the Taoiseach that the existing current base is inadequate.  The Government's actions, in cynically trotting out this mantra that such organisation are not subject to FEMPI legislation and their employees are not public servants, is dishonest.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that nurses in a hospice should get less pay than nurses in other parts of the health services or care staff in a hospice should get less pay than those in any other service?  The Government is cynically exploiting the volunteers who are keeping these organisations going, from hospice to disability rights, across the board.<\/p>  <p>  I have been told that hospice beds will be cut next year if this issue is not addressed.  It is time to stop hiding behind that mantra, which it is fundamentally dishonest.  I would ask that the Minister would meet the organisations face to face and get this issue resolved because the current position is not sustainable for them and is doing a great disservice to their ethos and to the fact that they are so rooted and so generally applauded in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1507036200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am not sure from where that instruction that the Deputy referred to came.

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh leo go l&eacute;ir.<\/p>  <p>  On Sunday, millions of Catalans voted in a referendum on independence.  They did so in the face of violent repression on the part of the Spanish state.  A Sinn F&eacute;in delegation of Senators, Deputies and MEPs were in Catalonia as international observers along with others.  They witnessed the coercion at first hand.  Old people were assaulted as they tried to enter polling stations.  The Spanish police fired plastic bullets into crowds of innocent people simply because they wanted to exercise their right to vote.<\/p><p>We should know only too well the horrific consequences of the use of plastic bullets by the British Army in recent years in our country.  I want to commend the enormous courage of the Catalan people on their efforts to hold a peaceful referendum.  That was a huge achievement in and of itself, organisationally and logistically.  Families occupied polling stations and kept them open so that their fellow citizens could vote.  Catalan fire fighters formed human shields to protect voters and farmers brought in their tractors to form barricades so that citizens could vote.  These were not violent actions and they should not have been met with the violent response they received from the Spanish state.  As the Taoiseach knows well, the Speaker of the Catalan Parliament has been prosecuted for holding a debate and a vote in the Parliament on the issue of an independence referendum.  The former president and two former ministers have also been prosecuted for organising a non-binding referendum on independence in 2014.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael has a close connection with the government party in Spain and it is time for the Taoiseach to encourage dialogue.  The international community, especially the European Union, has an obligation to ensure that Catalonia can pursue its course of self determination without fear of suppression.  Our Government should be to the forefront in defending their right to decide their own future.  What they decide is a secondary issue and is entirely a matter for themselves.  The refusal to make this case is justified on the basis that these issues are an internal matter for the Spanish state but that is exactly the pretext that was used by the British state for decades to prevent the scrutiny of British rule in the North.  It was only when these issues became internationalised that remedies emerged.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach stand up for the principles of democracy and the right to self determination for the people of Catalonia and will he use his influence and connections with the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Mariano Rajoy, to get him to accept mediation as part of the necessary process of talks between his Government and the Catalan people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300005#C01000","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507036800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s, f&aacute;ilte ar ais a Ghear&oacute;id-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1507036800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

Like Deputy Adams, everyone in this House and everyone in Ireland who watched the news on Sunday was horrified at the scenes we saw broadcast from Barcelona and Girona and to see that level of violence happening in what is a European country that has been a democracy since the 1970s.  As I said on Monday, violence is never the solution to political disagreements.  Violence by state actors, whether it is the police or the army, against unarmed civilians is disproportionate and should not have happened.  It is also counterproductive.  We know from our own history in this country and from history around the world that when policemen and soldiers use violence against unarmed civilians, it is counterproductive.  It causes people to become more radicalised, causes greater nationalism and greater disunity.  I hope the Spanish Government will reflect on the historical experiences of many countries in the world when it considers its next course of action into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy that dialogue is the right way forward and that is what I would like to see occur in Spain.

The Taoiseach may know that Terence McSwiney's hunger strike in 1920 inspired the independence movement there.  When Terence McSwiney died, organisations from Catalonia wrote to the British Prime Minister condemning the treatment of the Cork mayor and there were mass demonstrations on the streets of Barcelona.<\/p>  <p>  We are agreed that we need dialogue and mediation.

On both occasions the referendums happened in accordance with the law of the state.  The referendum held in Scotland occurred under the laws of the United Kingdom, while the referendum held in Quebec occurred under the laws of Canada.  The referendum in this instance was different in that it did not happen under Spanish law or within the constitutional legal framework of Spain.  As a member state of the European Union, we respect the law, the constitution and the territorial integrity of Spain as another member state.  If there is to be a referendum held in the future, as was the case in Scotland and Quebec, it should happen within the legal and constitutional framework of the country.

In recent weeks there has been some evidence to give weight to such fears.  First, there was the creation of the new strategic communications unit, with an assistant secretary level head and a staff of five members.  Incidentally, since the creation of the new unit no press releases have been posted on the Taoiseach's departmental website.  We then began to hear about a principal officer-level vacancy being created to head up the communications functions in individual Departments, although it is unclear, so far, how many such individual posts have been created.  Together, these changes represent a very significant taxpayer investment in Government communications.  The Taoiseach formally told the House that the investment in communications would be cost neutral, but that is only true if the vacancies in question are filled at the expense of other areas of the Civil Service and the public service.  It is time that the Taoiseach provided clarity on the number of positions he is creating and the total cost involved.  <\/p>  <p>  The creation of these new public sector jobs was a story and in recent weeks we have see two more stories which cause some concern.  The first was the publication of a tender by the Taoiseach's Department, valued at &euro;130,000, plus VAT, each year, for commissioning tracking polls.  All political parties invest in tracking polls or polls of some sort to test the public mood on issues, but with this tender it seems that Fine Gael wants to shift the burden away from the party onto the taxpayer.  When we were in government, we commissioned research after individual referendum results, but we published the results.  I have two questions.  First, will the Taoiseach commit to publishing the results of any tracking poll paid for from the public purse?  Second, will he set out, in full, the cost of the communications unit and the staff members he is putting in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300007#E00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1507037400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I have heard the allegation on a number of occasions that the Government is putting style ahead of substance.

There is a big deficit in communications between the Government and the general public.  The public have a right to know what the Government does, how their taxes are being spent and about the programmes under way.  We intend to improve that process.  A huge amount of money is spent by the Government and agencies on communications.  Approximately 750 staff work across Departments and different agencies in communications and public relations in some way, for which, believe it or not, the total budget is &euro;170 million, much of which is valid.  It involves Tourism Ireland marketing Ireland abroad and Bord Bia marketing the food industry.  It involves advertisements advising people to attend for their BreastCheck examination or receive the influenza vaccine.  It is all very good spending, but a certain proportion of it involves different Departments and agencies advertising their own logos and so on.  That is exactly the kind of thing I want to change.  It has been done in Britain and the Netherlands where the overall cost of government communications across Departments and agencies has been reduced, but in a much better way.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge confusion.

The new bypass is, or was, to begin on the western side of Farranfore, bypass Killarney and join the N22 to Cork and the N72 to Mallow at Lissivigeen.  Another segment of the scheme is to link Muckross Road to Moll's Gap with the N22 and the N72 also at Lisivigeen.  Specific plans are ready and the route has been determined and identified by the very capable staff of the National Roads Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, as it is now known, and in the national roads design office in Castleisland.  The new bypass is critically important to the town of Killarney and the county of Kerry.  From early May to late September every year traffic jams are a regular occurrence, especially in the morning and the evening, with people being left to sit in cars on Muckross Road, Hans Liebherr Road, Mission Road, the Tralee road to Cleeny Roundabout and the N22 from Roadstone Wood Limited's quarry at Minish all the way into town.  If the bypass was in place, it would help to eliminate most of the accidents and the slaughter that occurs at the dangerous junctions around Killarney, namely, that at the top of Lewis Road, Madam's Hill junction, the Woodlawn Road-Clasheen junction and at Coolcaslagh, as well as the very dangerous junction in Farranfore village heading for Firies and Currow.  Killarney is, without question, the tourism capital of the world.  Built by many great local families and businesspeople, it operates the very best of hotels, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops.  It has jarveys, bus operators, bicycle shops and the wonderful INEC events centre, ably assisted by the Tidy Towns committees and the chamber of commerce.  The existing bypass linking Muckross Road with the Tralee road at Cleeny Roundabout is now recognised by engineers and management of Kerry County Council to be operating at maximum capacity, carrying more than 18,600 vehicles daily.  Figures recorded also indicate that 12,000 vehicles pass through Farranfore daily.  A total of 12,000 vehicles also use Muckross Road.  The scheme which has been suspended for many years needs to be reactivated urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300009#G00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1507038000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for referring to a very important roads project.

The committee worked tirelessly and held a number of sittings and meetings to discuss the Bill.  It met with over a dozen groups, including the Law Society, trade unions and business groups.  The committee produced a report that made 21 recommendations to strengthen the Bill.  As someone who attended two of the meetings and addressed the committee on both occasions to discuss the recommendations for the different groups, I support and accept all the amendments that have been made in the report.<\/p><p>We are seeking to move this Bill forward.  I understand that since we published our Bill, and notwithstanding the Government rubbishing our Bill and saying there was no need for such a Bill, it is now talking about a Bill of its own.  We do not believe that is necessary.  We believe the right thing to do is to support our Bill with the amendments that have been made and actually deal with the real issue.  What the Government is talking about is banning zero-hour contracts, which is not the real issue.  The real issue is &quot;if and when&quot; contracts and low-hour contracts.  That is where the exploitation and problem reside and that is the issue that needs to be resolved.  The Labour Court recently suspended a case between Dunnes Stores and the Mandate trade union for six months pending the passing of my Bill into law so there is a clear need for this legislation to be moved on.  It is an issue that is important to many working people.  Of course, we would support ending zero-hour contracts but the University of Limerick study, which was commissioned by the previous Government and which examined this issue in detail, was very clear that the biggest issue facing workers was &quot;if and when&quot; contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P01800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1507041900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Twelfth Report of Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1507041900,"counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02000"},{"type":"speech","time":1507041900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:(<i>a<\/i>) approves the Twelfth Report of the Standing Committee of Selection in accordance with Standing Order 27F, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28th September, 2017, and discharges and appoints members to<br \/><br \/>Committees accordingly; and<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) pursuant to Standing Order 93(2), appoints Deputy Joe Carey as Chair of the Committee on Rural and Community Development.&quot;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02100","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1507041900,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1507041900,"counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1507041900,"counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02350"},{"type":"question","time":1507041900,"counter":185,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[40344\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet Committee C, European Union, including Brexit, last met.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507041900,"counter":186,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[40545\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet Committee C, European Union, including Brexit, will be meeting.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507041900,"counter":187,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[40542\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet Committee C, European Union, including Brexit, last met.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507041900,"counter":188,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[41385\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on Cabinet Committee C, European Union, including Brexit; and when it last met.","asker":"1360","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507041900,"counter":189,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[41491\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300017#P02800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet Committee C, European Union, including Brexit, last met; and when it is scheduled to meet again.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1507041900,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined to the House in July, the Government agreed a new streamlined Cabinet committee structure and approved the establishment of six new committees, one of which is Cabinet Committee C.

I want to ask him a very simple but important question which I asked last week.  Has he proposed to the British Government or European Union partners that Northern Ireland receive special economic status following Brexit?  He has said he will not propose any border arrangement and seems to have delayed work by the Revenue Commissioners on the matter.  What exactly does he propose?  One media statement by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that the Border be moved to the Irish Sea was rejected by the North and does not appear to have been formally followed up.  Once again, given that the Tory Government states it wants the United Kingdom to leave both the Single Market and the customs union, has the Taoiseach made specific proposals on the status of Northern Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  Given that there was a summit last week, it is surprising that the Taoiseach did not make himself available in this House for statements either before or after the summit.  While he did not make himself available here to talk about the summit, he managed to bring a party person with him to take videos of him on the Government jet and at a meeting at the Irish Embassy in Tallinn.  These videos were first published on the Fine Gael website; clearly, therefore, they have no official status.  Does the Taoiseach think this type of party politicisation of a Government event is acceptable?  While his personal obsession with media management is clear, why did he decide to break from the practice of his predecessors and use formal European Union business for purely party political purposes?  There is an important distinction to be made in the Taoiseach attending summit meetings on behalf of the people as head of Government, not as the leader of a mere political party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300018#Q00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Given that we do not have a designated Minister for Brexit, it is important that the Cabinet committee on the European Union meet regularly.  On the EU summit in Tallinn, I note that it was agreed that the European Union would be a global leader in the digital economy and that the leaders were committed to finalising the digital Single Market within a year.  Will the Taoiseach provide a progress report on the matter?  It is an important aspect of the European Union's agenda and we need to know how Ireland is shaping up in the completion of the digital Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  On the future of Europe, there have been three significant speeches recently, one by the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker; one by French President Emmanuel Macron and one by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who supported the views of the French President.  A vision for Europe is being set out.  I would welcome the Taoiseach's views on how it is proceeding and how we will provide an input.  Many are saying many things and the future of Europe is up for grabs.  Ireland needs to be clear on where it stands in all of these debates.  I know that momentum is building on the issue of corporate tax harmonisation, which is of concern to Ireland.

We look forward to hearing the outcome of the Taoiseach's special Cabinet meeting on the issue.  He will know that today the European Parliament passed a significant resolution on the current state of the Brexit negotiations.  It specifically states there has not been sufficient progress in the negotiations on citizens' rights, Ireland and the settlement of the British Government's financial obligations.  It calls on the European Council, unless there is a breakthrough, not to move into discussions on new trade arrangements with Britain.  It is clear from the resolution which was supported by Sinn F&eacute;in's four MEPs that the European Parliament believes Britain has refused to detail how it plans to resolve its financial settlement or divorce bill and how it plans to deal with the Border or the rights of European citizens.  I was concerned about the positivity of some of the Taoisearch's remarks after his recent meeting with Prime Minister May.  It was not anything he said but the effort to put a positive spin on what she had said when it was clear that what she had set out what was not sufficient and that, in particular, she was in breach of her obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  Does the Taoiseach accept the assertion which is reaffirmed in the European Parliament resolution that Britain must provide a solution that will ensure full compliance with the Good Friday Agreement?  Does he also accept - he has not yet said this - that the North has to remain within the internal market and the customs union?  We have been arguing for designated status for the North within the European Union which is essentially what the people voted for; they voted against Brexit.  It seems that the Government's position is to support special arrangements for the North outside the European Union, something which just would not work.

It is extraordinary that an announcement of this kind was made, for example, when a number of years ago the Embassy in Tehran was closed, along with that in the Vatican and others.<\/p>  <p>  It seems from the Taoiseach's reply that his announcement was not based on any policy agreed by Cabinet.

What the Taoiseach seems to be indicating now is the work has now begun well after the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  I called last year for a detailed staffing audit and future plan.  Has that audit been undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, by the Taoiseach's own Department because I asked separately for a complete review of the Department of the Taoiseach and its needs in relation to Brexit?  The Taoiseach will be aware that Deputy Donnelly, who has done a lot of good work on this, discovered through a series of probing parliamentary questions that most of the agencies had not even filled the additional staff allocations they had received in respect of Brexit and the staff had not been hired.  It is that disconnect between the reality of what is happening in the here and now and the grandiose announcements that we will be doubling our global footprint some time in the distant future.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get with delivery and executing what we have agreed in the immediate and short terms.  That would give the people some confidence that propagandistic announcements that are made from time to time will be realised.  People are becoming cynical and sceptical about statements that in five years' time this will happen and in six years' time that will happen.

No one could argue with the intentions of the plan - attracting greater investment, boosting tourism and trade, building stronger links with the diaspora and increasing cultural exchanges.  These are aims that Sinn F&eacute;in certainly supports.  The notion of increased diplomatic and international agency services will increase the likelihood of delivery, but there is no timeframe that I am conscious of.  Could the Taoiseach tell us what timeframe there may be?  How will the increases in staff be divided between the diplomatic service and agencies, such as IDA Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland?

The Taoiseach will have noted the French President's call recently for the need for increased and accelerated EU integration, tax harmonisation and further EU military co-operation.  President Macron spoke about a two-tier Europe, a sovereign Europe with its own separate parliament for members of the eurozone who will have their own finance minister, and he wants a single EU corporate tax band.  This is the federalist dream, but it also is flying directly in the face of the so-called guarantees that were secured by the Irish Government in the aftermath of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty in 2009.

When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I had the opportunity to travel to all parts of the world promoting aviation and tourism in particular, as well as doing other work including general Government representation and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland work, as part of that travel.  I was always extraordinarily impressed by the quality of the staff we had on the ground, our diplomats and the people working for our agencies.  It occurred to me that we needed a lot more of them and that it would be a good investment by our country to expand our diplomatic presence and the footprint of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and our cultural agencies.  Now that I hold the office of Taoiseach, I intend to do something about it and make it a reality.  I did not set this out as an August story.  It was first proposed back in May or June in a document which I published entitled, \"Taking Ireland Forward\".

We could just open the exact same number of embassies again or, in some places, we might decide to build up the embassy.  We have a lot of embassies that only have one or two members of staff where we might go to four, for example.  In a lot of countries the staff are only able to cover the capital and very rarely get to other parts of the country and that is something I would like to see changed.  We have already allocated funding for extra staff for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia.  The Deputy is correct in saying that there have been delays in recruiting same but they are being recruited.  Indeed, just as I arrived in Canada, an additional Enterprise Ireland staff member had just been recruited.<\/p>  <p>  The speech made by President Macron was, of course, discussed in Tallinn.  The major topic of discussion on the Thursday night in Tallinn was the future of Europe and during that debate we discussed President Macron's vision for the future of Europe, Jean Claude Junker's state of the Union speech and the speech made by Prime Minister Theresa May in Florence.  I am not in a position to go through in detail all of the suggestions that President Macron made but it is fair to say that I would agree with some and disagree with others.  We will have time to go into that in more detail in the future.  <\/p>  <p>  This plan does not cover our international development aid commitments.  It is not about that but we will need a separate plan in that area.  I am familiar with Deputy  Burton's excellent work as a former Minister of State with responsibility for that area in the 1990s.  We are now very far behind in honouring the commitment to reach 0.7% of GNP or GNI*, as the case may be.  I think we are at about 0.33% at the moment so we would need to double our budget, which would be an increase in overseas development aid spending of something like &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million per year, which is a lot of money.  That is not the kind of thing we could do in a couple of years but I would certainly like us to set out a schedule as to how we might to do that in a realistic timeframe and then hold ourselves to account on an annual or biannual basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Visits","time":1507043700,"counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00500"},{"type":"question","time":1507043700,"counter":238,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[40346\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Justin Trudeau.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507043700,"counter":239,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[40414\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507043700,"counter":240,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[41492\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his engagement with the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Justin Trudeau on 20 August 2017.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507043700,"counter":241,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[41632\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Canada and his meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1507043700,"counter":242,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[41675\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300020#S01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Canada.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1507043700,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.

My visit commenced in Montr&eacute;al with an official welcoming ceremony and a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, during which we discussed the provisional implementation of CETA, which came into effect on 21 September.  Both of us recognise and welcome the benefits that this agreement will have for the Canadian and Irish economies, in terms of job creation and revenue for our taxpayers.  We discussed the latest developments on Brexit and Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the negotiations.  Prime Minister Trudeau updated me on the latest state of play with regards to the NAFTA renegotiations with the United States and Mexico.  In the context of a wider conversation on health care, I updated the Prime Minister on plans to hold a constitutional referendum on the Eighth Amendment.  We also discussed climate change and reaffirmed both our countries&rsquo; commitment to the Paris Agreement.<\/p><p>  Following our meeting, Prime Minister Trudeau and I walked together in the Fiert&eacute; parade, where I also had the opportunity to meet informally with the Mayor of Montr&eacute;al and the Premier of Quebec.  I also met leaders and representatives of the Irish community in Montr&eacute;al and the wider Quebec region before travelling to Toronto.  In Toronto I had a number of business engagements including a business breakfast event hosted by Enterprise Ireland, the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce and the Ireland Funds which was attended by over 150 people.  I also hosted a Tourism Ireland round table event with representatives of the travel industry and airlines and had a number of individual meetings with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies.  During my visit, the IDA client company Toronto Dominion Bank announced an expansion of its European operations.  The bank has chosen Dublin as its post-Brexit EU hub and I am glad to report that it will also establish a bond trading unit here.<\/p><p>At an Irish community reception hosted by Ambassador Kelly I had the opportunity to meet with political and community leaders and members of the Irish diaspora, including representatives of the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre.

I also travelled to the US, Canada border where I was briefed on customs arrangements there.  While they employ a range of mechanisms to ensure smooth and efficient customs processing, it was patently clear to me that this was not a satisfactory model for border arrangements - if any - on this island after Brexit.

He does not give a damn what anybody thinks about it.  In a terrifying development, he recently talked about the possibility of the United States totally destroying North Korea.  This is the man in command of the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world.  I need not mention his racist travel ban and all the other vile stuff he promised he would do and is now doing.  Is the Taoiseach seriously going to invite this man to Ireland?  If so, how advanced are the plans?  Have there been active discussions with the White House or US officials about when this visit might take place?

Instead of a multiday visit, the focus this time was on existing trading companies and links rather than on opening new ones.  Why was that the case?  It is surprising, given the potential opportunities under the new trading agreement.  I support the CETA trade agreement.  There was a debate in this House, instigated by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Private Members' time.  It opens up opportunities for additional jobs and greater exports from small to medium-sized companies, as well as multinationals which employ thousands.  It also offers opportunities for farming, although some challenges as well, but across the board we are an exporting country and it never ceases to amaze me that there is such ongoing hostility in this Parliament to the idea of open free trade agreements.  There may be issues within those but the instinct of previous speakers, in Sinn F&eacute;in and others, is to knock every single free trade agreement that is touted.  These agreements are aligned to the economic best interests of the country because if we were to stay isolationist and inward looking we could not create jobs or prosperity.  We must export over 90% of what we make to sustain ourselves as a nation.  This visit would have been a very good opportunity to help many such companies avail of the potential of the CETA in a post-Brexit environment.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach visited the US-Canada border.

We spoke about this last year.  Last year we said that we would deal with it on a case by case basis.  When we speak about this issue, we are speaking about certain areas of the country.  The Minister says \"nationwide\", but I am sure that in many parts of the country there is not the same level of crisis.  Every year, we have a huge level of rainfall in the north west compared to, say, the south east or other regions of the country.  The reality is that this is about the timing of that rainfall for many farmers . We have had an awful lot of rain in recent weeks and, in fact, in the past two months practically.  It has led to a situation where farmers are not able to get their second-cut silage.  I know the Minister is saying the weather may improve, but when we are talking about taking second-cut silage in the last weeks of October, it is of poor quality.  That is the reality facing farmers.  We need to ensure that a scheme is put in place so that farmers will know with confidence that they will not be let down.  They cannot be required to go with a begging bowl, one by one, asking, \"What can you do for me, please, Sir?\"  That is not appropriate.  The farming community needs to have something proper put in place.  The farming organisations are recognising it.  I am sure some of them also will be lobbying the Minister on the issue.  We saw the situation in County Donegal with the deluge of rain and the damage it did to the agriculture sector.

Such aid is subject to common EU rules designed to avoid distortion of competition within the European Union.<\/p><p>It is already possible to provide aid for farmers subject to a cumulative maximum limit of &euro;15,000 per farmer over three years.  Such aid is called <i>de minimis <\/i>aid and is designed to permit member states to provide assistance to primary producers at a level which does not distort competition across the union.  Ireland already provides such aid to farmers under a number of headings in addition to the aid it provides under its rural development programme, which is subject to a separate legal basis to that of state aid.  Some of the things which receive <i>de minimis <\/i>state aid from us include protein crops, tillage compensation scheme, dairy compensation package etc.<\/p><p>In addition, the common market organisation regulation of the CAP provides for a number of market support mechanisms, for example, intervention when beef falls to threshold levels which are well below current market prices or for butter and skimmed milk powder between the months of March and September.  More flexible measures against market disturbance can be made available when the conditions warrant it.  These are not measures that will be deployed regularly and in practice their deployment is very exceptional and requires the support of member states.<\/p><p>Regarding CAP market disturbance funding, emergency measures were introduced by the Commission in accordance with articles 219 and 220 of Regulation No. 1308\/2013 in recent years in direct response to the market difficulties being experienced by farmers and producers during this time. <\/p><p>Such measures included exceptional adjustment aid to milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors, with &euro;350 million in emergency funding allocated to member states.  Ireland's allocation of &euro;11.1 million from this fund, topped up by national funding, was used to leverage a greater fund of &euro;150 million to provide low-cost loans to the livestock and tillage sectors.<br\/><br\/>Currently in Ireland, dairy prices are strong, year to date average pigmeat and sheepmeat prices are close to the European Union average and whereas beef prices dropped back significantly since they peaked in June, they appear to have stabilised and are currently running at 97% of EU 15 average prices.

I am very aware of the importance of these supports for farmers and, accordingly, the issuing of payments under these schemes is a matter of priority for my Department.  The main schemes are delivered under the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, and each year approximately &euro;1.5 billion issues under these schemes.  My Department has a strong record in the efficient delivery of these payments, as evidenced by the fact that we perform very favourably compared to other EU member states in terms of both the dates on which payments are delivered and our ability to maximise the drawdown of available EU funding.<\/p><p>With regard to individual schemes, the main direct payment scheme is the basic payment scheme, BPS.  Advance payments are due to commence again this year on 16 October, which is the first date permissible under the EU regulations.  In 2016, advance payments also commenced on 16 October, with &euro;714 million issuing to 109,000 farmers on that date.  To date under the 2016 BPS, over &euro;1.18 billion has been issued to over 124,000 farmers.  The areas of natural constraint scheme commenced payment on schedule again this year in the week beginning 18 September, and to date over &euro;168 million has issued to over 78,000 farmers.  This represents a significant increase over the payment figures at this stage last year.<\/p><p>The current position regarding green low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments for 2015 is there are a small number of GLAS 1 farmers representing 0.5% of all GLAS 1 participants where payment is outstanding.  With regard to 2016 advance payments to GLAS 1 and 2 participants, payments have issued in over 98% of cases.  To date this year, we have paid over &euro;147 million to GLAS participants.<\/p><p>The online payment claim system for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, opened in July 2016.  Payments for approved investments continue to issue on an ongoing basis with 2,300 payment claims received and 1,680 cases paid.  Payments totalling over &euro;23.65 million have issued to date and continue to issue at an average rate of over &euro;1 million per week.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>I urge all farmers who have completed TAMS-approved works to submit their payment claims to the online system as soon as possible so that payments can issue.<\/p><p>With the organic farming scheme, OFS, our target in the Rural Development Programme was to attract some 16,000 ha of new land into production and to support 46,000 ha of converted land.  We have more than achieved these targets and because of the structures we are putting in place, we hope to secure this land under organic contract for at least the next five years.  For the first time, this allows us to plan ahead with confidence in terms of an organic food market.  OFS payments in 2015 and 2016 amounted to &euro;8 million each year.  Projected expenditure for 2017 is &euro;13 million and the average payment is approximately &euro;6,500.  We are well advanced towards preparations for the 2016 balancing payments, which I expect will commence in October.<\/p><p>In addition to these existing schemes, the new sheep welfare scheme and the knowledge transfer programme are due to issue their first payments since they were introduced last year.  In both cases, payments will commence issuing in the coming weeks.  With all these EU-funded schemes, it is important to note that EU regulations stipulate payments can only issue when the required validation checks have been carried out and passed.  I am very anxious to ensure my Department continues to issue these important payments to farmers in the most efficient and timely manner possible, and this remains a key priority for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300024#W01600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>We know all that money is paid and it is all very welcome but it is of little use or benefit to farmers who are struggling, who cannot get their payments or who are waiting.

However, as we are all aware, there is intense competition for planting land driven by a number of different factors, not least expansion in other agricultural sectors and this is affecting demand for the afforestation scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I am convinced that forestry remains an extremely attractive option for landowners and can serve as a complementary income stream for farmers.  This is because the Department funds 100% of the cost of\u00a0establishing the new forest and guarantees an annual premium of\u00a0up to &euro;635 per hectare payable each year for 15 years, tax free.  Forestry is also compatible with other agriculture schemes and farmers can continue to receive their basic payment on land which is also planted.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of ensuring that\u00a0the benefits of the schemes are clearly communicated and well understood by landowners.  I have established a group jointly consisting of the Department, industry and Teagasc to specifically examine the marketing and promotion of the schemes and this group has met twice already, as recently as yesterday.

In a small number of cases, deforestation is allowed but these are rare and exceptional circumstances, the reasons for which are set out in\u00a0my Department's felling and reforestation policy document.  Examples of situations where forests might not be replanted after clearfelling include overriding environmental reasons or for the erection of ESB lines.

This reduced funding demand is reflective of a number of factors, including initiatives being progressed by my Department in the animal welfare area.  This includes active enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the EU equine identification regulations, which have resulted in the removal of a number of abandoned, welfare-compromised and unidentified horses throughout the country in the period from 2014 to 2017 at a cost of almost &euro;320,000.

The paper contends that economic strength, sustainability, solidarity and security must be focal points for the EU finances of the future and that future budgets needs to be simpler and more efficient and flexible.  This is a principle to which Ireland can subscribe. <\/p><p>However, the paper outlines five possible funding scenarios, ranging from continuing with the current reform agenda to radical redesign, with the consequential effects on EU expenditure and revenue.  Some four of these scenarios point to a potential reduction in the CAP budget.  The paper also refers to a number of options for managing a cut in CAP funding, including reductions in direct payments to farmers, the provision of farm supports only to those under special constraints, and a requirement for member states to co-fund direct payments, which currently are 100% EU funded.<\/p><p>Such proposals would have a significant adverse impact on the economic sustainability of farms or impose a significant additional burden on the Exchequer, especially given that many livestock farm incomes in Ireland would be negative without direct payments.  The certainty and stability the direct payments provide to farmers cannot be underestimated, as has been evident during recent market crises.  Cuts in CAP could also have a negative impact on efficiency and investment on farms, with knock-on impacts on food processing and associated sectors and the rural economy generally.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the amount of CAP funding per member state for Pillar 1, direct payments, and Pillar 2, rural development, is fixed until 2020 in regulations of the Council and European Parliament.  Any change to these figures will require a co-decided amendment to these regulations.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The Commission was expected to come forward with proposals for the new multi-annual financial framework for the period 2021-27 by 1 January 2018.

While formal discussions on the multi-annual financial framework have yet to commence, I support the retention of a strong and well-funded CAP and my position on this matter has been articulated at official and political level and is well understood by the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, my counterparts in other member states and in the Commission.

As Deputy Michael McGrath outlined, there are gaps in terms of a staff room, special educational spaces and toilets and all those issues along with parents trying to travel back and forth between those two sites with their children, who could be split between the two campuses in an area with very heavy traffic, causes huge issues.  There was a debate on other schools that faced similar issues before the recess.  Indeed, this school has been going through this since 2013.  With either temporary or permanent accommodation, it always seems to go right up to the wire or beyond it leaving the board of management to resolve it.  We have been told it is at conveyancing stage.  When does the Minister expect that the sale will be agreed and when will it be in a position to go to planning for the school?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300031#DD00900","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1507050300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I know it is an issue of considerable concern because this school was opened in 2013 and now has enrolment of up to third class so, clearly, finding permanent accommodation for the school is a priority from the Department's point of view.  There were attempts to find a site.  We have been working through the memorandum of agreement with Cork County Council and one site was being pursued.  The current site, which is deemed particularly suitable, is now the preferred the option.  I think the Deputies know that efforts had been made to look for other sites before this one was settled upon.  There was an agreement in principle in February 2017, as the Deputies acknowledged.  The Department then requested draft contracts from the vendor, which was the first step.  The site is not accessible and aspects of the design and delivery of the access road to the site needed to be discussed with the landowner.  In the meantime, work has been ongoing on this.<\/p><p>On foot of these discussions, the vendor provided draft contracts in August 2017 and this enabled the Chief State Solicitor to commence the conveyancing process.  That process has commenced and I am not in a position to say when it will be completed.  The legal people will have to be satisfied that there has been due diligence and such.  I assure the Deputies that there is no attempt to slow this and the Department assures me that while the site acquisition process is going on, it is not hindering the delivery of the permanent accommodation for the school as preliminary design work on the project has commenced.  The design team has already had some engagement about that with officials in Cork County Council and will shortly be holding formal preplanning discussions with the council with a view to further advancing the project.  The Department is acutely aware of the difficulties outlined by Deputy McGrath with the two campuses that parents are trying to deal with.  I assure the Deputies that we will make every effort to conclude this and proceed to the next design stage to provide permanent accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300031#DD01000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507050900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

I do not know how long it takes to purchase a site after the price has been agreed but will the Minister assure us that this is not because his budget for land or site acquisition has been exhausted?  I welcome that preplanning discussions are going to commence, hopefully in parallel with the conclusion of the acquisition phase.  It is possible, however, that until contracts are signed, this site could be lost.  Someone else could come in with a higher bid at any stage because no contracts are signed.

The educate together secondary school is in Nagle.  There are other schools in Carrigaline as well.  Both of those schools go right up to the wire when trying to source things.  There is still great uncertainty, even as the year progresses, as to what the situation will be next year.  There is an admission that we are looking at temporary accommodation for 2018 to 2019 which is disappointing and concerning.  It is not clear to me that either of the existing sites are capable of supporting any more prefabs or temporary accommodation.  The question is whether we are looking at a third site or relocating some of the existing school to another site.  Much of that is unclear and I am disappointed to know that we are in that situation.  I understand that indications have been that it is still at the conveyancing stage but that it could take until the end of the year.  If that is the case, it is very likely that another school year will be spent in temporary accommodation.  I urge the Minister to examine the issue of temporary accommodation and how that is handled in the Department as a general rule on a national level.

Over 890 people were injured in this crackdown on democracy.  Will the Minister of State join me in sending solidarity from this Chamber to those people and to wish them a speedy recovery?

I welcome, as Deputy Crowe has, the Taoiseach's remarks condemning the violence but it concerns me that the Government says that the substance of the difficulties in Catalonia are an internal matter for the Spanish state and that therefore the Government cannot interfere.  That was not the Government's position on human rights and civil liberties in Poland or Hungary recently, or indeed in Myanmar.  The Government has a long history of speaking up and advocating about foreign governments' actions when it feels that they are inappropriate.

In fact, to some extent, there is a justification for talking about it being an internal Spanish matter to be dealt with under Spanish law.  The UN charter and international law are crystal clear on the right to self-determination, but that right is being violently suppressed by the Spanish state, a European state.

The region is also a location I visit a couple of times each year.  What has been said in the debate will be shared with Catalan and other Spanish contacts.  In this way, a range of Irish opinions will be shared.  This is something I welcome.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, said when she spoke on the topic recently, what happens in Spain is of great interest to their Irish friends in this House and the communities we represent across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning all modern democracies.  Ireland respects the constitutional and territorial unity of Spain.  The Government's position remains that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain, as in any country of the European Union, are matters to be determined by its own citizens through its own institutions in keeping with the rule of law.  Political developments in democracies take place within a legal framework.  This is what protects the rights of all citizens.  Respecting the rule of law and the limits it imposes is not a choice but an obligation.  Differences of opinion should be contested robustly by public representatives and others and all parties should do so with full respect for the law and the rights of citizens.  That is the foundation that underpins and protects modern, democratic societies.<\/p>  <p>  I shared the dismay felt by many Irish people at the disturbing clashes and injuries sustained on Sunday in Catalonia.  We know from our own experiences on this Island, as well as from experiences elsewhere, of the particular responsibility borne by the authorities to balance law and order while respecting rights.  Let me be clear: violence has no place in politics.  This has always been the position of the Government.  I echo the call from the European Commission to all relevant players to move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue.  It is important that steps be taken to reduce tensions and reclaim the space where differing political views can be contested through national and regional democratic institutions with full respect always for the law and the rights of citizens.  The events of Sunday last are the subject of extensive debate in Catalonia and across Spain.  Everyone has a responsibility to reduce tensions.  What we are saying in this Chamber mirrors many of the reflections national and regional representatives there, as well as broader society, are putting forward.  We trust our Spanish friends to decide for themselves how to shape their future.  As I stated, what happens in Spain matters very much to us.

They were attacks by one group on another.<\/p>  <p>  There is a misunderstanding of how Catalan society has reached this point.  For over a decade there have been attempts by successive Catalan Governments led by different political parties to find a different kind of constitutional arrangement within the Spanish state, either through greater devolution or now independence.  The difficulty is that the Spanish Government is simply not open to dialogue.  When one hears Mariano Rajoy's responses to the problems on the ground, the Spanish Government made its position very clear yesterday.  What is needed is not a call for dialogue internally but international mediation and influence to be brought to bear, party to party, such as by the Minister of State's party, on the Popular Party in Spain to address the issue and crucially for the European Union to step in and mediate between the Catalan people and their representatives and the government in Spain.

What we saw on Saturday was a shocking, violent suppression of people who were acting peacefully and trying to do so in a democratic way.  The Catalan Parliament made a democratic decision to hold a referendum and the people went out to try to cast their ballot papers and the Spanish state suppressed them violently.  The European is always going on about its commitment to human rights.  This is an elementary human right under international law for people to exercise the freedom to self-determination and the Spanish state is denying it.  What is the Government going to state about this?  What is the European Union going to state about it?

I seek to raise the most urgent issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas.  This project was first approved in 2012.  In July 2013, it was described by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, former Deputy Alex White, as a \"high priority\" location.  In February 2015, it was described by Deputy White's successor, Minister of State and former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as \"remaining a priority despite the planning setback\", which I am sure the Minister of State will outline in his response today.  Following that high profile planning setback from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the lack of impetus and urgency on the part of the HSE to identify an alternative site has been staggering and appalling.  Finglas, as the Minister of State will know well, is one of the most under served areas in the country in terms of general practitioners, GPs, and medical services generally.  There is a dire need for the construction of a primary care centre in this part of the world.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a question that I submitted in 2015, Dublin City Council revealed that it had proposed five alternative sites to the HSE.  That was two and a half years ago but there has been no tangible progress.  In 2017 I corresponded with the HSE regarding this matter, arising from a parliamentary question I had submitted.  The response indicated that a site had been identified but that a decision from the landowners was awaited.  A number of days later, my office received a letter from the landowners stating that they had informed the Department of Health and the HSE that they did not wish for the land to be used for a primary care centre.  The landowners had informed the HSE of same some weeks before I received a contradictory answer from the HSE via my parliamentary question.  <\/p>  <p>  It is now October 2017 and it appears that we are potentially no closer to a solution.  I am hoping that the Minister of State can uses his considerable influence and clout to bring people together and pursue a solution.  It seems that there has been a real problem of co-ordination between the HSE, the Department and Dublin City Council from the outset.  I imagine that is how the erroneous information came to me via a parliamentary question.  It seems that various people within the agencies are not talking to each other.  It would be greatly appreciated if we could bring some urgency and impetus to this most important matter.  I do not need to remind the Minister of State that this primary care centre was promised five years ago.  It was intended to cover more than 15,000 families from St. Margaret's Road to Finglas south.  Finglas south currently has not a single GP.  It is quite clear that not only do the people of Finglas need this, they deserve it.  If we can show our commitment to assisting communities like these by making the plans of the previous Government from 2012 a reality as soon as possible, that will be a job well done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300034#GG00300","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1507052100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Rock for raising the issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas.  Deputy Rock has a long track record in fighting for an improvement in the health services in the Finglas area in particular.  Finglas has been identified as a high priority location for the development of a primary care centre.  Plans for a HSE direct-build centre were approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual capital plan.  Following a review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road in Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new primary care centre.  Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.  The site on Mellows Road was selected because it was a good site.  It was centrally located in the catchment area which it was intended to serve, had good accessibility and was well served by bus routes.  It was a generous green field site that had future expansion capacity.  There would be no impact on current services during the construction period and the location would complement the HSE day care centre on Kildonan Road.  The site would facilitate the establishment of GP services in this area and local GPs had expressed significant interest, in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of the development at this specific location.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the granting of planning permission by Dublin City Council was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s inspector also recommended that planning permission be granted, upholding the Dublin City Council decision.  However, in February 2015, An Bord Plean&aacute;la took the unexpected decision not to grant planning permission for the Finglas primary care centre.  We were extremely disappointed and shocked by this decision, as zoning was appropriate for the proposed development and use.  The single reason given for the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la was the loss of informal open space.  Following the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, HSE estates in conjunction with local primary care services teams have reviewed a number of alternative sites for a new primary care centre in Finglas.  A number of potential sites were identified by Dublin City Council but none were considered to be ideal.<\/p><p>The HSE was made aware of another site in Finglas which would be very suitable for a primary care centre and which would potentially become available for the HSE to purchase.  The HSE is still in discussions with the owners of the site and their agents to establish if their site development options would facilitate disposal of lands to the HSE or the incorporation of a primary care centre into a development at this location.  These discussions are still ongoing and we understand that the owners are still considering their options.  We await confirmation of their position.

I would rather not specify the site in this forum but I imagine that myself and the Minister of State are talking about the same site.  The Minister of State said that all other options will be considered by the HSE in the event that this site is not deliverable and it would seem that now is the time to formulate a plan B.  The planning permission application was turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as outlined in the Minister of State's speech, in February 2015.  We are now two and a half years on from that point but are no closer to getting a solution, even though this project was announced five years ago.  The funding has been ring fenced year after year and the needs of the people in Finglas south and west are no less than they were five years ago.  In fact, those needs are even greater now.  I appreciate that this was not the Minister of State's brief in 2012 nor in 2013 to 2016.  However, his words here today are encouraging and his commitment is commendable.

Deputy Tony McLoughlin is also present, and I know this matter is very close to the heart of Deputy Martin Kenny.  It concerns Sligo Garda station, a regional and divisional headquarters which houses an assistant commissioner, a chief superintendent, a superintendent, 140 garda&iacute; and 20 civilians.  For many years it has not been fit-for-purpose and it was condemned by the regional safety adviser of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in October 2015.  In July 2016 an independent health and safety specialist, Mr. Michael O'Reilly, who was hired by the GRA, also condemned the cells.  Since October 2016 no drinking water has been available.  We all salute the heroics of a number of garda&iacute; who, on no less than four occasions throughout the summer months, saved people from the River Garavogue but did not have a shower to warm them up and clean themselves in afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  This is totally unacceptable and a walkout was arranged by staff in October 2016, although it was deferred on the basis of absolute assurances from management that temporary works would be carried out to make the existing Garda station usable and safe until a new Garda regional headquarters was built.  To this day no works have happened and this is totally unacceptable and an insult to the people of the north-west region.  This regional office is the headquarters for Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Louth.<\/p>  <p>  This is happening against the backdrop of the cynical reopening of Stepaside Garda station.  An apparent leak to the media from a report to which the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, was refused access suggests the decision was based on population increases, which is another dubious retrofit to satisfy political gain.  In Meath, the Garda stations in Kilmessan and Crosskeel have closed while Athboy and Oldcastle are push-button situations.  However, there has been a 59% increase in property theft and an increase in burglaries of 44% in that county.  The county has also had the same increase in population, according to census 2016, as Dublin at 5.9% but Stepaside was a very specific case, at the expense of the likes of Sligo and Meath.  What is the reason for this?<\/p>  <p>  The people cannot take politicians seriously unless they do what they say they are going to do but the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, was in Sligo on 21 August and said we would have a site for the new Garda station within three or four weeks.  This is week six but nothing has happened except an absence of drinking water, condemned cells and prisoners in a regional headquarters being transported 15 miles after public order arrests on a Saturday night.  What is it that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has?  Outside the Step Inn, in the run-up to Christmas 2015, the champion Independent could be seen wearing a Santa Claus hat.  Straddling him was Councillor Kevin Daly holding a sign reading \"Open Stepaside Garda station\".  What happened?  It is reopened based on a spurious criterion while the people of Sligo are forced to suffer and the people of Meath, with the same population increase as Dublin, are dismissed and thrown under the bus.<\/p>  <p>  Does the sum of the Ministers, the Meath Deputies Regina Doherty, Damien English and Helen McEntee, not equal the influence the great almighty himself, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has on Government?  The assistant Whip, Deputy Tony McLoughlin, Deputy Eamon Scanlon, Deputy Martin Kenny and I represent three different political entities and are all committed to the same thing.  Do we have no say?

I also recognise the interest Deputies Scanlon, Martin Kenny and McLoughlin, who has previously raised the matter, have in the issue.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and works closely with the  Garda authorities in this regard.  The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must also have the modern technology and other resources, including fit-for-purpose buildings, necessary to do its job and notes that the capital plan 2016-2021 secured resources in this regard.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant efforts being made by Government to enhance the working environment generally for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and of the major investment that has been committed under the capital plan 2016-2021 to upgrade Garda premises, the Garda fleet and Garda ICT infrastructure.  This is evidenced by the Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021, which is an ambitious five-year programme that will benefit over 30 locations around the country and includes over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the capital plan as well as a major public private partnership project.<\/p>  <p>  Under the programme, a new Garda station is to be provided in Sligo, together with stations in Macroom and Clonmel, by means of public private partnership.  The Deputy will be aware that, in order to secure a suitable site for the Sligo development, the Office of Public Works placed advertisements in local and national newspapers in January 2017 seeking expressions of interest from property owners or developers, with returns received in February 2017.  I am informed that the Office of Public Works, together with Garda estate management, reviewed the submitted proposals in early April 2017 and a number of suitable sites have been identified as possible options for the development.  In this context, the Office of Public Works is now actively progressing the acquisition of a site and I understand that the aim is to reach agreement on the purchase of a suitable site very soon.  The Minister has been advised that, pending the development of the new station, local Garda management and the Office of Public Works have been working closely to develop proposals to improve the accommodation situation in the existing station.  This includes exploring options for the relocation of certain functions outside the station and reconfiguring the premises to meet the needs of front-line operational personnel and to address space or health and safety concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the Minister has been assured that, within every Garda division, there are adequate custody facilities to meet legal standards.  I also understand that other short-term measures have been taken to address and improve the accommodation situation at the station.  For example, works to fully refurbish the toilets above the public office were completed in late July 2016 and a new industrial-standard kitchen facility has been installed.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I want to reassure the House that the Government is fully committed to proceeding with its major investment programme that aims to provide new stations and to modernise older stations at key locations around the country, ensuring a safe, modern working environment for garda&iacute; as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300035#HH00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1507052700,"counter":449,"content":"<p>As is so often the case, all people are equal but some are more equal than others.  Just because Deputies McLoughlin, Scanlon, Martin Kenny and I did not stand bearing gifts, as Santa Claus Ross did outside the Step Inn at Christmas 2015, it seems the OPW is pressing ahead and is at an advanced stage of reopening the semi-derelict building in Stepaside, and this was confirmed by the acting commissioner at the Committee of Public Accounts last week, just to placate the Minister, Deputy Ross, and to keep him on board in the Government.  It seems the Ministers, Deputies Regina Doherty, English and McEntee, can go to hell despite the fact that their county has had the same population increases.  The same applies to Deputies McLoughlin, Martin Kenny, Scanlon and me because nobody cares about the people of the north west.  Here we are again, getting an IOU, which reminds me of \"Dumb and Dumber\" and the promise \"That's as good as money, Sir.\"  The Minister is telling us he has great plans, he will do this and do up the other but nothing has happened yet.  Ask the GRA, ask the detective branch and ask the assistant commissioner.  I do not blame any of them as they are living and working in conditions that are not fit for anybody.  If this was a private sector premises it would have been closed down already but because it is in-house, people are told to keep quiet.  They are told that they will be looked after in due course but the sum of McLoughlin, MacSharry, Scanlon and Martin Kenny, not to mention the three Meath Ministers, Regina Doherty, McEntee and English, does not equal that of Ross.<\/p>  <p>  What does the Minister have to say to the people of Sligo?  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is not the line Minister and I mean no disrespect to him but it is a further example of the contempt shown to the people of Sligo that the senior line Minister does not have the courtesy or the manners to come here to discuss the issue.

Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this provision and the fact that any decision which denies entitlement to a benefit or payment will ultimately be made by a deciding officer.  Currently, those on payments such as disability allowance or a blind person's pension may have the first &euro;120 of their payments disregarded for the purposes of the means test governing eligibility for those schemes even though such earnings are allowable, provided the employment concerned is certified as being of a rehabilitative nature.  In addition to that, moneys earned from the rehabilitative employment between &euro;120 and &euro;350 per week is assessed at 50% under the means test.   <\/p>  <p>  I note that the report of the interdepartmental group established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities provided that the requirement to prove that work is of this nature was unnecessary and such a requirement should be dispensed with.  The Bill acknowledges this recommendation in respect of the earnings disregard for the aforementioned payments.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent SIF report provides that those on disability payments are at various stages of poverty and deprivation to the point that they are lagging far behind that of the general population.  In that regard, I very much welcomed the recent introduction of the Ability programme for young people with disabilities and while this will hopefully assist those who need help to enter into the labour market, we cannot forget those who are already in the system.  We need to move away from placing further restrictions and obstacles in their way.  The Bill goes some way towards this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Fianna Fail spokesperson for disabilities, I have seen first-hand the hardships experienced by persons with disabilities.  Since taking up this position I have continuously called for the formal ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is hard to believe that ten years after signing up to it, it remains unratified.  The Taoiseach told me in this Chamber last week that the Government is taking a different approach from that of the other countries in Europe that have ratified it.  I point out to the Minister of State that it certainly is; it is a very hands off approach.  If it takes this long to implement a measure that was signed in 2007, we will not make many inroads into achieving social inclusion for those with disabilities.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equality of opportunity in order that they can participate in society to the best of their abilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300036#JJ00700","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1507053300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chann Comhairle for this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Its purpose is to provide for amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004.  One of the main provisions of this Bill is to amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 to allow for the publication, on a quarterly basis, of the names and address of persons convicted in a court of social welfare fraud.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not condone welfare fraud in any shape or form, but we do not condone the perception created by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Protection that there was widespread social welfare fraud in his Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All campaign.  That was unfair because while some people engage in fraud most people do not set out to do that.  I have dealt with cases of people who claimed social welfare not knowing they were wrong in doing so.  I know of cases of people have had overpayments of &euro;60,000 and &euro;70,000 who genuinely did not know they were wrong, and they are trying to pay money back.  The vast majority of those in receipt of a social welfare payment are genuine claimants.  We will be tabling an amendment to this Bill to ensure that only those who have been convicted of intentional social welfare fraud in excess of &euro;5,000 will have their names published.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the legislation on the public service cards, I am aware of the widespread opposition to the introduction of a compulsory identity, ID, card.  There are advantages for its introduction.  There are plausible arguments for and against that, but many will vigorously challenge the possible infringements on a person&rsquo;s privacy.  We will be seeking reassurances from the Minister that the questions raised by the Data Protection Commissioner will be addressed in full and that there is full transparency in terms of how the data is collected and, moreover, that people's personal data is properly and safely secured.<\/p>  <p>  The public needs to have full confidence in the public services card and the Department needs to communicate more effectively on this issue.  That is critical.  In this age in which we live it is a very useful card, but people need to know what personal information it holds and who has access to it.  I accept the card has been in operation for those who require social protection services since 2011 and this is not the first time a national identity card was mooted.  In 2009, a report by the then Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended the introduction of a national identity card to coincide with the development of a public services card.  The public services card contains very sensitive data, including biometric information, a person's date of birth and their personal public service number, PPSN.  The databases behind the card will link to a variety of important public services.  Therefore, the databases behind the card will have highly sensitive information such as a person's address, family and medical information, etc.  We need to know who will have access to this information.  Thousands of people could potentially have access, which increases the chances of abuse of the data and the chances of leaks.  There is also no guarantee that the data will not be transferred to outside agencies, private companies and so forth that are supplying public services.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill contains a number of tidying-up measures in various areas, some of which I welcome.  I welcome, in particular, in section 9 the changes being made for those in receipt of a disability allowance, the blind person&rsquo;s pension and certain supplementary welfare payments to remove the rule allowing the disregard of earnings only where employment is of a rehabilitative nature.  At present, those in receipt of disability allowance and the blind person's pension may have the first &euro;120 per week of their earnings disregarded for the purposes of the means test governing eligibility for those schemes.  However, such earnings are allowable provided that the employment concerned is certified as being of a rehabilitative nature.  In addition, income from rehabilitative employment of between &euro;120 and &euro;350 per week is assessed at 50% under the means test.  The report of the interdepartmental group, the Make Work Pay group for People with Disabilities, established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities found that the requirement to prove that work is of a rehabilitative nature in order to avail of the earnings disregard was unnecessary and recommended dispensing with this requirement.<\/p><p> The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, which I welcome.   We need to have a serious debate on pension provision in Ireland.  There is no question but that the pension system is in need of reform.  The Government must get its act together and act to address many of the issues that are causing great distress for pensioners and those coming up to pension age.  There are anomalies that should to be addressed and they arise as a result of the methodology used in the determination of entitlements based on contributions, mainly for women but also for men, where there is a shortfall that means that they are not entitled to the full rate of pension.  Issues such as the anomalies in the calculation of the contributory pension and forcing people who have worked all of their lives to sign on for jobseeker's benefit for one year before they qualify for their pension should be addressed.<\/p> <p> Since my election, I have continued to highlight the pension gap between men and women.  The past four decades have witnessed a seismic change in women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce, but they are still financially less well off than men.  Changes to the contributory pension thresholds that determine how much people receive by way of a State pension have made the position far worse for women.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 to 520.  The measure has worked against many women who spent time out of the workforce.  A new homemaker&rsquo;s credit was approved at the same time which seemed to offset any potential inequality, but it was not sanctioned by the Department of Finance because of the cost involved.  It is crucial that we see the promised homemaker&rsquo;s credit introduced and backdated to the 1970s.  The current scheme was only backdated to 1994 and limited to the care of the children up to 12 years of age.<\/p> <p> We need to move towards a universal pensions system which would give both women and men equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee. The payment rate must provide for a decent standard of living for all.  We have a situation where many people, mainly women, are being denied a full State pension on retirement.  We also have a situation where people are being forced to retire at 65 years but who cannot access their entitlement to receive a State pension until they reach 66 years.  We have a looming pension crisis where the rate of supplementary pension scheme coverage in Ireland is estimated to be only 35% of the working population when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Fine Gael has been in government for seven years and it is time this issue was resolved.<\/p> <p> Financial hardship in retirement has become a real prospect for a lot of women.  While much attention is paid to the gender pay gap, the problem is far more pronounced at pension age, with a pension gap between men and women of about 37%.  I have been contacted by a number of women who are extremely worried about their pension entitlements.  Many of them will not be entitled to receive the full pension payment because they do not have enough paid contributions and are anxious about how this will impact on their pensions.  There is no doubt but that it will have a serious effect on them.  These are individuals who started working and had to give up work to mind children and who then went back into the workforce.  What is happening is very unfair.<\/p> <p> The pension pay gap between men and women amounts to about &euro;700 a month.  In fact, only 16% of women receive the full State pension.  To be paid at the top rate, a person will need a yearly average of 48 paid or credited contributions from 1979.  This means that a generation of women are either on reduced pensions, as they do not have enough contributions to qualify for the full rate, or receive one as a qualified adult which is related to their husband&rsquo;s pension and is not a payment to them in their own right.  We need to move towards a universal pensions system which would give both women and men equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee.  This pension should be at a payment rate which would provide a decent standard of living for all.<\/p> <p> I would again like to voice my concerns about eligibility for the tenant purchase scheme, specifically for those in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The local authority tenant purchase scheme that came into effect in January last year deliberately makes it very difficult for anybody in receipt of a social welfare payment to purchase a house.  No citizen should be excluded from the scheme that is open to social housing tenants on a minimum gross annual income of &euro;15,000.  Under the terms of the scheme, the council will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equal to the discount given, with the charge reducing to zero over time.  Where a local authority house is valued at &euro;150,000 and the applicant&rsquo;s gross annual income is &euro;18,000, a discount of 60% will be given against the purchase price and the applicant will pay &euro;60,000.  The scheme excludes tenants who are dependent on social welfare payments as their primary source of income and it has been set up in a way that deliberately makes it very difficult for anybody in receipt of social welfare payments to purchase a house, which is regrettable.<\/p> <p> Since it was established originally by Fianna F&aacute;il, the tenant purchase scheme has been responsible for the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the State and access should not be denied to any citizen.  Home ownership is good for the families who live in the houses in question and good for the communities in which they live.  Opening up a pathway to home ownership is at the very heart of Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  Ireland cannot afford to have a divided society where home ownership is confined to a few, while the rest struggle with unstable tenure and rent levels.  The right to buy under the tenant purchase scheme has been an important tool in extending home ownership opportunities to low income households.  The option to own a valuable long-term asset has empowered thousands of families across the country and should not be denied to any family or individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300036#JJ00800","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507053900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Michael Collins, is sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300037#KK00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1507053900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath.<\/p><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill.

Those found to be in receipt of excess of &euro;5,000 in fraudulent payments will have their names published.  <\/p><p>With regard to the Civil Registration Act 2004, I welcome the deletion of the Office Registrar, General and deputy registrar general.  The country is top-heavy with unnecessary offices and management that only delay certain processes.  The ending of these restrictive positions is welcome.  This, however, results in the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection being responsible for the provision of birth, marriage and death certificates.  For this reason, I am fearful that the Department may exploit the opportunity as a way to raise income.  Having recently done away with death benefit, I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, to keep the cost of these important documents at the current price, if not to reduce it further, particularly the cost of a death certificate.  We are all well aware of the strain the loss of a loved one can place on a family emotionally, as well as financially, as a result of funeral expenses.  <\/p><p>Changes to the Pensions Act 1990 are also incorporated in the Bill.  I bring to the Minister of State's attention a problem I raised on the floor of the House recently during Leaders' Questions.  It is the issue of pensions for women in the home.  Article 40.2.1&deg; and Article 40.2.2&deg; of the Constitution state:<\/p><blockquote>1&deg; ... that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.<br \/><br \/>2&deg; The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.<\/blockquote><p>I am aware that the Government intends to hold a referendum to amend the article next year.  My point is that we all know plenty of such women who left work after getting married to stay at home and rear their families or take care of parents and in-laws.  They have saved the State millions of euros in child care and carers' fees.  Many of them went back to work for a number of years after their families were reared and now realise they do not have enough stamps to receive a State pension.  While a few of them benefited slightly from the introduction of the homemaker's scheme in 1994, many homemakers in my constituency of Cork South West have brought this issue to my attention at various clinics.  They believe they have been discriminated against.  In fact, they believe that, despite the wording of the article, the State did not go far enough to ensure they would be left in a financially stable position.  They believe they have been left high and dry by the State.  What an awful thing for them to feel having served the State for so long.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this and the earlier issues I mentioned and to treat them in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300037#KK00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1507054500,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these matters related to pensions and the public services card.  As I understand it, there are three pensions Bills to be brought before us in this Chamber in the current term.  They come from Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Willie Penrose and Johnny Brady.  I do not deny any of the three Deputies the right to bring whatever they wish before us in the Chamber as they are elected and have that right but I wonder if the three Bills could be streamlined into one Bill.  There is no doubt but that the pension system needs to be improved in many areas.  We have social welfare inequalities and unfairness in many areas.  It is ridiculous that currently people must retire from many jobs at 65 years of age.  After working for 40 or 45 years, it is ridiculous to think they cannot get the contributory pension until they reach 66 years of age so they go on jobseeker's benefit.<\/p>  <p>  We were all at the ploughing championships and it was great to be able to meet the farming community and people who service the business.  It is a wonderful experience every year to meet people from every part of the country, especially those who go religiously from very rural areas.  Fewer than 50% of these farmers have any preparations made for a pension.  It is only when these men and women reach 65 or 66 years of age that they give any thought to the pension and at that stage, with many of them, their hips, backs and hands are gone and there are fingers missing.  They will have given endless hours to work; more than many people, except maybe those in private business.  They do not have working hours and they go from darkness in the morning until the dark of night.  They work on Sundays and every day of the week.  It is amazing to think that fewer than 50% have any provision for a pension.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggesting a number of weeks ago some new idea he has for a pension.  Farmers certainly need to be looked after as they dedicate their whole life to their farms and their operations.  They must do it.<\/p>  <p>  As mentioned by Deputy Michael Collins, there are many women who, if they have reached pension age since 2012, would not qualify for a full pension.  Maybe some of them are not getting any pension.  I have an example of two sisters who went into the workforce back in the 1970s.  One of the girls worked in the black economy and there were no stamps paid for her while the other girl had her stamps paid.  Both of them reared their families and did not work for a long number of years up until the late 1980s.  They went back to work again and the girl who had the stamps paid will not qualify for a full pension but the girl who was in the black economy and was paid cash will.  That needs to rectified, particularly the way contributions are averaged.  It is not fair and when something is not fair, it is not right.  Many of these women are coming to elected representatives to see what we can do for them.  Our group raised this matter in the D&aacute;il a number of months ago but we were told the money was not there to rectify it as it would cost &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million.  These people are being wronged and this must be looked at again.  This will become an election matter.  The affected people came up here from all over Kerry to highlight the problem.  Will the Minister look at this as the averaging system is wrong and unfair?<\/p>  <p>  Many pension schemes have employers paying in for their employees but they will not benefit the employees.  These pensions need to be clarified.  Employees and employers do not know enough about these pension schemes and they are not benefitting the employees.  Many people are worried about the public services card because they want to know who will have access to the card.  If they do not want to give it to certain people, it is a right that should be upheld.  The matter will not go away and it needs to be dealt with in a fairer manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300038#LL00100","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1507054500,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important matter.  I meet people weekly at clinics and I hear of the recovery but people on pensions and other various payments are, unfortunately, not feeling the benefit of any recovery.  I certainly hope in the forthcoming budget, there will be what I would call a substantial and fair increase for people on different payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is very important.<\/p>  <p>  Today I had three phone calls from families who were not ringing for the fun of it.  They were asking about the bereavement grant and if such a grant was available.  I was very sorry to tell them that there is no bereavement grant but a case may be made individually and people may be able to get some funding.  To be honest, the bereavement grant should never have been taken away and it should certainly be restored.  I heard the Taoiseach today saying we have seen nothing until we see what his Government does over the next period of time.  If he wants to show that his heart is in the right place, he should please restore the bereavement grant.<\/p>  <p>  There is one anomaly that comes up an awful lot, which is where people, through no fault of their own, are affected by some error made in filling out a form.  There is some mistake and there is nothing devious or underhand about it but, all of a sudden, these people might owe the State &euro;500, &euro;5,000 or &euro;15,000.  They are left struggling.  I know that if money is owed to the State, it must be repaid.  There is a minimum amount that can be accepted.  I ask that for people in bad, tough or dire circumstances, the rule be relaxed.  In other words, no case should be the same.  If people find they must repay money to the State, they should at least be given a proper and lengthy opportunity to repay an amount they can afford.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to have my say on women who have worked very hard in homemaking.  I appreciate the homemaker scheme but it is too restrictive as it only takes into account a certain number of years.  People who had families before or after that period are unable to avail of it, which is wrong.  Those people worked hard and brought the next generation into this world.  They should be entitled to a full pension, the same as anybody else as they worked at home, doing what is probably one of the most important jobs in raising their families.<\/p>  <p>  I use this opportunity to pay a very special compliment and tribute to a very important group of people who work as our community welfare officers in different communities, whether it is in Kenmare, Killarney, Gneevgullia, Killorglin or elsewhere.<\/p><p>They are really in touch with their communities and doing great work.  They deal with stressful situations every day and it is not often that they are recognised in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  However, I extend my compliments to them as they are doing a great service for the State.  The one thing I am terrified of is that the great work being done by community welfare officers would be centralised.  They have a great and in-depth knowledge of their local areas and the people they are representing and I want them to be there into the future.<\/p> <p> I support what my brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, said, that the biggest insult of all to a person who soldiered very hard and worked to the age of 65 years is that they are told that there is no transition pension between the ages of 65 and 66 years.  It is an insult.  It is crazy that they are told that they should be retiring but that they must go on jobseeker's benefit.  It is morally wrong and an insult to people who have worked hard.  The transition pension between the ages of 65 and 66 years should be brought back and people treated with the respect they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300038#LL00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507055100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I, too, am happy to speak to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The new Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, introduced the Bill on Second Stage before the recess in July.  I wish her well in her new role.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 has generated significant controversy.  It provides that, \"From the beginning of 2018, a quarterly compilation and publication of the list of persons who have been convicted of an offence under the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill Act 2005 or welfare fraud related offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001...\"  The apparent aim is simply to increase public awareness of the consequence of such activity.  After three months the list will be removed from the Department's website, which will be refreshed.  As many have observed, it is very striking that this particular list is being prioritised over, for example, a list of the bankers and financial wizards who have conned the country out of billions.  Where is the list for them, the white collar criminals who will have our grandchildren paying for the blackguarding with which they got away?  There was no regulation then, or, at most, light touch regulation.  There is one law for the rich and another for the poor; shame and public disgrace for those who in engage in social welfare fraud but protection and anonymity for the high level financial operators.  This is simply not good enough and we wonder why people are cynical about politics.  It is unacceptable in the extreme.  <\/p>  <p>  Another section that has generated significant concern is the one dealing with the public services card and the circumstances in which it will be mandatory.  Much has been made of the Minister's celebrated remark that the card is mandatory but not compulsory.  What is the difference?  Which comes first?  I am not sure that this provided the reassurance for which many were looking.  I do not believe it provided any.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the other aims of the Bill, I certainly agree that it is vitally important that we protect the interests of employees with respect to their defined benefit pension contributions and that we do all that we can to produce a more robust and effective mechanism to ensure that will occur.  I understand the Minister will be introducing amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in this area, but it might be too late for that.  Why are they not in the general body of the Bill?  Many will have found it quite shocking that there has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to engage with trustees and members to address deficits in their defined benefit pension schemes.  This is found to be the case particularly with big business and corporations.  Not enough conditions have been put on employers who wish to terminate their liability to contribute to their defined benefit pension schemes.  We have seen how they have been abandoned and closed down overnight, which is not acceptable.  I am glad that the Minister is intent on introducing clarity in that regard.  We are waiting to see what measures she will introduce.  From what she has previously indicated, the amendment she is intent on introducing will not permit an employer to walk away at short notice.  I hope that measure will be well ring-fenced and supported by legislation because it applies to many big employers who move and change companies.  <\/p>  <p>  The amendments will also provide for a 12-month notification period to enable negotiations and discussions to take place between all sides.  I welcome these amendments.  Where a scheme is in deficit, they will require employers to enter into dialogue with trustees to develop a plan to sustain the scheme.  It is only where these steps fail and no funding proposal is in place that the Pensions Authority will determine a funding obligation in the form of a schedule of contribution amounts and dates by which they will have to be paid.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Minister also noted in her remarks in July, the Bill includes a measure which will confirm the special position within the welfare code of guardians who take responsibility for caring for children who have been orphaned or whose parents are unable to take care of them.  The Bill also includes a measure supporting people with a disability who take up employment.  I will be very interested to hear the thoughts of someone like Senator John Dolan and the Disability Rights Federation.  It is very important that we look closely at this measure and do not just pay lip service to it.  <\/p>  <p>  Like my colleagues, Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, I salute and praise community welfare officers.  The previous Government closed down facilities and stopped community welfare officers from meeting people in places such as health centres and elsewhere and put them all in big offices in a couple of towns.  They withdrew their support from the community and it could not have been done at a worse time when community welfare officers were never needed more.  They are on the front line trying to deal with issues, but they are not available because they have to get taxis to get into towns to meet people who are out of the comfort of their own surroundings.  We must respect community welfare officers and support them and allow them to do the job they have always done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300039#MM00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1507055100,"counter":466,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues dealt with in the Bill that could easily merit a long contribution, not least the fact that the Bill falls very far short of the framework that was launched earlier in the year which promised significant pension reform.  My colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, spoke to the Bill and raised many of the issues surrounding the management of pensions and the plight of workers such as those in Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer&rsquo;s, Independent News and Media and so on.  I will not go over the same territory again.  <\/p>  <p>  Given what transpired during the summer break regarding the outrageous handling of the public services card, that is an area on which I particularly want to focus.  Section 5 of the Bill makes provision for the Minister to issue a public services card where she sees fit.  Departments and systems have to talk to each other, but safeguards are incredibly important and people are very conscious of the need to safeguard their personal data.  The sledgehammer style introduction of the public services card has caused not only confusion, justified anger and fear but it has also severely impacted on some people's welfare payments because they expressed understandable and legitimate concerns about the new system.  I spoke to one applicant who told me that all she was looking for was clarification as to whether it was compulsory to obtain one of these cards.  I know that she has not been paid her pension, something into which she had paid and something she regarded as a benefit she would receive when she sought it.  Instead of taking on board legitimate concerns of citizens about how their personal data would be used or transferred among Departments, or to handlers in other jurisdictions, they were ignored and people found themselves being held financially hostage as their payments were discontinued if they refused to blindly accept the imposition of the public service card.  I do not know if a benefit for which somebody has paid can be legitimately withheld.  If it happened to a politician or in the case of a ministerial pension, the High Court would be invoked as a possible sanction, but it seems that when it is a small individual who is trying to establish his or her rights, there is a difference in treatment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister has repeatedly denied that the public services card is, in fact, an ID card, yet the proposed subsection (1)(d) of section 5 clearly and succinctly states a person may use his or her public services card for the purposes of proving his or her identity to any other person or specified body.  If we are to have an ID card, let us have a discussion about it.<\/p><p>Let us have the discussion about the safeguards around identity cards but let us not do it by stealth.  To watch the Minister ignoring concerns such an ID card, in an age when personal data is a commodity was breathtaking.  Serious concerns exist regarding the digital safety of such information.  I dealt with a woman who had her old age pension payment stopped after she questioned whether it was mandatory to accept the public services card, PSC.  I asked some parliamentary questions and received what can only be described as an aggressive defence of this woman's treatment and the treatment of others like her.  The Minister said on radio that most people were accepting of this.  Why would they not be accepting of it if by refusing to get one of these cards they would not receive their pension?  Further, the reply doubles down on the fact that the PSC is indeed a national identity card and stresses the &lsquo;consequences&rsquo; for those who refuse to get on board with the system.  People need reassurance at the very least.  <\/p> <p> To add serious insult to injury, the reply also confirms that people who had the audacity not to blindly swallow the Government's line, and who dared to pose questions and express concerns, not only had their payments stopped but will not have those amounts backdated when their payment resumes.  I find that astonishing because it is a benefit if a person has paid into it and meets the qualifying criteria.  I do not understand how a person's pension can be discontinued without addressing that.  Essentially, those persons find themselves penalised substantially for daring to raise legitimate concerns.<\/p> <p> Another area where there are significant legitimate concerns is JobPath.  A significant section of this Bill concerns itself with the area of social welfare fraud and identifying those working while claiming payments.  I am certainly not justifying anybody doing that but it appears very little consideration is given to finding ways to accommodate those people who are actively engaging with the system but want to activate themselves in the jobs market.  <\/p> <p> I am dealing with a case where a father of two was referred to JobPath in 2016.  This referral happened despite the fact that he had declared himself a casual worker, in that he could pick up a few hours here and there and have his social protection payment reduced accordingly.  Upon being sent to register for JobPath he was told, on the registration day, that he was not a suitable candidate yet they registered him anyway.  Had he refused to be registered his social protection payment would more than likely have stopped although he did not have the casual work.  The obligations placed on him by the Department required him to attend at times notified to him, even if those times clashed with working hours he had been offered.  He consistently raised this issue with the team and told them he was at risk of losing the bit of work he had if they refused to help manage the times accordingly.  He was rebuffed and ignored.<\/p> <p> Even more worrying, he was asked to sign documents asking him to verify attendance at sessions which he had not attended.  When he expressed concern at signing something he knew not to be true he was told not to worry about it and that he had to sign in order to get paid.  He had specifically requested a truck training programme and was refused and instead sent on a Private Security Authority, PSA, licence course which cost the same amount of money but had poorer work prospects for him.  He was coerced into the training with the promise of a job at the end of but no such job ever materialised.  He was prohibited from accepting any other external offers of employment during the training time and threatened with sanctions if he accepted work outside the JobPath scheme.<\/p> <p> Eventually, he and his wife decided that it would be more prudent for him to take the risk of accepting a job and that is what he did.  He then found himself pestered by Seetec, the JobPath organising company, to get his new employer to fraudulently fill out forms claiming JobPath had got him the job.  The employer was contacted on several occasions.  JobPath did not get him the job but he and his new employer were repeatedly harassed to the point that the employer eventually signed the forms to get it off his back.  The man in question felt that he had to speak out and highlight what is going on in this scheme.  This is not a client centred labour market activation programme.  This is a programme for profit.  The same company is having significant difficulties with the legal system in Scotland. <\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to look into issues such as the public services card.  Much more thought has to be given to some of the people who have fallen foul of this.  It is not acceptable that people who have paid all their lives cannot get their pensions because they do not want to engage with the public services card but can provide alternative identification through a passport or a driving licence.  They do not feel confident enough about the card and have not received enough answers on it.  <\/p> <p> The JobPath scheme merits a serious review from a citizen's perspective rather than looking to penalise and punish.  There are other things within the Department that are costing money and which are not what they were intended to be.  JobPath deserves that kind of scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300039#MM00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507055700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The priority of this Bill should have been to reverse the savage cuts and austerity that the past two Governments visited on ordinary people.  Instead, this legislation is taking the opportunity to demonise social welfare recipients.  The dishonest claim of high levels of fraud was a cynical tactic used by the then Minister for Social Protection to promote himself and his recent campaign for Taoiseach.  There is a very low level of fraud in this country.  Research shows that the largest proportion of funding lost is lost through administrative error, some customer error but not fraud.  The fraud levels here compare very favourably with the 2% to 5% levels in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America and New Zealand.   The proposals in this Bill for publication of names, addresses, fines and penalties make no distinction between someone who has been convicted for a relatively minor offence and someone who has habitually committed serious fraud.<\/p>  <p>  Recovery of overpayments is a question I come across regularly at clinics.  Most of these are due to administrative error or errors by applicants.  Thankfully the Government's proposal to recover 25% and recover repayments by way of that deduction has been dropped from the legislation.  The situation is very difficult and needs to be reviewed.  The Department is allowed to deduct 15% from the social welfare rate for overpayments.  That is being used as the normal and only rate of deduction, in most cases without any consultation with the applicants.  In many cases where there is consultation, and that is a small percentage, it was implemented before the applicant made his case and returned it to the Department.  It has been automatically deducted.  That is wrong and should be reviewed by the Minister and stopped.  If there is an overpayment to a person on jobseeker's allowance of &euro;193 a week, whether through administrative error or an error on the part of the recipient, 15% is routinely deducted.  That person loses just under &euro;29 a week and receives a payment of &euro;164.05.  It is not possible to live on that.  That needs to be examined urgently. <\/p>  <p>  A new unit was set up some time ago to trawl for overpayments.  It goes back years.<\/p><p>I have seen cases where it went back 21 years, and looked at situations that were closed off for that length of time.  They are also trawling back that far for very small sums of money.  That should be looked at.  If something has been dormant for five, ten, 15 or 20 years, it should be written off.  How can anyone make their case years down the line.  It is very difficult to retain documentation.  It is very difficult for someone to make his or her case when they are trying to account for something so far down in the past.<\/p> <p> I have concerns about the public service card.  It is moving in the direction of a mandatory identity card.  If it is to be introduced, it must be done on a voluntary basis.  How secure is the data on these cards and who and what agencies have access to it?  Now that we are outsourcing some social welfare schemes, will these private companies which are operating on behalf of the Department entitled to receive the recipients' data that is held on these cards?  That should be examined.  <\/p> <p> Turas Nua and the JobPath programme is completely inflexible.  Once one is referred to one of these schemes, one cannot take up another scheme.  I dealt with a case recently where a man was interviewed for a CE scheme on a Friday, told on Monday he had a place on the scheme and would start on the following Monday, but then on Tuesday he had a letter from Turas Nua to say that he had been referred to its scheme the previous week.  It was the first he heard of that but he was not allowed to take up his place on the CE nevertheless, despite interventions across the board.  I know from talking to Deputies in the House that this is happening across the country.<\/p> <p> Others have raised the situation faced by women regarding the State pension.  This is something that I come across regularly at my clinics as, I am sure, do other Deputies.  The regulations were changed by the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Joan Burton, of all people.  Now we have a situation where women who had breaks in their employment to work at home to rear their children now find themselves with either no pensions or their pensions are significantly reduced.  That is not good enough.  If nothing else, the Government should take the opportunity of this Bill to deal with this question and ensure that women who were in employment and then looked after their children and reared them at home and then returned to work are entitled to their full pension, as was the case.<\/p> <p> I agree with other Deputies that the qualifying age should be re-examined.  It was another austerity measure introduced by the Labour Party in the last Government.  We now have a situation where State pensions are not paid to people until they are 66 years and there is a hiatus between 65 when many people have to leave employment and 66 years.  In the future, the age will increase to 68 years and recent reports that there is talk that it will be 70 years.  The pension age should be returned to 65 years and people should have the option to work on if they wish.  This should be looked at in this Bill.<\/p> <p> One category of social welfare recipients who were badly hit in the years of austerity through cuts introduced by Deputy Joan Burton were one-parent families.  We know that poverty is rampant among one-parent families.  There are children who go to bed and to school hungry.  This is supposed to be a republic of opportunity.  The Minister and the Government should now take the opportunity in this Bill to reverse the cuts that were made because they are causing havoc in one-parent families, especially for the children.  The situation in which one-parent families, and particularly the children, find themselves is a disgrace to the State.<\/p> <p> I wanted to refer to a number of other areas quickly, although my time is running out.  The Department is effectively promoting the payment of social welfare payments through banks.  That should be stopped and promote their payment through An Post services throughout the country.  It is a vital service in rural Ireland.  If the social welfare payments are removed or significantly reduced we will see hundreds of post offices close in rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p> The right of social welfare recipients to purchase local authority houses should also be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300040#NN00200","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507056300,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Social Welfare Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  It makes amendments to the social welfare legislation, the Pensions Act and the Civil Registration Act.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak briefly on the Civil Registration Act and will concentrate on the amendments relating to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  My question for the Minister is one that he might answer at Committee Stage.  What is a waiting time for the issuance of birth, marriage and death certificates by the civil registration authority.  There are considerable delays and it has got worse in recent times.  I am aware of people being affected by this in my constituency.  These are mothers who are badly in need of the qualified child allowance and child benefit when a new child is born, and they have to wait weeks on end to have their birth certificate issued from the local office.  Those delays are new, I never encountered them before but I am seeing it this year.  I ask that the Minister of State investigate this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  Another matter that has arisen on the civil registration offices is the delays for people to get an appointment of the civil registration of their intention to marry.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question on this matter earlier and I am sure I will receive a response shortly.  I have asked for a timetable on an office-by-office basis around the country.  I hear that people are choosing the office in which they register because they hear that there is a big waiting list in their own county but the next county is not so busy.  We are seeing all sorts of funny things.  Again, it I have only encountered this issue this year.  It is something I would like to have investigated.  <\/p>  <p>  When I get a letter from the civil registration office, it is on HSE headed paper.  I know that this legislation is under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but it seems to be run through the HSE offices.  I know the Department is responsible, but I do not know how one tallies with the other and there does not seem to be a clear line between the two.  Historically, it may have been through the HSE but the Department has legal authority in this issue and it should check with the HSE that it is administering these issues on its behalf in the regional offices and investigate the delay.<\/p><p>That is all I have to say about the Civil Registration Act side of the legislation.<\/p> <p> I will now come back to the substance of the legislation, which is designed to deter and reduce fraud in the social welfare system by providing for the publication on a quarterly basis of the names and addresses of persons convicted in a court of social welfare fraud.  Nobody in the House stands over social welfare fraud.  Everybody in the House must accept that people are defrauding the State, taxpayers and their neighbours of money, and this must be followed and pursued and they must pay it back.  However, there is a remarkable imbalance in the legislation, and this legislation can be considered fair and reasonable only if it is balanced.  It is fair enough in some respects, in so far as it goes, but I contrast this with what we have had at the Committee of Public Accounts in recent months.<\/p> <p> Allegedly, &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million is due to the Department because of overpayments.  There are various categories of overpayments.  The Government is introducing legislation to chase these down and that is fine, but there should be similar legislation in terms of following and chasing down funds due to the redundancy and insolvency fund under the remit of the Department.  An exact equivalent amount of &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million is allegedly due to the State, based on the amounts the Department records in its accounts, which come to the Committee of Public Accounts every year.  I understand the majority will not be collected because many of the companies where the State paid statutory redundancy have gone bust, been liquidated and gone out of business, and some will take time.  However, some of them are back on their feet and some of the companies have had restructuring.  Some of these companies are now very strong and some are very profitable, and this is money that is due to the State.  The Department has no mechanism whatever to follow this money.  It makes a paltry effort.  We have had it at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department does not even know the details.  This matter has moved from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment because it was about redundancy and it was not really interested in it.  That Department was more interested in giving out grants and not chasing up this issue.  It has now landed at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and there is no interest in the Department.  We asked questions at the Committee of Public Accounts and no significant information is coming through.  I reiterate that the majority of what is allegedly owed needs to be forensically examined, and what is owed should be chased and what is not possible to collect we must face up to and it is only a figure on a sheet of paper.<\/p> <p> I understand 10% to 15% of the fund comes through every year by way of people making payments back to the fund.  I asked at the committee meeting about the fact this fund, this debt to the Government, does not show up.  In other words, the debt people have due to alleged overpayment is shown on the State balance sheet as money owed to the State, but the money owed by employers to the redundancy and insolvency fund is miraculously excluded from the balance sheet of the State because somebody takes the view that if we get something we get something and if we do not we do not, so no real effort is made to follow it.  It is referred to as a contingent asset and it is not recorded on the Government balance sheet and there is no real effort.  I would like to see a balance in terms of examining this and seeing how much is owed and then dealing with this.  If it is not owed we should be truthful about it, but some of it is owed and no adequate information is being obtained to follow it through.<\/p> <p> I asked a simple question, that surely the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can contact Revenue about a company and whether it is still trading and making VAT returns.  It is very simple.  There could not be anything more simple.  Revenue is outstanding in chasing money on deposit interest retention tax and showing people with deposits in bank accounts in Ireland, England and other countries, and telling the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that people in the system claiming money actually have deposits of &euro;30,000 or &euro;50,000 which they have not declared.  Revenue is able to give great information to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but the Department does not seem to be able to say here is a list of companies that may owe it money and ask whether or not they are trading.  If they are not trading that is fine, but the Department does not even know how to ask the question.  I am just saying this legislation is not fair.  It goes after the little guy who owes a small amount of money and ignores the big guy, but that is the Fine Gael way and I must be straight.  That is why we have this legislation.  It is the Fine Gael way to go after the little guy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is smiling.  He can prove me wrong by including an equivalent measure in the legislation to chase employers who owe money to this fund and have not paid it.  If he does this I will accept the balance and I will be happy to withdraw the comment at that stage.<\/p> <p> The legislation is a bit of a charade.  It is part of Leo's trick that he will be hard on social welfare.  He said when he was at the Department that he would pass legislation, and we have it coming through now.  The essence of this is to issue the names on a quarterly basis of people who have been convicted in court.  Every court conviction is public record anyway.  They are in the local and national newspapers.  The Government will publish a list of something that is in the public record.  It is sham and a charade and it is shallow, but it achieves the political aim to try to frighten and in some way cast aspersions on people in receipt of social welfare payments and try to categorise them all in this way.  It will not put a name in the public arena that is not already in the public arena as a result of a court hearing and court conviction, because if people are not convicted they will not be published.  I believe I have made my point on what I think on this.<\/p> <p> Turning to other aspects of the Bill, section 7 is very important as it provides that decisions which deny entitlement to a benefit or payment must in all cases be made by a deciding officer.  I want the Minister of State to think about this carefully.  I do not believe we are on a sound legal footing here.  Somebody applies for carers allowance, and the medical report states the person requires X amount of care, and the medical officer or qualified doctor states the person is entitled to it, and a deciding officer of I do not know what grade in the Department, perhaps administrative officer or assistant principal officer, with zero medical knowledge will be able to make a decision to overrule the medical evidence.  This has to be re-examined.  I understand there are potential court cases on this issue at present, whereby medical opinion has said one thing but the deciding officer has said another and the question is who is entitled to make a medical opinion.  Most people would have thought it would be a person with a medical qualification, but the Government wants to stitch this in here, so that in all cases, and that is the reason it is here, it is ensured the medical person's view is not the view that prevails at the end of the day.  If an administrative officer wants to overrule a medical opinion the legislation specifically provides a mechanism to do this and I believe it is wrong.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to revisit this.  What is the Government trying to close off here?  There must be some parallel mechanism whereby the medical evidence stands on its own two feet.  Perhaps it must go for a higher medical opinion in the Department.  The Department recently recruited a number of doctors to examine some of these cases on the disability entitlement of a person being cared for, but administrative officers should not make the decisions on people's severe medical conditions.  It is that simple.  I do not believe the Minister of State can stand over this provision in the Bill, bar that the Government is trying to close off what is common sense, but it is a bit of an inconvenience for the Department to allow a medical officer make a medical decision.  The Government needs to re-examine this.<\/p> <p> With regard to section 8, I understand what is being said but I want to put a bit more into the public arena on this issue.  It states that where an insurance company will pay up the money in a case where somebody had an injury or a disease, there is a mechanism whereby if the person has been in receipt of a payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection the Department can obtain the money directly from the insurance company because the State was already paying it before the case came to be settled by the insurance company.  This legislation allows for the first time ever that payments to a person in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance can be added into the mix of what can be recouped from the insurance company.  I have no problem with this and it makes sense, but I ask the officials to consider some of the cases I have dealt with.<\/p> <p> The other half of the equation - in several cases and I have been to an appeals officer who has overruled the decisions of the Department's deciding officers - includes cases where people have had to take the HSE to court for medical negligence.  Where the State Claims Agency took the case, the person is awarded &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 as the case may be, and immediately when that money, which is as a result of the medical negligence of the State, is received people lose their social welfare entitlement because they have means.  I have asked a series of parliamentary questions with regard to health, the HSE, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Minister for Finance on whether some provision can be made to calculate the amount of the lump sum to be given when it is accepted there is medical negligence such that it will not in some way reduce the person's entitlement to a social welfare payment.<\/p><p> I had a case in this regard that I am thankful was overturned by the appeals officer, who saw sense and the foolishness of the legislation.  A lady lost a child at delivery due to medical negligence and eventually, years later, got a settlement, which was paid into her bank account.  She believed she received the amount in question from the State because of the State's medical negligence towards her but, lo and behold, the Revenue Commissioners informed the Department of Social Protection she had money in the bank and the latter came after her stating she had been claiming money to which she was not entitled and that she owed it &euro;30,000.  The State gave the woman &euro;100,000 because of its medical negligence and another arm of the State came around to take &euro;30,000 of it back.  It was inhuman.  They put the woman through torture several times.  She lost her child and then had to go to the courts and get a settlement.  Then, a couple of years later, she got a letter from the Department of Social Protection, and she had to go on her hands and knees begging and crying. It was unfair what was being done.  She had the money and one arm of the State sought to take back what the other was giving because of the State's negligence.<\/p> <p> We are very quick to call money back from the supplementary welfare allowance side, which I understand, but this must be balanced against circumstances where a person is being given a payment by the State.  I accept the State Claims Agency is not within the Minister of State's purview.  I have confirmed by way of responses to parliamentary questions I have asked that the State Claims Agency is not allowed, by legislation, to take into account any knock-on effects that the granting of the lump sum for medical negligence by the State can have on one's entitlement to a social welfare payment.  There is a lack of follow-through.  This legislation is fine but it is only half the picture.  If the Minister of State wants to be balanced, he has to balance up what he is doing with some acknowledgement of this issue.<\/p> <p> I had another case that was exactly the same.  It involved a woman with a hand injury who got &euro;100,000.  I have encountered a couple of these cases.  It is remarkable to note all the people who received money through the State Claims Agency because of medical negligence but who had money taken back by the Department of Social Protection, be it the disability allowance or whatever allowance they were then on because of the State's negligence.  They are told they have money, thus affecting their payment.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking.  I ask the Government to stop the practice of the State giving with one hand and taking with the other.<\/p> <p> The issue of the public service card has arisen extensively in regard to this legislation.  The issues raised by the Data Protection Commissioner have to be taken into consideration and fully answered.  Funnily, even if I am in a minority around here, I must state the public service card is a good idea.  It might not be politically popular to say that.  I have simple view: if one wants to interact with the State and wants a service from the State, the latter is entitled to have one mechanism by which one identifies oneself.  People say that is a breach of this, that and the other but if there were proper data protection measures in place, it would be a correct approach to take.  We all give out that, every time one goes to a different State agency, one has to have a different mechanism to prove one's means and who one is.  The idea behind the card is good and my problem is that it is not going far enough.  Let me state why.  Some 100,000 of the 300,000 public servants work in the health service, which is the biggest arm of the State, and the HSE is now spending tens of millions of euro to introduce a new patient identification number system for patients in any hospital in the State such that if one is from Dublin and has a car crash in Cork, one's record can be found from the patient identification number.  Lo and behold, that number is not the same as one's public service card number.<\/p> <p> It gets worse in the HSE.  It has 1.6 million people in receipt of medical cards, using a different numbering sequence that is not connected to the patient identification number or the public service card number.  Therefore, I believe there is a lack of follow-through and logic in Departments.  I understand from my discussions with the various Departments that some genius will be paid millions to write a software programme to match up a patient identification number with the PPS number in some way.  It is not designed for this.  The medical card number, the patient identification number and the PPS number should be one and the same.  I know I will get run out of this House for talking common sense but I believe that makes eminent sense, and I ask people to consider the practicalities when one is dealing with the State.  It would make everybody's life easier, including the people with the medical cards or patient identification numbers.  I ask that the Government consider joining up all the public sector numbers that are on cards related to different arms of the public service.<\/p> <p> I reiterate what Deputy Healy said about discrimination against women in respect of their contributory State pension.  We all know of such cases.  I had a case involving a lady who once did three weeks' work during summer holidays and then went to college in England and got married.  When she came back, she was told she had a 40-year record on which her average would be checked.  She was then told that, lo and behold, she was entitled to nothing because she did three weeks' work when she was 18 on a summer holiday.  It is wrong, it is immoral, it is anti-women and anti-family.  I hope that if the Department does not address this, somebody will take a case to the Supreme Court.  The current arrangement will not stand a minute because it is totally discriminatory.  I ask that this be dealt with.<\/p> <p> Much of this legislation is about the issue of arrears.  I have encountered cases in this regard.  Where someone is making an application for any new payment, the Department checks whether arrears are due.  I have encountered people who worked for their lives and were told all of a sudden, on applying for the State pension, that they owed &euro;8,000 from 12 years previously because, during a summer period, they claimed for their wives when they had part-time jobs.  The applicants respond by asking why the Department did not tell them that when they were working with a salary and had the means to pay it.  They tell the Department it waited until they retired and that it now wants the money taken from their pension.  The administration of the arrears system by the Department of Social Protection leaves an awful lot to be desired.<\/p> <p> I will say more at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts because I have the chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  There are 130,000 cases of people who owe &euro;100 or so.  Remarkably, as I said on television some nights ago, there are 10,000 people who owe an average of &euro;30,000 each, which amounts to &euro;300,000,000.  The Minister of State should get on his bike and chase the money down.  If it amounts to so much in the cases in question, it should be collected where it is due.  If it is not due, let us acknowledge that.<\/p> <p> In regard to all the lists the Taoiseach wants to have published, last year there were 167 convictions in court in respect of prosecutions under the Social Welfare Act.  That amounts to a couple per week.  We are passing legislation in this D&aacute;il for those 167 people whose names are already in the public arena having been through the courts so that the Taoiseach can actually put their names in the paper.  It is pathetic; that is all I have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300041#OO00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507057500,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is fair to say it is a tidying-up exercise.  There are many tidying-up measures in it in terms of the various areas of social welfare schemes.  I welcome some of the measures, in particular the changes to be made for those in receipt of disability allowance and the blind person's pension.<\/p>  <p>  One issue I want to speak about is the implications of the Bill for Irish emigrants returning from England.  Some people who were born here, educated here and worked here and who, through no fault of their own, were forced to emigrate to seek employment in the 1970s, 1980s or another time are now back.  In some cases, they are elderly and in bad health and cannot claim a social welfare payment, or they find it extremely difficult to claim one.  For this group, the bar is raised very high.  The habitual residency clause is used and the affected individuals have to establish where their centre of interest is, their employment history, the length and continuity of their residence in Ireland, the continuity of their residence in another country, and their future intentions.  The guidelines do state that a person who has previously been habitually resident in the State and moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his or her long-term residence in the State \"may be regarded\" as being habitually resident immediately on his or her return.  It does not state \"will be regarded\".  It should be changed to the latter.  It seems that the affected are getting a double blow in that the habitual residency clause is being used such that they have to prove their case, which can take a considerable period.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue concerns the children of Irish emigrants who come here to live.<\/p><p>I dealt with a case a number of years ago where a person returned to Ireland to care for an elderly citizen, her grandmother.  She has no intention of returning to live in England, but faces significant difficulties.  The person concerned is related to one of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation, which is somewhat ironic given what happened.  I do not want to name which one because it will identify the person.  There was nobody else to look after the woman's grandmother.  She has spent a lot of time in County Offaly over the years, travelling back and forwards, and developed a special relationship and bonded with her grandmother, relatives and extended family.  She was deemed not to be habitually resident in the State and faced significant problems in trying to make any headway.  She was <i>persona non grata <\/i>for a number of years.  I am highlighting the case because while I understand EU rules prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality we need to have some balance.  I do not want to be nativist but we need to consider those who have emigrated.<br\/><br\/>One person who returned to Ireland was housed by an approved housing body, a small housing co-operative.  Despite having a lease the person had difficulty establishing habitual residency.  Such issues need to be considered.  The rules seem to be very unfair.  People have worked hard here for a period of time and, through no fault of their own, emigrated.  They may return home following the loss of a relative in order to be with their extended family in the later years of their lives or may have fallen into bad health.  I ask that such cases be examined.<br\/><br\/>I refer to women's pension entitlements.  The Minister of State was not the relevant Minister in the previous Government.  I and, I am sure, the Minister of State are aware of a number of cases in our constituency offices of women who left the workforce due to childbirth.  There was a marriage bar in the public sector for married women during the more Taliban period of our history which, thankfully, we have moved out of.  We need to deal with the situation. <br\/><br\/>The changes made by former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, discriminated against women and penalised them because they were forced out of work due to the marriage bar or child minding duties.  In those days there were no child minders or cr&egrave;ches, things were difficult and families were bigger.  Such situations necessitated one person being in the home, typically a woman.  It was not ideal that they were forced into that.  It is time that we examined the issue.<br\/><br\/>There is a cost involved which is, I understand, approximately &euro;60 million.  I am open to correction, but I read such a figure in recent research.  The figure may be higher.  We need to move on the issue because we should bring the women affected back into the system.<br\/><br\/>There is a lot of huffing and puffing and false information about single parents.  There is fraud in every area, and I am not here to stand over that.  Any parent who runs a house on &euro;220 week, gets a child to school - in particular if he or she is attending secondary school and needs shoes or anything else - and is able to keep a roof over their heads is doing well.  People are paying top-ups for private rental accommodation because we do not have rent controls, in particular in the constituency I represent.  Those living in social housing should get medals by the time they have paid for everything.  <br\/><br\/>We need to re-examine the income disregard related to returning to work in order to allow people to return to the workforce.  A seven-year old child is not old enough look to look after himself or herself, regardless of what subsidies are available.  There are question marks over what can be done in respect of childcare.  We saw what happened in cr&egrave;ches following recent initiatives.  Initiatives to subsidise child care are welcome.  The problem is that many are being absorbed through increased costs.  We need to examine how we can balance the system and  get the best return for State money. <br\/><br\/>We are in favour of child care assistance and making it easier for women, in particular, to get back into the workforce.  Things are very difficult for single parents.  There are difficulties around the 14 or 15 weeks of the year when children are not in school.  Some separated people, usually women, have two or three children and are trying to manage those situations. <br\/><br\/>The cut-off threshold needs to be examined.  I am not trying to pick on the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, but it was during her term of office that the age was reduced to seven.  As a parent and grandparent, I would not like seven-year olds to be left with just anybody or to wander the streets all day if I was going to work.  We need to try to provide some extra support to lone  parents.<br\/><br\/>We also need to stop the trail of misinformation.  People have come to my office about different issues and have referred to lone parents.  There is no doubt that there is fraud in every system.  When I point out to them that parents are running households on &euro;221 a week they are gob smacked and cannot believe it.  They think I am not telling them the truth and I have to show them the rate book in order for them to understand the payments.  They should get more.  Let us make it easier for people to get back to work and try to give them child care support to enable them to do so.  The age limit is too low.  I have seen the effects in my neighbourhood, where women are trying to juggle and hope they can work through the summer until the children are ready to return to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100300043#QQ00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507058100,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I recognise the Bill as, in the main, positive.  There are changes in it which reflect the fact that our social welfare system is quite complex.  Whenever changes are made there can be unforeseen circumstances and not all of the intended changes can be captured in the legislation.  Some of the Bill is a tidying-up exercise because legislation has given rise to the need to delete a duplication.  In other cases, two or three different Acts need to be dealt with.  I understand the civil registration aspect of the Bill deals with one of the changes where there is a mention of an ard cl&aacute;raitheoir.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague mentioned one of the unforeseen consequences.  In 2011 we debated the increase in the number of contributions required to qualify for the contributory State pension from 260 to 520 and the change to whole-of-work-life measures.<\/p><p>We are changing the nature of pension provision in the Bill.  The problem is that there is no mention of it because we never discussed it.  The reason we did not discuss it is because it was quite traditional at the time for the social welfare Bill to be rushed through or guillotined so we never reached it.  We never reached it on Second, Committee or Report Stages so there was no discussion and teasing out of the implications of some of the changes.  I welcome that for the past number of years, at the very least, there has been no attempt to guillotine Bills and we can properly tease out their effects.  I recollect that I mentioned that I have a problem with this; I do not know what is.  That might sound silly in some ways but because of the complexities of our pension system and our social welfare system, my gut instinct was this was going to affect a certain cohort if it was introduced as quickly as it was because it came into effect a year later.<\/p> <p> All of us with constituency offices can see women in particular turning up and asking what happened because they do not have a full contributory pension.  Yes, they can apply for the non-contributory pension but it has affected them and I would appeal to those looking at this to make a greater effort to inform people in advance.  I know some people in the pensions section have made an effort to inform people in advance that they are short but there are a lot of people who will not be informed early enough to allow them to make up the difference to reach the 520 contributions.  In one person's case, thankfully, she was informed early enough and had three months in which to make up three contributions.  It does not sound like much.  She had 517 contributions and was told seven years previously that she had enough contributions at 260.  As far as I remember, she had 500 credits - whatever use they were to her because they were useless in terms of contributions.  She managed to get an employer to take her on for three weeks at the age of 65 or 66, managed to make up the amount and was assessed based on lifetime contributions.<\/p> <p> The second part - the lifetime contributions - was interesting because she had taken a number of periods off for childbirth and to look after her children and that affected the full amount.  I will not tease out all that but I congratulate those in the pensions section who have the foresight to look at people's pensions in advance and inform them.  There is no system, as there was years' ago, where someone could buy the contributions.  Perhaps that could be looked at again and a cost put on it.  Perhaps it is too costly or complicated but perhaps it could be looked at, particularly in cases where people are falling short by ten or 20 contributions in terms of qualifying for payments they made, because at the end of the day, some of these people worked for 30 years but it might have been a case of ten weeks here and ten weeks there.  It takes 24 weeks to qualify.  <\/p> <p> Section 19 records the country of birth and citizenship when somebody dies.  It might be worth recording citizenships because some people go through a number of citizenships.  The explanatory memorandum mentions that this might be used in the future.  I know people who are Pakistani or German and who then became Irish citizens.  There are people who have moved around.  It is a simple change that could be looked at.  <\/p> <p> The guardian's payment is a very good step but I have a problem with the fact that it still mentions orphans.  The reason why it is called a guardian's payment is because of a campaign by myself and others to stop it being called an orphan's allowance.  It talks about giving a payment to an orphan but in many cases, the people concerned are not orphans.  They are the children of people who are not in a fit state to look after so to all intents and purposes, they are abandoned but the Government is not going to use the term \"abandoned children\".  It is about language.  It was not accepted that this was the reason for the change.  <\/p> <p> The issue of welfare cheats is one of the key issues.  As my party's spokesperson on social welfare for a number of years, I argued for more social welfare inspectors and still do.  There is no reason for the change here.  If someone is convicted of welfare fraud in a court of law, every single newspaper up and down the country will publish their name.  The tabloids will broadcast it to the world so it is superfluous.  If one wants a register, that is fine but one needs to be very careful going down this road because an appeal takes place later on.  A person can be convicted today but they will have a number of months in which to put in an appeal.  If we put that person's name on a register, we are condemning them.  I give the example of a woman who came to me in absolute distress.  The Department was looking for &euro;20,000 from her for overpayments for 13 years.  She asked me whether I still had a document she gave me 13 years' ago.  The data protection people here told me I should not have it and that it was in breach of data protection regulations.  I had the document, which was from the Department and which stated that former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, had sent this letter, which was attached to it and said to sort this out and pay this woman the money and recognised the conditions and whatever else.  This was the proof she needed to show that she did nothing untoward when the Department told her she had pulled the wool over its eyes and had never mentioned it.  It was there in black and white 13 years later.<\/p> <p> We should be careful.  I heard Deputy Michael Healy-Rae talk about overpayments earlier.  We are going back years  If I overpaid the tax man, I would only be allowed to go back four years.  Beyond that, the tax man can keep it whereas it is different when the State makes an overpayment even when it is the State's fault.  In many cases we talk about, and we have had this argument before, it happens because of bureaucratic mistakes.  Sometimes it happens because the person did not provide the documentation on time and sometimes it is fraud.  If it is fraud, we should prosecute and recover it.  I have no problem with that but we should be very careful when it comes to going down the road of the State becoming another court of law.  There is enough bad material appearing in newspapers that leads to these people being sued.  We do not want to contribute to that by publishing names ahead of schedule.  If they are guilty of fraud, so be it.  As I said, the newspapers will condemn them.  <\/p> <p> In respect of the other changes, there are issues around defined benefit schemes and the fact that companies continue to move towards defined contribution schemes.  Any protections for defined benefit schemes should be introduced along with anything to prevent companies from moving to the lesser defined contribution option.
