","asker":"1090","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated by the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, where the total number of contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the person&rsquo;s insurance record.  The maximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a yearly average of at least 48, and there are banded entitlements below that.<\/p>  <p>  In calculating the yearly average, the number of full-rate contributions paid and\/or credited are counted up to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the number of years in their record up to that point.  For example, if someone&rsquo;s record was from 1971, and they turned 66 on 1 July 2015, it would be the contributions they paid or were credited in the period to 31 December 2014, divided by 44 years (i.e. every year from 1971 to 2014).  Taking the subsequent period into account to calculate the yearly average could only increase their contributions by a maximum of 26 contributions, and if their yearly average was already higher than that, this would have the effect of reducing their yearly average, rather than increase it, as the amended total would be divided by 45.  Given the fact that in most cases, this would result in a lower rather than a higher yearly average, it is to most people&rsquo;s advantage that the rule should apply as it does now.  However, the contributions can still be used to satisfy other contribution conditions (notably the 'contributions paid' rule in State pension contributory).  <\/p>  <p>  It should be remembered that PRSI does not just fund the State pension contributory and enable people to qualify for that payment, but also working age benefits before they retire.  The PRSI system does not make refunds in respect of contributions which do not end up being used to qualify for various payments.  To do so would reduce the sustainability of the PRSI system, and require an increase in the rate of contributions, and\/or a reduction in the level of payments it funds.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.

The purpose of the Act is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  The Act\u00a0requires entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. <\/p>  <p>  All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions are covered by this Act.  Borrowers are\u00a0therefore restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman also have this right restored by this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is currently undertaking a consultation process on the\u00a0Authorisation Requirements and Standards for Credit Servicing Firms and Consequential Amendments to its\u00a0Codes which closes on 30th September.  Included in its proposals are provisions which will ensure that a regulated lender who sells loans subject to the 2012 Consumer Protection\u00a0Code to an unregulated transferee must, ahead of that sale, identify the firm who will provide the regulated activity of credit servicing for those loans post the sale and provide the requisite notification of their details to the Central Bank and the customer in accordance with Provision 3.11 of the Code. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract.

The primary role of the Naval Service Diving Section is to support Naval and other Defence Forces operations.  However, the Naval Service makes every effort to deploy to assist in maritime search operations following a request from the IRCG or from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  On the afternoon of Tuesday, 15 September last the Naval Service received an Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for assistance in the search for the missing person in question.  The Naval Service was unable to respond immediately due to the unavailability of divers at the time of the request.  However, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was advised that the Naval Service would keep the matter under review and on the morning of Thursday, 17 September, a diving team was dispatched to the area.  The team has supported the search since then until it was stood down yesterday when it was determined in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Coast Guard and in light of the weather conditions, that divers could no longer provide a meaningful contribution to the search. However, the matter is being kept under review.   <\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service has undertaken 118 days on fishery patrols off the North Mayo coast up to 21 September 2015. It undertook 64 operational days associated with the Corrib Gas Field in the 10 years from 2005 to 2015.  However, the vast majority of these operations were in the earlier part of this period.   <\/p>  <p>  During the period 12 to 18 September 2015 three vessels were deployed while a fourth was deployed from 14 September 2015.  The ships were deployed on fishery patrols, Aid to the Civil Power and on an overseas mission.  Decisions in relation to the deployment of Naval vessels are made on an ongoing basis by Naval Operations Command, in consultation with Operations and Plans Branch in Defence Forces Headquarters, having regard to, inter alia, the security environment, resource availability, patrol plans, weather conditions and any requirements arising from the various roles assigned to the Defence Forces.   <\/p>  <p>  While there are 46 qualified divers in the Naval Service, 10 are dedicated to the Naval Service Diving Section.  The remaining 36 divers fill various regular (non-diving) appointments in the Naval Service.  These personnel are not available on a dedicated &lsquo;call-out&rsquo; basis.  It may also be noted, that for a variety of reasons, 11 of the 46 personnel are not currently available to participate in diving operations.  These reasons include divers undertaking training courses abroad, those deployed in military roles outside of the Naval Service and persons currently unfit for diving duties.  The NSDS can deploy to a dive site on a Naval vessel, or, as was the case in this instance, by road.  The time to travel to a dive site is dependent on a number of variables.  When deployed in an Aid to the Civil Power capacity, naval divers remain under the operational control of the lead Naval Service officer but maintain close liaison with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Coast Guard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300078#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300079#WRM00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300079#WRM00300"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[32337\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300079#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if permission can be facilitated to remain in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person mentioned by the Deputy is present in the State on foot of a Working Holiday Authorisation which expired on 31 August 2015: this person should have left the State following the expiration of this permission. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that a comprehensive letter issued to this person on 19 August 2015 which mentioned the immigration options which are available to enable this person to remain legally in the State.

It is expected that these numbers will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The first arrivals under the Programme are expected by year end.  The number of persons in need of international protection will be kept under review;<\/p>  <p> - establishing a new cross-departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.

The Hague Convention is a landmark in regard to inter-country adoption and provides an international architecture that prioritises the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  While it has signed the Convention, the Russian Federation has not ratified the treaty. This has prevented recent adoptions from Russia into Ireland. Over the last number of years efforts have been ongoing to try and reach a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation on inter-country adoption. <\/p>  <p>  Since  its establishment, my department has carried forward this work but significant issues remain in the way of an agreement. For example the Irish Constitution is very clear on the integrity of the family unit here and Russian requirements for post placement reports on adopted children pose a difficulty in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  My department has been working with the Irish Embassy in Moscow in seeking progress towards a bilateral.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2013 officials from the Russian Federation travelled to Ireland for a meeting. Officials from my department had considered going to Russia earlier this year., however this meeting was deferred. The Irish Embassy in Moscow has been assisting in liaising with the Ministry of Education and Science, which is the responsible department in Russia. <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with the Russian Irish Adoption Group to advise them on the current situation. Members of the group have adopted Russian children in the past, prior to the current arrangements, and many seek to adopt a sibling also from Russia. At the meeting I was deeply conscious of this reality and members of the RIAG gave a powerful presentation of the sensitivities involved.  <\/p>  <p>  I and my department take the view that it is essential to give clear, frank information about the likely time scale potentially involved in trying to secure an agreement with the Russian Federation. Families must have an accurate assessment of the time scales involved in order to allow fully informed decision making. I advised the RIAG representatives that  in practical terms, even  in the event of bilateral being finalised ,   it could take a further couple of years before adoptions with Russia could take place.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in an extensive work programme across a wide range of issues with a clear central theme; to work in the very best interests of children and young people, protecting and enhancing their lives. The issue of the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Russia must be considered in the context of the overall priorities of the Department in relation to adoption and the general focus of Ireland in regard to countries of origin for Inter Country Adoption. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the bilateral has not ceased and it remains the aim of the Department to finalise a bi-lateral agreement on inter-country adoption with the Russian Federation.

International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.<\/p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.<\/p><p>Up to the 15 July 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>2).  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events\/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.<\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to evaluate data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.

With this in mind and in order to avoid a situation where a person's application would fail on death, the Government decided to include Section 9 in the Redress Act.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital.  Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.    <\/p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.  My Department keeps the operation of the ban under regular review   . <\/p>  <p>   Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective.  The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.     <\/p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis.  The study includes- <\/p>  <p>  - an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and<\/p>  <p>  - an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels.   <\/p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year.  However, it should also be noted that I plan to engage in further consultation on the matter of clean air in the coming months, commencing with a 'Clean Air Conference' hosted by my Department and the EPA in Dublin on 28 September, which will examine and discuss current and future challenges for clean air policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300087#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300087#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[32339\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300087#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has reduced funding to the Environmental Protection Agency since 2007; if so, if he will provide an annual breakdown of the reduced funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>The financial allocations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), comprising funding from both the Exchequer and the Environment Fund, for the years specified is set out in the table below.

In this context,\u00a0\u00a0my Department published a comprehensive Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport in August\u00a02015 which set out the priorities and key principles for investing in our transport network. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01050"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[32468\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the basis for his reporting of the number of US troops passing through Shannon Airport; and the way he arrived at the number of 55,405 for 2014.","asker":"1192","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>\u200bAs stated in the response to Parliamentary Question Ref No.617 of 20th January 2015 the figure 55,405 was based on information provided by Shannon Airport Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Navigation Orders","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01250"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[32469\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092300091#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will indicate the advance notice required for permit requests for the carriage of munitions under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973; and the procedure followed when considering those requests.","asker":"1192","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>Applications from airlines for munitions of war exemptions under Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order are received by my Department on\u00a0a standard application form.    \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department requests that such applications are made at least 48 hours before the flight is due to take place.
