In accordance with procedure, the draft general scheme has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website and forwarded to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Following the conclusion of this phase of the legislative procedure, the general scheme will be sent to the Office of the Attorney General for the drafting of a Bill.  Consideration of the final drafting will be informed by the deliberations of this committee during the pre-legislative phase.<\/p><p>  The Irish horseracing industry makes a significant contribution to employment and the Irish economy generally.  It is estimated to underpin 14,000 jobs, &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and exports to the value of &euro;205 million to 37 countries worldwide in 2013.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is charged with the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  The 2001 Act sets down the mechanism under which State support is provided to HRI.  HRI provides funding for integrity services to the Racing Regulatory Body, RRB.  The Turf Club, including the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, a private body, is designated as the RRB and is charged with carrying out these functions under the current legislation.  HRI has provided between &euro;5.5 million and &euro;7 million per annum to the Turf Club in respect of integrity services over the past five years.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out an independent review of certain aspects of the horse racing industry.  The Department facilitated a stakeholder consultation process as part of the review.  Written submissions were sought from interested parties and forwarded to Indecon for their consideration.  The resultant report examined the legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the industry, including the streamlining of functions assigned by legislation to HRI and the RRB, and made a number of recommendations in this regard.<\/p><p>  The report contained recommendations aimed at providing a more viable and sustainable horse racing sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, announced his acceptance of the Indecon recommendations and his intention to introduce amending legislation to facilitate the introduction of the changes recommended by Indecon.  Arising from the Indecon report, HRI and the RRB established a streamlining task force with a view to achieving efficiencies and to achieve a minimum of 10% reduction in costs, as identified in the report.  Consultants Smith &amp;amp; Williamson were appointed by the task force to act as facilitator in these discussions.  Smith &amp;amp; Williamson prepared a report that contained 18 recommendations, which it estimated would give rise to &euro;1.8 million per annum in savings. <\/p><p>  In preparing the draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine engaged in discussions with HRI and the RRB about the recommendations in the Indecon and Smith &amp;amp; Williamson reports over a considerable period of time.  The draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 was circulated to a number of Departments and to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for observations.  A number of observations were received and these were accommodated in so far as possible in the draft general scheme forwarded to this committee for legislative scrutiny.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine obtained Cabinet approval on 3 June for the draft general scheme and to proceed to the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  The draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 builds on recommendations of the Indecon report and is intended to strengthen governance and transparency within the administration of horse racing, to clarify the respective roles of HRI and the RRB, to improve accountability and control over State funding and to streamline the administrative functions of the two bodies.<\/p><p>  In regard to governance, it is proposed to reduce the size and alter the structure of the HRI board in order to improve efficiency and accountability and increase ministerial representation on the board, in accordance with the Indecon recommendations.  The functions of the RRB will be maintained and strengthened and, in particular, the draft general scheme includes an enabling provision permitting the Minister to authorise RRB personnel to carry out functions under the Animal Remedies Act 1993.<\/p><p>  The general scheme provides for a single streamlined administrative structure within HRI for registration, financial and other functions of HRI and the RRB without compromising the integrity functions of the RRB or their property rights to income derived from the registration of hunters&rsquo; certificates for point to point racing and the licensing of participants in racing.  In this context, I should make it clear that there will be no change in so far as the organisation of point to points is concerned.  The organisation of meetings, the issuing of hunter certificates, the acceptance of horse racing entries and declarations will continue to be managed by hunt clubs.  However, the registration functions, that is, the registration of hunter certificates and trainers, will reside along with other registration horse racing functions in HRI.<\/p><p>  The scheme provides for enhanced control and accountability with explicit provisions empowering the Minister to issue directives to HRI, requiring HRI to comply with codes of practice and permitting the Minister to withhold funding instalments from HRI and Bord na gCon if he is dissatisfied with their strategic or other plans.  It provides for the accounts of the RRB to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published, and for the CEO of the RRB to attend at Oireachtas committees as required.  Key provisions include changes to the HRI board&rsquo;s size and structure to improve efficiency and accountability.  The board currently comprises 14 members - a chairman and 13 ordinary members.  The Minister nominates only the chairman and one other member of the board, the latter to represent the interests of horse racing in Northern Ireland.  All other members of the board are nominated by representative organisations.  The Indecon report suggested that this has resulted in low levels of Government or ministerial control over the process of decision making by the HRI board.  It is proposed that the number of ordinary board members is reduced from 13 to 12, with an increase in the number of ministerial appointees from one to three.  The representation from the RRB on the board of HRI is reduced from five to three, a proposal with which the RRB has no difficulty. <\/p><p>  HRI currently has 26 board committees, which are important in supporting the main work of the board.  The Indecon report suggested that none of the existing committees focussed adequately on the particular needs of the betting sector or on employee requirements.  Against this background, the general scheme provides for the creation of two new statutory committees to represent those employed in the sector and the betting industry in addition to the two existing committees that deal with the issues of media rights and race fixtures.  The scheme also provides for a standard five person membership of all four statutory sub-committees proposed under this legislation.  They are the race fixtures committee, the industries services committee, the betting committee and the media rights committee.  The scheme also provides for HRI to appoint the chair of the race fixtures committee.<\/p> <p>Under the current legislation, the latter committee is chaired by a racing regulatory body director of Horse Racing Ireland.<br\/>The draft scheme also proposes the retention by the RRB of responsibility for integrity functions and for the licensing of racecourses, jockeys, valets and other participants in racing.  At local level the issuing of hunter certificates, management of horse racing entries and declarations for point-to-point races will remain with the local hunt clubs.  Amendments to the rules of racing will be subject to consultation with HRI in the context of budgetary arrangements.  HRI will not have any <i>imprimatur<\/i>over the rules of racing but it is considered appropriate, for the sake of good order, to have some level of consultation where rules which could have an impact on budgetary requirements are to be changed.  The Bill also includes an enabling provision permitting the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to appoint persons or classes of persons to carry out all or any of the functions of authorised officers under the Animal Remedies Act 1993, subject to such conditions as the Minister deems appropriate.  This provision was included at the request of the racing regulatory body.<br\/>The general scheme also provides for greater clarity on the functions of HRI, including the power to issue directives setting rules and procedures relating to its functions.  There is a lack of clarity in the current legislation regarding responsibility for the administration and financial management of the Irish horse racing industry.  The scheme provides for a single streamlined administrative structure within HRI for registration, licensing, financial and other functions of HRI and the RRB without compromising the integrity functions of the RRB.  This will require data sharing between HRI and RRB.  This streamlining measure includes the processing, but not ownership, of income from the licensing functions and registration fees for hunter certificates and trainers from point-to-points which are currently administered by the racing regulatory body.  This will eliminate any need for duplication between HRI and the RRB, particularly in regard to certain administration aspects such as the registration of hunter certificates and the registration of point-to-point trainers or handlers.  It will also pave the way for increased efficiency in the administration of areas such as finance, information technology, payroll and pensions.  In the case of point-to-point meetings, however, fees for issuing hunter certificates, fixtures and entries will remain with the local hunt clubs, as will responsibility for arranging such meetings.<br\/>The scheme provides for improved ministerial control with explicit provisions empowering the Minister to issue directions to HRI and requiring HRI to furnish information on the scope of its activities, including compliance with codes of practice or other Government policy documents, to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine when requested.  There is no explicit obligation in current legislation requiring HRI to comply with the requirements of the code of practice or for the RRB to report to HRI and this deficiency is being addressed.<br\/>There are insufficient provisions in the current legislation, in respect of the procedure for making payments to HRI and to Bord na gCon, to allow the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to withhold financial support if he is dissatisfied with the strategic and other plans submitted to support any funding proposals or their implementation.  It is proposed to provide explicit permission for the Minister to withhold funding instalments from HRI or Bord na gCon if he is dissatisfied with the strategic and other plans submitted.  Funding may also be withheld where HRI or Bord na gCon have failed to provide information requested by the Minister or where they have failed to comply with a direction of the Minister.  Similarly, the racing regulatory body shall be required to furnish information to HRI on its activities when requested to do so.  This information may be taken into account by HRI in determining the annual budgetary requirements of the RRB.<br\/>The accounts of the RRB will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published.  The chief executive of the RRB will be obliged to attend Oireachtas committees as required.  There is also a provision permitting the Minister to require HRI and the RRB to agree procedures to ensure compliance with Government codes of practice, guidelines or policy documents as well as in respect of the provision of financial and other information on any matter funded by HRI.  The scheme empowers HRI to make various deductions from prize money in accordance with HRI directives.  This is essentially a reflection of current practice.  However, HRI cannot make changes in the directives governing deductions for charitable funds administered by the RRB without the prior agreement of the racing regulatory body.  This is because under current practice the RRB funds four charities from these deductions and it is only reasonable that it should agree to any change to those arrangements.<br\/>My colleagues and I would be happy to discuss the heads in the general scheme in detail and answer any questions the members of the committee may have.  Alternatively, we would be happy to go through the general scheme, head by head, as suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070100003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404220200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Gleeson.

Again, what is contained here is a reflection of the recommendations in the Indecon report.  In section 4(2), the number of ordinary members of the board is reduced from 13 to 12.  That is a reflection of a view expressed by Indecon that the board was probably too big.  Indeed, it cited OECD and other studies which suggested that smaller boards function more effectively.  It is not much of a reduction, but there is also an increase in the representation of the Minister from one to three.  That requires, in turn, a reduction in the number of nominees of the racing regulatory body from five to three.  In another provision here, the reference to the Minister for Finance is changed in section 4(6)(1) to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is an explicit requirement in section 4(6)(2) that the HRI shall have regard to Government policy, the code of practice for the governance of State agencies and other public pay policy in determining the remuneration of the chairman and the board members.<\/p><p>  It is arguable that these provisions were already applicable, but there was no explicit requirement in the legislation.

Indecon and Smith and Williamson both made recommendations on the streamlining of certain administrative functions.  Two offices located within one mile of each other are performing similar functions and this gives rise to a cost for the industry and those who participate in it.  The proposed new section 10(1)(a) to be inserted into the 1994 Act is simply an overarching statement of the functions of Horse Racing Ireland and quite straightforward.<\/p><p>  The proposed new section 10(1)(b) is slightly more complex and makes provision for something new, namely, that the registration of both hunter certificates and participants in point to point steeplechases will be carried out by Horse Racing Ireland.  These functions are currently carried out by the racing regulatory body.  The reason we are proposing to transfer them to Horse Racing Ireland is it already carries out such registration functions in respect of horse racing.  In short, it has the administrative structures in place to allow it to do this.  It would be sensible to consolidate these registration functions in a single body.  However, we are very conscious of the need to ensure local interest in point to point racing will not be diminished in any way and that what is proposed will not undermine the voluntary effort which makes point to point meetings possible.  The issuing of hunter certificates, the acceptance of horse racing entries and declarations for point to point steeplechases have always been carried out by local hunt clubs.  Under the provisions that have been drawn up, that will continue to be the case.  There will be no change in the organisation of point to point racing.  However, the registration functions will be carried out by Horse Racing Ireland.<\/p><p>  The proposed new section 10(1)(b)(ii) refers to the processing of all charges and payments to participants in the horse racing industry, including charges relating to licensing, with the exception of the issuing of hunter certificates, the acceptance of horse racing entries and declarations for point to point steeplechases.  We are creating a statutory basis to allow Horse Racing Ireland to carry out the processing of payments relating to the horse racing sector.  This includes some functions currently performed by the racing regulatory body.  We will deal with this matter later in our discussion on the general scheme but, essentially, it will involve payments being made to and processed by Horse Racing Ireland.  Where such payments relate to functions carried out by the Turf Club, the money will have to be returned to the latter in order to protect its property rights.  There is a potential issue in the context of prejudicing the property rights of the racing regulatory body, but we have explicitly provided - at a later point in the general scheme and on the advice of the Attorney General - for these funds to be given back to the Turf Club.  This provision relates to administrative streamlining, simplicity and trying to reduce the cost burden on the industry and is sensible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070100006#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1404221400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>We stated we would discuss betting.

First, if the funding derives from integrity activities carried out by the racing regulatory body, the funds will be handed back.  Second, in the context of the legislation, as drafted, there is a guarantee that funding will be provided for horse racing and integrity functions.  Within the overall context it seems entirely reasonable that when determining what funding is required for integrity services, as it is taxpayers' money that is involved, HRI be able to take into account all sources of funding for the racing regulatory body.  In other words, if it receives funding through integrity functions, in determining how much taxpayers money should go in on top of it, it has to have regard to the funding received from these other sources.  In practice, how I see the system operating is that the racing regulatory body will make a demand of Horse Racing Ireland.  It will present a budget that will explain the various sources of funding and the demands on that funding and then request funding from HRI in order to carry out its functions.<\/p><p>  There is also a provision in existing legislation - it is an unusual one, but it is in recognition of the importance of the integrity functions - which allows for an arbitrator to make a determination in the event of a dispute between the racing regulatory body and HRI.

It will also be very important to the racing regulatory body that its integrity function is independent.  <br\/>We included the phrase &quot;following consultation with HRI&quot;.  That does not suggest HRI has an <br\/><i>imprimatur <\/i>over the modification of the rules of racing.  However, it is sensible that when making rules that may impact on the cost associated with the administration of racing, or the cost to any of the participants in racing, that one would at least consult the HRI.  The term used is &quot;consultation&quot; which means it does not require agreement.  <br\/>Head 11(1)(c) refers to licensing racecourses which is the function of the Turf Club.  The highlighted section states &quot;subject to the licence fees being paid by the applicants to HRI.&quot;  The provision streamlines the administrative function.  As I mentioned earlier, and I shall reach it shortly, in order to avoid any undue interference with property rights the advice from the Office of the Attorney General was that if we streamline the function in this way the fees would have to be repaid to the Turf Club in order to avoid any interference with property rights.  That would have to be done. <br\/>Head 11(1)(d) states:<blockquote>to set charges for licences, registration of hunter certificates and participants in point to point steeplechases subject to consultation with HRI and having regard to the annual budget agreed under section<i><\/i>42.<\/blockquote>The new phrase in the provision is &quot;subject to consultation&quot;.  The provision does not suggest that HRI has an <i>imprimatur <\/i>over the fees to be charged but it must be consulted.  <br\/>Head 11(1)(g) refers to codes of practice and assurance schemes for matters within its functions.  These are additional functions which reflects current good practice and they give the Turf Club a little bit more flexibility in terms of how it chooses to apply its integrity function.<br\/>Head 11(1)(h) states &quot;to ensure that the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Regulations for Point-to-Point Steeplechase .... are enforced.&quot;  In other words, this is a direct consequence of the earlier wording which indicates that the rules of racing apply to point to points and, <i>de facto<\/i>, reflects the current reality.<br\/>I now refer the committee to the highlighted section on page 23.  The provision reflects the advice we received from the Office of the Attorney General on the protection of the property rights of the racing regulatory body.  To be clear, we want to streamline the administrative functions but we do not want to unduly interfere with anybody's property rights.  I mean to the extent that HRI will be processing payments which relate to functions of the racing regulatory body, then it will have to give that money back to the racing regulatory body.  That includes &quot;its registration of hunter certificates or registration of participants in point to point steeplechases&quot;, which refers to its registration functions only, and &quot;fines under the Rules of Racing.&quot;  The provision is based on clear advice received from the Office of the Attorney General.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070100009#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1404223800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Is the collection of fines part of the streamlining of administration and is it directly referenced earlier?

This head is as a result of a request from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Essentially it is a provision that requires the racing regulatory body, which receives, if one excludes the Curragh and the Gallops from its finances, about 80% of the remainder of its income from the Exchequer through HRI.<br\/>This provision requires the racing regulatory body to keep accounts, which it does of course, and to publish them.  It requires the body to be amenable to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which it is not at present.  It requires the chief executive to be amenable to committees of the Oireachtas, where he is required to do so.  <br\/>This is a question of good practice.  I do not believe that the racing regulatory body or anybody associated with it will have any difficulty whatsoever with this provision.  I think the body is quite happy to open its books and be amenable to the Oireachtas.<br\/>There is an item that deserves specific mention under head 12(5).  We have already spoken about the Minister's power to obtain information and give a direction to HRI.  This is part of that cascade of accountability.  Head 12 (5) states: <blockquote>Subject to <i>subsection (6),<\/i>the Racing Regulatory Body shall whenever requested by HRI, furnish information in relation to its functions under <i>section 39<\/i>(including such information in relation to its income derived from its statutory functions in order to assist HRI in determining annual budget requirements) as is specified in the request.<\/blockquote>It is the normal cascade of accountability.  If the Exchequer is giving the racing regulatory body funding for its integrity functions, it is only reasonable that one should know how it is going to be spent and its budgetary situation.  In recognition of the particular importance of an independent integrity function, we have tagged on subsection (6) which suggests that a request by HRI under that section shall not compromise the racing regulatory body's provision of integrity services.  It states, &quot;(6) A request by HRI under <i>subsection (5<\/i>) shall not compromise the Racing Regulatory Body&rsquo;s provision of integrity services.&quot;  That is built in.  I wish to make the point about the representative nature of the HRI board and the fact that it does have three Turf Club people on it and increased ministerial representations.  The process is reasonably robust and protects the taxpayer in a more explicit way and also protects the integrity function of the racing regulatory body which is critically important for the functioning of the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070100010#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1404223800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>That ties in with what I was asking earlier.

For example, this would allow the Minister decide that for the purposes of horse racing, a particular species, a particular set of locations - trainers' yards, race tracks - racing regulatory body officials could have the powers of authorised officers because when it comes to serious investigations or prosecutions the tendency is to engage with the Department's special investigations unit, which has the full powers of authorised officers.  We would always envisage that in circumstances such as those there would be close co-operation between the Department and the turf club.

ISME welcomes the opportunity to discuss the problems in town and village centres and the ways in which we can rectify them.  As we all know, the sad reality is that town centres that were once the vibrant hearts of their communities, serviced by many small and medium businesses, are under threat.  The difficulties being experienced on the main streets and in town centres are well documented.  I will talk about a number of issues, many of which are relevant to small businesses, be they in a town centre or an out-of-town centre.  There are high commercial rents, a decrease in domestic demand, an increase in the popularity of Internet shopping and local authority rates and charges, not to mention the black economy which is booming in Ireland.  In addition, there are parking problems in town centres.  There has been a massively accelerated rate of shopping centre development, with an accompanying surge in the availability of new retail space.  This has irreversibly changed the face of town centre retailing.<br\/>The ability to build stores outside towns has been made possible by a combination of confused and poorly applied planning rules, the power of big developers and the weakness of local councils and councillors who were bamboozled by developers.  The retail planning guidelines, as they apply, represent best international practice and were intended to direct policy-makers in the assessment of planning applications in the context of devising retail policies and strategies.  One of the key issues arising was their inconsistent interpretation by decision-makers.  That occurred owing to a combination of vagueness within the guidelines and a lack of understanding by practitioners.  As a result, the short-sighted decisions made allowed far too many out-of-town centres to be opened, tearing the heart out of local communities.  At the end of 1999, before what we call the Celtic tiger, although it was more or less the end of the real Celtic tiger, there was about 500,000 sq. ft. of shopping space in Ireland.  By the end of 2007, there was 3.3 million sq. m of non-high street floor space.  Therefore, there had been a massive increase.  Suffice it to say Ireland ranked second in shopping space <i>per capita<\/i>.  It was surpassed only by the Netherlands.<br\/>As we know, there was always competition in town centres, which helped the community.  The old system was a much fairer one, both for the town and the community, because there was variety, quality and choice, while people shopped around.  Now, owing to a lack of foresight on the part of councils and an eagerness to grab the shilling, as we would say, we have managed to decimate our towns.  Local neighbourhood centres, where all services could be availed of, are closing down.  We have sacrificed communities in favour of perceived convenience.  Not only did we do this but the previous Administration tampered with the cap on retail warehousing to facilitate one multinational retailer.  That has probably opened the door, even though there were promises of 500 jobs in Ballymun.  I would like to know exactly how many quality jobs were created there.  How many quality jobs have we actually lost in the furniture sector across the country because of what occurred?  The trade-off was not in our best interests as a country.  However, it has been done.  ISME is stating politicians' fingerprints are all over this and it is now incumbent on them to sort it out, or at least to help to do so.<br\/>The reduction in footfall, stemming largely from decreased consumer spending, has contributed to the ghost town effect.  The decay of town centres did not happen overnight.  A speedy resolution, while preferable, will not be possible.  We need a comprehensive strategy for renewing main streets and town centres and it must be agreed to and implemented as quickly as possible if streets which were once the focal points of community life are to be maintained.  There is a definite correlation between a proactive and supportive local authority and a strong business revival in village and town centres.  Businesses can be encouraged to remain in or move to towns through a range of schemes and incentives.  The long-term outcome would be a vibrant town and increased revenue all around.<br\/>One issue that arises is that of parking, about which we keep hearing.  City and county councils must assist their rate-paying business customers by offering parking incentives to consumers.  Councils have a responsibility to consult relevant stakeholders to decide on a package of parking incentives that would best suit their town centres.  This seems to be a big issue that keeps coming up.<br\/>While many say the aforementioned is not the be all and end all, we now see that when the municipal district reduces its parking income, the total amount of the general municipal allocation, GMA, will also be reduced.  In other words, existing guidance incentivises municipalities to increase rather than decrease parking charges.  If municipal income is increased, the general municipal allocation increases and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  That issue needs to be examined.<br\/>With regard to streetscapes and the attractiveness of towns, a number of issues arise.  First, we certainly need to incentivise a scheme to occupy vacant properties along the lines of what has been done in the Limerick area where there has been grant relief based on certified fit-out costs, up to a maximum of 50% of the annual rates in year one and 25% in year two.  That would certainly help.  We need to impose disincentives on landlords to prevent them from leaving units vacant.  We also need to bring into place the concept of town teams, about which members will have heard time and again.  The teams work towards improving the prosperity of town centres and creating a viable and sustainable town centre economy.  Town teams in Ballinrobe and Claremorris operate according to a vision and purpose to improve their towns' prosperity and they work by consensus.  A team consists of private and public sector representatives, creating an operational plan in seeking partnerships in an annual work plan to rejuvenate the town.<br\/>Regular community events such as village or town fairs and festivals do much to encourage footfall.  If one goes to an out-of-town shopping centre, one will find that somebody is in charge of entertainment and ensuring there is more to shopping then just purchasing.  In other words, shopping becomes an experience.  We need to bring this thinking to town centres again.  Most towns could have a proactive way of organising such events.  We have seen an increase in the number of such events in recent years, but much more work needs to be done.<br\/>We have seen a lot of work being done in the United Kingdom.  There is no harm in considering the incentives being examined there, including the review of double yellow lines, legislating to allow grace periods and ensuring CCTV is not used just to detect parking violations.<\/p> <p>Much of that work has been started over there.  It is good to track and analyse those measures to be in a position to adapt them and to permit the mistakes and successes to influence any initiatives adopted for town centres in Ireland.<\/p><p> Crime is a priority for local Garda stations and it is addressed by way of ASBOs etc.  It is important to increase the use of CCTV in town centres to ensure the streets both are and are perceived to be safe.  It is an important aspect of the initiatives.  More broadly, we are looking at local authority charges and rates, upwards-only rent reviews, increases in PRSI this year and the threat, which is becoming more of an issue, involving the sale of cigarettes.  All of these issues are having a negative effect on retail.  ISME has proposed a rates freeze for existing businesses for the short to medium term to allow owner-managers facing economic and costs uncertainties to at least have some certainty in this regard.  The simple act of guaranteeing rates for a specified time would help to instil confidence and make it easier to predict future costs.  That would facilitate growth in business and job creation opportunities.  Charges for simple requests, such as a licence for outdoor chairs and tables, must also be reduced or eliminated where possible.  Local authorities must work with owner-managers in businesses who are attempting to improve town centre trading rather than viewing them solely as an opportunity to boost town coffers.<\/p><p> Upwards-only rent reviews require attention, obviously.  Senator Quinn's Bill has gone through the Seanad.  We hope the Whips will not be brought out on that one and that it will get a proper hearing in the D&aacute;il at least.  It should be passed so that if the President decides to refer it to the Supreme Court, that can be done.  That would get rid of the anomaly whereby we had pre-election promises which were broken afterwards based on certain advices.  The advice that was given before seemed to change.  It is incumbent on us to look at the number of retailers who are in trouble based on upwards-only rent reviews.<\/p><p> The increase in employer PRSI for low-paid workers is an issue.  In the retail trade, many employees are working shorter hours to suit themselves.  The previous PRSI rate of 4.25% was increased to 8.5%, a 100% increase that has had a major effect on retailers in particular.  Not only has it threatened recruitment, it has threatened existing jobs in retail.  In addition to the PRSI increase, we now have a new fee for retailers who are selling cigarettes, which we regard as the imposition of a punishment tax on retailers and the placing of an additional burden on businesses which are already struggling.  We hope the Minister for Health will see that and reduce it accordingly to something that is more manageable.<\/p><p> Overall, retailers are being hit by a rapid increase in online retailing.  Whether one is a town-centre or out-of-town business, it is the same thing.  Retailing has evolved to a point at which people are expecting to view products online prior to visiting a store.  Consumers also expect that they can order online and collect in-store or else have goods delivered to them.  The stores that will survive in the coming years are the ones that adapt to the evolving world of retail.  We see Government making some efforts in that regard with the online trading vouchers which were launched as part of the national digital strategy.  That has the potential to get more businesses trading online, but there have been low numbers and a slow roll-out.  They were promised and promised again last year, but we now see them starting to come out.  We hope the scheme will start the ball rolling and become effective, as online trading has become a fact of life, and this will affect retailers who do not embrace it.<\/p><p> Shopping local is an area in which, now more than ever, we need a national effort to save and retain Irish jobs.  Buying from locally-owned businesses keeps money in circulation closer to where it is spent.  Local shops use local services, including local accountants, local insurance brokers and PR companies, as well as employing local people.  They also carry a higher percentage of locally made goods.  From our own and international research, we see that for every &euro;10 spent locally on Irish products, the multiplier effect is of the order of approximately &euro;24 for the local community.  To look at it in a different way, of every &euro;1 spent with local shops, 45 cent is invested locally, whereas the equivalent figure for foreign multiples is approximately 15 cent.  There is a three-fold increase in local investment when one trades with local suppliers.  A greater effort to purchase locally is required.<\/p><p> On a more positive note, our research indicates that the majority of retailers in our organisation are optimistic and resilient.  They are intent on expanding.  They are carrying out reviews of their businesses from finance to service delivery and staff training to premises and equipment investment in anticipation of any increase in consumer spending.  As retailing is intensely competitive and dependent on consumer preferences, quality, value for money and customer service, it is paramount that businesses create a shopping experience.  To invest and revamp, one needs finance.  After the recent banking fiasco which led to the bailout and created major problems, a little over 60% of our retail members have found it almost impossible to get bank financing, whether for new or renegotiated facilities.  The hard fact is that many retailers have had to fund any investment through their internal self-finance resources, if such are available.  Another recent challenge has been the massive increase in money handling and transmission fees and charges foisted on retailers by bailed-out banks in an attempt to get back their super-profits.  It is an area we must keep an eye on.<\/p><p> Despite the disastrous recession, however, retailers are preparing for the positive.  They can see the return of more people to work and they will ensure by prudent management of their own resources a near-term return to sustainable job creation.  We have seen evidence of that in our most recent trends survey, the results of which have not yet been published.  We see retailers starting to come out of the recession, although they are behind the main economy.  There are positive trends in employment in particular.  The whole essence of dynamic retailing is to be innovative and competitive.  Innovation is not just a matter of building large shopping centres or enormous stores to the maximum extent possible; it is about providing new formats, suitable to local conditions and accessible to a wider number of consumers in the largest number of locations with the minimum additional impact on congestion.<\/p><p> What we are talking about, of course, is town centres.  It is too easy to seek one solution to solve all problems, but we have by our actions over the last half century neglected our town centres.  The way we live has changed and will change further.  If town centres are our lifeblood and if they are to be a point of difference, we must support and guide them and encourage radical thinking and action over a sustained period.<\/p> <p>We do not need nor will we again have the town centres of the 1950s and 1960s, but we need an energetic and effective town centre in the Ireland of the 21st century.  We in ISME believe that by implementing the recommendations seen by the committee, the vitality of town and village centres can be restored, which would inevitably lead to the creation of jobs and the greater enhancement of community life for local people and tourists.  Examining rates and charges and the way in which the money is spent, introducing town teams, providing for a mix of businesses and services and exploring ways of exploiting the opportunities available online will work to restore town centres to being the heart of community life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404226200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Mr. Fielding spoke very clearly and in a frank manner.

We know about the problems as we have heard about them before.  It is interesting to hear his expression of confidence and belief that it is possible to get somewhere.  Having confidence is so important.  I have said before that there is far too much acceptance of the belief the Government, the council and somebody else should be doing something.  I was in a partnership many years ago before I entered the House.  I remember going to a meeting aimed at creating jobs and being stunned by the fact that practically everybody at the meeting said they had to get the Government to help, to get a State agency to help them, instead of doing it themselves, yet I see towns around the country in which individuals are actually working together.  I was involved in a number of towns in recent years in which people did not even work together.  However, when one got them to work together, one found that they could have a vibrant town that was exciting and could attract customers.  I remember visiting one town in which people complained that they could not have the footpaths cleaned.  They agreed to do it themselves.  Perhaps they did not do it everyday, but they certainly did it on the days when the council was not doing a good job.  A very large amount is in the hands of retailers themselves.  That is why I particularly liked Mr. Fielding's remark about confidence growing.  Traders on a street should be able to say they will not allow a shop to sit empty and say its use should be given to the local school or art club in order that, in effect, anybody walking down the street will not see empty shops.  They will see shops that are vibrant and alive and that look as though they are doing something.<\/p><p>  I have one other problem having regard to all of the solutions to the problem of parking.  I have experienced this during the years.  Whenever one does not charge for parking or whenever one makes it very easy to do so, owners and staff fill all of the places available.  They arrive in the morning and leave their cars there all day.  We did not find an easy solution to this problem and the answer probably lies in our own hands, by which I mean ISME's members and retailers around the country.  Rather than say the Government should be doing this or that, a huge amount is in the hands of retailers.  If they can do it themselves, they will achieve something.  This applies to Internet shopping, in particular.  Companies around the world and in Ireland are doing an amazing job.  They are able to attract attention, but it does not happen by accident.  It means somebody getting up in the morning and saying he or she is going to make sure it works.  I believe ISME's membership includes a very large number of people who feel that way and will do it, but we must give them the support, openings and confidence they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100005#E00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404226200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Senator Feargal Quinn said.

On the introduction of the concept of town teams, again, we must do it ourselves, although I take the Senator's point that there must be support available.  It is all very well, however, for five or six retailers to say, \"Look at that ugly shop that has been closed; let us do something with it,\" as one comes across difficulties in getting anywhere because there is a landlord who is just sitting on his or her hands.  There is a need for support in that regard.  <\/p><p>  I also take Senator Feargal Quinn's point about the Internet.

We have discussed some of these issues previously with retailers and the same points keep coming up.  I suppose this is because they are not being resolved, which is a problem.  Mr. Fielding was not very complimentary in his remarks about councillors, perhaps with good reason.  Under the new regime in local authorities, councillors will have a greater role in respect of local enterprise offices.  In terms of economic development, does Mr. Fielding think their role, regardless of whether it comes from themselves or is forced on them by management, will involve taking these issues more seriously?  Is he confident that that will?<\/p><p>  At some of the first meetings of county councils there have been proposals to reduce property tax by 15%.  One can look at this in two ways.<\/p> <p>It will either put more money back in people's pockets to spend in retail units or it will make them over reliant on rates from businesses.<\/p><p> Does Mr. Fielding think there is a part to play in getting people into vacant apartments over retail units and old houses in town centres?  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn on the parking issue which is one between the owners of units and workers.<\/p><p>With regard to the so-called Tesco tax, many out-of-town units are leased by independent traders who are entrepreneurs trying to make a go of a business.

I am afraid there will be a hiatus while they bed down in the next while.  I do not know how long it will take them to make the change and bring the enterprise part under county managers who, historically, through no fault of their own, did have not an entrepreneurial bent.  They were much more involved in making sure the facilities and amenities provided were right.  We will wait and see whether they are able to embrace the entrepreneurial side of LEOs.  I just hope that will happen, otherwise we will set back the seedbed of entrepreneurship a few years in Ireland.<\/p><p>  With regard to the ability to reduce property tax by 15%, the Deputy is correct that if councils reduce the tax, they must recoup the money elsewhere and it could be the usual response of hitting business, rather than looking at themselves and seeing where they can reduce their costs, like any business.  If one's income reduces, the first thing one must look at is one's cost base, but we have a history in Ireland of increasing costs when income reduces.  The local authorities study published in July 2010 showed a reduction of between &euro;510 million and &euro;512 million in costs was available to local councillors.  Some of this has been achieved through amalgamations, etc., but they have to look first at their costs before they start looking at businesses to increase rates.<\/p><p>  In the 1950s living over a shop was a way of life and I am sure it could still happen.  Putting incentives in place to bring people back into city and town centres is important.<\/p><p>  I agree on the parking issue.  Staff tend to avail of parking facilities and it is a matter of making sure it does not happen.  The measure would have to be policed properly.<\/p><p>  I do not see a Tesco tax because, as the Deputy said, it would hit other traders.  Everybody has a right to trade wherever he or she is located.  I am talking about what we can do to get people back into the centre of towns because we have lost a lot.  That town culture is part of our Irishness and we are losing it.  Perhaps it might happen anyway.  It was a badge of achievement and honour when one had made enough and was successful enough to move out from over one's shop.  That happened me as a child.  We moved from the road because my father had made a few shillings.  Units do not have to have an owner occupier.  Many of the rooms above shops are vacant and could be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding"},{"type":"speech","time":1404226800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Mr. Fielding mentioned crime and people feeling safe, an issue which has come up in other presentations.

It is not all about retail; it is also about convenience and providing an experience to get people back into town centres.<\/p><p>  While PRSI will not be the only issue, it will certainly be a big one.  Retail members of ISME say it has curtailed not alone their new employees but it has also put a strain on existing employees.<\/p> <p>Rectifying this would create new jobs.  We keep talking about job creation.  The 100% increase in employer PRSI for people earning up to &euro;356 per week has stopped them taking on new employees.  As we know, over recent years, many retailers have had to cut back on staff, but as the consumer is starting to spend, more staff are needed.  Employers look to see how they can do this, and are immediately hit with extra PRSI.  There would be a payback if PRSI were addressed.  The Government could bring the rate back to 4.25%, leave it there, have some sort of sunset clause, and gradually bring it back up again.  The increase was too fast and too much.<\/p><p> The difficulty with online selling is that many retailers and other businesses were sold a pup by slick salespeople who told them getting online was the answer to everything, and there was no such thing as education.  Deputy Calleary referred to this.  Many people took it on board and waited for things to happen, not understanding that one must work one's online presence as one has to work one's shop.  Education and training is part of the answer.<\/p><p> Town teams should be financed in a competitive way so that they compete with each other for funding, bringing the better towns on.

The proposed strategy is a bottom-up, localised development, embracing a public-private partnership model.  The premise is based on identifying local needs and delivering solutions in conjunction with group-based development.  The key deployment is rural, rather than city, locations.  The target audience is the micro sector, both sustaining existing enterprise and creating a supportive environment for start-ups.  NGED offers a simple, transparent management structure and allows for early deployment.  This is about building a local development platform with a strong emphasis on marketing.  Local inputs and modifications can be included to meet specific area requirements.<\/p><p>  The initial development phase will embrace local retail, micro-business and tourism.  The 360 degree development vision is about an integrated development network at local, county and regional level.  In the interim, we propose a first phase that can be deployed and achieved now.  Crucially, given a degree of support, NGED programmes can be rolled out on a pilot basis in a matter of months.  There are positive economic indicators in terms of start-ups.  It is intended that NGED will capitalise on and enhance this trend.  It is hoped that this template deserves positive consideration.<\/p><p>  The retail sector seems to be the current topic of discussion.  Our argument is that we should consider group development - namely, retailers coming together as a group - which will have an impact with regard to what the previous speaker was talking about.  The traditional retail market is dominated to a large extent by the migration to online shopping, the growing position of the multiples, ease of parking, convenience, better ambience, the issue of upward-only rent reviews, and an unsympathetic rates structure.  Our objective is to create a robust and innovative retail environment in town centres, adopt a new shopping experience and image for modern shoppers, identify those critical local development pinch points, and form a dedicated working structure to implement an agreed series of proactive development measures.<\/p><p>  In our template, we propose group-based local structures - that is, groups of local retailers coming together.  Every individual retailer faces exactly the same problem.  Such a collective would provide scale and impact.  As part of the build-up to this, we have recognised that we need to consider a strategy that includes objectives, a structure and generic training.  Because retail, like every other market, has changed, we need to retrain to meet modern demands.  The objectives, primary and secondary and long- and short-term, must be determined by the local business development groups.  We cannot go to a town and impose what we think it needs.  The feedback must come from the ground.  The limited company partnership co-operative must have local agreement.  There is also a case for including a nominal shareholding for external management input.  The strategy will be influenced by the objective needs analysis.  Management will agree a timeline and key objectives, which become part of a business plan and project management.<\/p> <p>Training becomes constant.  <\/p><p> Online e-commerce is a growing opportunity and cannot be ignored.  It is acknowledged that small retail operators may not have the scale or resources to effectively impact on this marketplace.  The shopping proposal is where a group of local retailers consider a group-based communal e-commerce site, share costs and share the benefits not only to drive Internet business but also to drive footfall into the store.  The Americans who tend to be leaders in this space, now see where they are actually killing conventional retailers.  We are trying to focus an online e-commerce site to drive traffic into the stores as well as avail of retail opportunities.  The online aspect should be part of an overall promotional development strategy.  Shopping would be managed externally.  In other words, we have outsourced the shopping programme to a management company.  It is not only about retail sales but to revive town centres as a real shopping destination.  I travel between Tullamore, Portlaoise, Longford, Mullingar, Ballina and Castlebar.  We have good county towns but the retail sector which has gone out of them is effectively dead.  We need to put an emphasis on reviving town centres.<\/p><p> The shopping template becomes the online commercial retail hub where group discounts and offers can be part of the order of the day.  There are opportunities to bring back some additional retail activity.  The introduction of pop-up shops and new variations of hybrid retail units.  Eat 17 is a combination of a food hall, retail sector, music centre and a cafe.  Apparently that concept appeals to the younger shopper.  It has an online promotion which entices them into the shop where they have a burger and it is a place to meet.  That is part of the revival process that we are recommending.  <\/p><p> The pop-up shop will have two variants.  The uShop for single operations and the uShop 2 which is group based and can take on a few variations.  It can be a foodhall type of activity which has a central dining area and there may be ten or 12 smaller units supplying services.  That is the kind of cheap innovation that is needed.  We are not talking about high tech but customer-led projects and marketing, promotion and perception.  They are key to driving this new image.  <\/p><p> Vacant and rundown shops need to be part of the solution as it is disheartening that all one sees on a main street is plywood.  I am aware of local initiatives to paint those vacant shops and, where possible, to display information notices.  This does not involve getting into huge costs but we are improving the image.  Under the local initiative all the shops are painted in nice colours all of which adds to the image.  In embarking on this process we need to get feedback from the retailers and the people on the ground.  We are building a structure that meets the needs.  We could get involved with institutes of technology.  In fact, Athlone and GMIT Castlebar have already helped us.  We can build on the basis of need.<\/p><p> New generation shopping cannot remain in isolation but has got to be part of a wider 360 degree development.  I recall in our town a time where the Connacht final day was bonanza day which was usually on a Sunday.  Some discussion is taking place on whether Connacht final day could be on a Saturday and build a weekend event around it?  All of these things can be done today or tomorrow and one does not have to wait for outside help.  One needs to tie in with local groups with a view to capitalising where possible.  We are not talking about getting involved in major costs.  This is very simple idea.<\/p><p> The operational phase may get technical.  Essentially, it will look to the objectives of these analyses.  This includes a survey and feedback sessions from existing traditional retail sectors.  It is important to have on board.  It is important to have those on board.  The outcome should provide for a needs analysis.  The strategy becomes the means and timeline to achieve the goals and objectives.  The structure on which we are embarking is a commercial structure, not a club structure.  The typical project plan will include the budget, the cost element, the benefits, benchmarks and criteria for measuring it.  It is no good having a plan unless it is measured.  There must be a project breakdown of the structure, the schedule and the risk analysis.  There must be project team roles, reporting processes and financial functions.  The outcome should be clarity of purpose and clarity of vision.  The participants and stakeholders must have access to all related information.  The model is a public private partnership where all operational information is available.  It is no good keeping secrets.  If the plan is to be implemented, everybody must be fully aware of what is happening.<\/p><p> The management structure is two-tier.  There is the executive-operational side and the supervisory side which, hopefully, will include a public private partnership with local authorities as they gain or lose on the success of the retail sector.  The outcome should be an inviting and attractive environment to  entice people back into town centre shopping.  The business perspective should adopt a more consumer, customer-centred and responsible relationship which has been lacking. <\/p><p> We could ask what happened in the retail sector in 2008.  Shopping habits changed and there was an economic implosion.  Therefore, we have to go back and restore the credibility we had to respond to customer needs.  I think we lost that to some extent.  <\/p><p> In summary, retail is changing and will continue to do so.  The danger points include the traditional retail sector.  The shopping template seeks to whip this sector with the synergy and resources to successfully embrace these challenges.  The individual shop retains its traditional ethos but now has access to online e-commerce, digital marketing and group-based business savings.  In addition, the group-based communal collegiate structure provides a very positive business environment.  However, we are losing that because of apathy, which is our biggest enemy.  We have to restore that confidence in the environment.<\/p><p> The wider 360 degree development embraces issues such as local tourism.  It is all based on group support which we have had in the past.  Clearly, the success of the co-operatives all started with local need.  For example, the credit unions responded to a local need.  It is clear from driving around the country that the need now is to restore an economic model for every locality.  The essence of any business is that it needs to sell a product and if it does not, the business does not happen.  Part of our structure is that we are embracing small businesses, micro-businesses, local tourism and retail, and in the middle of that structure we have a county marketing company.  I would like to claim that the county marketing company was my idea or our idea but in essence it is copied off the Alibaba model that the Chinese used very successfully for many years, as a gateway for their own producers.  What we have done is that we have borrowed, adjusted and got a model whereby we should go into every county.  Therefore if a shoe shop wants to sell product online or services online we have one common point to do it.  That provides scale to the smaller producer and gives him a leg-up in terms of getting into the market place.  We need to achieve more business and growth in business.  However, we cannot achieve growth under present circumstances.  I am not criticising the State  bodies in place.  They were formed in completely different economic circumstances.<\/p> <p>We are trying to work on developing a relationship with them.  If we can do so, we will deliver a better synergy and impact to the business sector on a group basis.<\/p><p> I could talk about this for hours, but the committee has a report.  That is a template, though, and is not complete.  It is deliberately structured in that way because it can be modified to suit requirements in different areas.  There might be a different set of requirements in Monaghan than there is in Mayo, for example.  This template can be implemented quickly.  We are not discussing major costs or structures.  Rather, we are discussing entering a community, engaging with it on its needs and, once we know those, setting about delivering the necessary solutions.  The report outlines some of our target areas - energy, the retail sector, local tourism and a crucial project called trade bridge.  We have people in Ireland who are producing a product with export potential, but who will be defeated by the shared costs and logistics involved in accessing an export market.  In recent years, I have spoken with the Irish diaspora in the UK, for example, the members of which have been broadly supportive of creating a bridge into the UK market.  In this way, the person selling widgets is allowed to expand that operation.  Ireland does not have the growth potential to do that.<\/p><p> We are trying to support local retailers, harness green energy's potential locally and promote local tourism, retailers and small businesses that are on a knife's edge but that, with a little support, could be brought back into the fold.  In this way, we could drive potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100007#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404228600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.

There is a woman - I will not tell the committee where she is - who makes the same brown soda bread that the Deputy or I would make.  She puts it into a van twice per week and sends it to Manchester.  She is not a HPSU, but she employs two or three people.

Will the municipal districts encompassing a number of large towns and their hinterlands and the elected chairs of same create an extra focus on this matter?<\/p><p>  In terms of reviving town centres, Mr. Moran mentioned painting shops.

There are towns that have not got the message that they need to improve their overall image.  It can be a killer.  If the main street of any town looks dull, the immediate image is of nothing happening.  On the other hand, if a town's image is positive because it has been painted and cleaned, that is a first step.  The message needs to be extended.  It is simple, but it is positive and many small towns need to embrace it.<\/p><p>  The LEOs are fairly new organisations and need time to bed in.  I do not know the timeline for them to become effective, but they should theoretically be a major player in this regard.  Our focus is on marketing as a business must have a market to be effective.  Unfortunately, LEOs do not place this emphasis on marketing.  However, I see no major conflict there.<\/p><p>  In one of our studies, we examined an OECD report that strategised and practised local development from the ground up.  The OECD believes it has devised some competent models.  I have provided the committee with an insight into the OECD's thinking in this regard.  The future will be bottom-up development across the board, including education and economic development.  The OECD conducted a report on this for the Welsh Assembly recently.  There is a parallel with Ireland.  If one wants to know which structures work, the local development structure has that potential.  Go back far enough and consider our success stories, for example, local credit unions, which responded to a need.  They were set up in small villages and towns.  Now, we need to rebuild local economies.  We can harness local development.  We have a legacy in this regard.  We are not just inventing it.  The co-op movement stemmed from a need to do something.  We must revisit this approach.  As to how to do this in co-operation with LEOs, we should not try to reinvent the wheel.  Rather, we should try for a level of co-operation that suits the existing skill sets.<\/p><p>  That said, we do work that LEOs do not.  A marketing focus is central from our point of view.  We want to do the same in terms of tourism.  Ireland generally has a good tourism product, but it is like a jigsaw - we have the bits and pieces.  We are trying to integrate our tourism offering so that people are encouraged to stay in areas for longer.  There are synergies with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in pushing this agenda along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1404228600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Surely the role of LEOs and the local community development associations within same is to market their respective counties and cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070100009#J00700","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404228600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I have in mind a dedicated Alibaba-type central marketing site with both an online and offline presence.

Members had envisaged the commission would have been in possession of the submission for at least one week by this stage, whereby the committee would be privy to it.  It would have been open to members to question its contents and to scrutiny by members on behalf of the public in such a way that they could be sure the commission would be making an informed decision in adjudicating on it and other matters pertaining to submissions the commission has received to date and so forth.  I believe this was the second time the commission was given a commitment by Irish Water that the aforementioned document would be made available to it.  On the first occasion, the committee agreed to delay its meeting to accommodate the submission.  I do not wish to mince my words, but members are very disappointed - many are annoyed - by the attitude of Irish Water and its treatment of both the committee and, by association, the commission.<br\/>We will do what we can within the confines of the meeting - considering that we lack much valued information - now that we are getting down to the nitty-gritty of the process whereby the actual charging system and the principles behind it are to be agreed to and published, with a further public consultation process emanating therefrom.  It has been delayed further and is one of a series of delays during the process.  While I recognise the Commission for Energy Regulation has no responsibility in this regard, the point must be made.  Members will deal with the many queries we have about the commission in the process to date.  In addition, we ask the commission to consider appearing again before the committee when it has received the aforementioned submission and had time to digest and assimilate it, thereby allowing members further opportunities to scrutinise its contents and seek the commission's thoughts and opinions on what has been submitted to it.

We will be happy to come back before it at any time that suits it.  It is important for us to have a frank and open discussion of all the issues involved.  It affects water consumers nationwide and obviously is very important.  I will talk members through the first couple of slides, after which I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. McGowan, who is the lead commissioner for water services and will talk them through the rest of the slides.  In this presentation we intend to cover a brief description of our broader role which does not simply cover water services but also covers energy and safety matters.  Thereafter, I will hand over to Mr. McGowan who will cover water charging matters and the issues of customer protection and timelines, within which context the delays will be covered.<\/p><p>  I will talk briefly about the Commission for Energy Regulation's broader role and note that it has been the energy regulator since late 1999-2000.  We started out covering the supply of electricity and soon thereafter the supply of gas.  We cover the electricity and gas networks, as well as the retail and wholesale markets in electricity and gas.  We also have a broader consumer function in energy matters.  In the intervening period there has been significant investment and, I hope, some stability from a regulatory point of view.  We work very much in a European context on the energy side.  Consequently, we have a broad economic, safety and consumer protection function in energy matters, much of which is driven by directives at European level.<\/p><p>  We have been appointed this year as economic regulator for water services, a new function for us.  However, there are some similarities and an overlap with the functions we carry out in respect of energy matters.  I hope we will use and reuse some of our in-house expertise to supplement the additional staff we have available to look directly at water services.  <\/p><p>  We also have a consumer interest at our heart.  I note that our strategic statement for the organisation has been refreshed recently, particularly with reference to water services being one of our new functions.<\/p> <p>In that statement, we set out that reliable water, efficient delivery of safe water and efficient waste water is a key strategic objective from our organisation.

I will talk them through where we are on various aspects of the water charges plan and our recent consultation on tariff structures.<\/p><p>  The water charges plan is designed to cover the water charges, how they are calculated and the likely costs that are incurred by Uisce &Eacute;ireann in discharging its functions as the Irish water utility.  We wrote to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to request a submission on its water charge plan.  This will cover the period October 2014 to the end of 2016.  It is just over two years - what we would call interim revenue control rather than full revenue control because of its relatively short duration.<\/p><p>  The guidance that we have issued to Irish Water in respect of its water charges plan is based on the Minister's water charges policy direction, which was published in draft form a number of weeks ago.  It is also informed by our review of the responses that we received to our two main publications on tariffs, namely the Domestic Water Tariff Principles and Proposals consultation paper and the Interim and Enduring Non-Domestic Water Tariff Proposals consultation.<\/p><p>  I will briefly go through the presentation because the draft policy direction has been in the public domain for some time.  The policy direction applies to the interim regulatory control period of Q4 2014 to the end of 2016.  A key for us is that we must be consistent with the conditions of funding that are set out by the Department to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  These conditions are set out by the Department in a letter to Uisce &Eacute;ireann but that letter is incorporated into the policy direction and, therefore, we must comply with that as well.<\/p><p>  It includes matters relating to free allowances, such as the 30,000 litres per child per household as well as a 38,000 litres allowance in primary residences.  That 38,000 litres per annum is to be verified through an actual metered consumption data analysis.<\/p><p>  The charges are to be fixed to the end of 2016.  As the committee probably will be aware, there is to be no domestic standing charge for residencies but there is a discretion for there to be a minimum water charge for non-primary residences.  The latter is something we propose to have.<\/p><p>  The draft policy direction via the incorporation of a letter to Uisce &Eacute;ireann is quite clear that the average annual bill to the end of 2016 for those households with combined services, that is, water and waste water, is not to exceed &euro;240.  It is important to note that this is an average figure.  It would have been envisaged that some households would incur charges above that and other households would incur charges below that, but that the average would be &euro;240.<\/p><p>  The direction also is clear that the assessed charge, where no meter is available and, therefore, customers are to have an assessed charge for their water and waste water services, is to be based primarily on occupancy and also that in the transition from an assessed charge to a metered charge, there is to be a retrospective adjustment to ensure that customers who, for example, pay less on the assessed charge than they subsequently pay on the meter charge will have a cap placed on their charges for a period of time at the assessed charge and, equally, those whose metered charge turns out to cheaper than the assessed charge will have some form of rebate to reflect the fact that their consumption is lower.  There is also a key provision in the policy direction on impaired services where water quality is impaired and arrangements that are to be put in place in those circumstances.  I suppose the key point there is that it relates to where water quality is such that it is not fit for human consumption.<\/p><p>  The next slide in the presentation gives an overview of the broad issues that were raised on the domestic water tariff consultation that we carried out.  We had, from our perspective, a large response.  Some 153 individual responses were received to the consultation.  There was a range of responses and I will give the committee some sense of what they were.<\/p><p>  There was a lot of response around the area of social protection measures.  Affordability measures are not a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We do not set, for example, policy on whether customers receive any form of financial assistance with the water bills.  We set the bills but affordability measures are a matter for Government policy.  Nonetheless, customers have identified various affordability issues, such as low incomes, the elderly, customers with disabilities and medically vulnerable customers.  Some of these feed through into tariff proposals, particularly in relation to what might apply for those who have medical conditions such that they have high water usage.<\/p><p>  The responses also focused on matters such as encouraging water conservation through rain water harvesting.  In fact, one of the areas identified is that those with harvesting already deployed would be prioritised in terms of having their meter installed because, clearly, they would benefit from lower bills if they are deploying such technology.  As the committee can imagine, there were a lot of responses around water quality issues.  For example, there is a lot of concern out there about hard water and customers requesting that tariff discounts should apply in those areas.<\/p><p>  A matter on many customers' minds was the area of flexible payments and the ability to pay by a range of means, from cash to direct debit to more flexible payment arrangements, such as Pay Zone.  Customers also raised issues such as the need for minimum pressure standards and how customers access their meter data to determine their level of water usage.  Other matters that were raised included how would rebates be managed following somebody's transition from a high assessed charge to a lower metered charge, but that is covered off in the ministerial direction.<\/p><p>  The next area on which we consulted was interim and enduring non-domestic water tariffs.  I would remind the committee there is already a series of tariffs in place for the non-domestic sector.  These have been in place for a number of years.  The issue here is that the tariff arrangements varied across all then 34 local water authorities and as a result, there are, we believe, in the order of 600 different tariff designs in the non-domestic sector at present.<\/p><p>  Our proposal was that we would retain the existing tariff structures, we would focus on the introduction of domestic water charges and, subsequently, once all the information relating to the full range of non-domestic tariffs was gathered by Irish Water, we would then assess what sort of tariff arrangements are needed and how we might put a glide path in place to allow for a transition from the current mix of tariffs to the enduring tariff arrangement.  That was our broad proposal.<\/p><p>  We had 14 responses to that consultation.  Generally speaking, there was broad support for the idea that we would retain the current arrangements.  Specific questions were raised.  For example, where entities have particular contracts with their existing water authority, how would those existing contracts be treated and taken into account?<\/p><p>  It was also pointed out in a number of responses that it is not acceptable that the domestic portion of mixed use customers would not be charged for water usage.  Typically, an example of this might be where there is mixed use, that is, a domestic dwelling with some form of commercial premises attached where there would traditionally a free water allowance associated with the domestic element because there was no domestic water charging, and then the remainder would be charged at the business rate.  Many respondents pointed out that, if that were to continue, then a cohort of domestic customers would not be charged for domestic water charges.<\/p><p>  As I already pointed out, we are minded to look at how we put in place a glide path for any new tariff for the non-domestic sector, but the responses also sought that there would be no shocks.  I suppose that is a plea that the glide path would take account of the need to move progressively to the steady state rather than over a very short period of time by introducing large price changes, whether they be up or down.<\/p> <p>Another plea was that there should be no cost subsidy from the non-domestic sector to the domestic sector.<\/p><p> Let me address the advice we have given Irish Water to guide it on how it should put together its water charges plan.  First, we have given it broad support regarding principles and objectives.  In this regard, the charges should be equitable and non-discriminatory and designed to ensure efficiency in the use of water.  They should be cost reflective, recover the costs efficiently incurred in delivering the service, stable and, where possible, simple.  Clearly, not all of these objectives are equally achievable.  Therefore, there is a balance to be struck between all principles and objectives.<\/p><p> With regard to tariff structures, there will be a national tariff.  There will be a 50:50 split between the cost for both water and wastewater services.  If the total cost is &euro;100, &euro;50 goes towards water supply and &euro;50 towards wastewater services.  There would be no standing charge.  Much of this is in line with the policy direction.<\/p><p> The average household charge, as the committee is aware, has to be capped at &euro;240 per annum.  This is an average rather than a maximum charge.  If &euro;240 is the average, it stands to reason some households will incur a charge above &euro;240, while others will incur a charge below it.<\/p><p> We have asked Uisce &Eacute;ireann to prepare a proposal on a minimum fee for services to non-primary residences or houses not normally occupied such as holiday homes.  This recognises the fact that even with zero consumption, there is not a zero cost in ensuring the availability of water at the premises.<\/p><p> On affordability measures, there is a free allowance of 30,000 litres per household.  The Government, in its policy direction, indicated that there should be an allowance of 38,000 litres per child, unless more robust research on consumption and losses is prepared.  We understand that, on the basis of metering work already done, Uisce &Eacute;ireann has carried out some research on current usage and proposes to seek a reduction from 38,000 litres per child because it does not believe this accurately reflects the rate of usage of a child.  It will propose a reduction, but we must be satisfied that the statistical analysis behind the figure is robust before we move to accept it, or any other figure.  It is important to bear in mind that if the analysis shows that the consumption per child is not 38,000 litres per annum, reflecting this in charges would ensure no cross-subsidisation between households with children and households without children.  That is why it is important to understand whether the analysis is accurate.<\/p><p> On assessed charges, we have advised and guided Irish Water to the effect that one's assessed charge is to be capped for a period of six months after the introduction of the meter.  If somebody is on an assessed charge of &euro;240, the average in the Government's direction, and his or her meter-based charge is subsequently recorded as higher, it will be capped at &euro;240.  Consumption by a family could be higher than average because of greater consumption or a leak.  Our guidance suggests a first fix must be carried out before any cap is removed.  Equally, if a metered individual discovers subsequently that his or her water usage is very low by comparison with the usage pertaining to the assessed charge, there is to be a rebate.<\/p><p> On medical conditions, the guidance to Irish Water is that charges are to be capped at the relevant assessed charge.  Based on advice that we would be expecting to receive from the Government via the Department of Health on what medical conditions warrant being categorised as relevant, the customers in the relevant categories would have their water charges capped at the relevant assessed charge.<\/p><p> With regard to impaired services, our focus is on water that might be unfit for human consumption.  The guidance issued to Uisce &Eacute;ireann is that, in preparing its proposals, it should consider a 50% reduction in the water supply portion of the bill.  The analysis from other countries indicates that approximately 10% of water consumed in a household is actually used for drinking and food preparation; the remainder is for other uses.  The figure of 50% represents a considerably higher proportion of the water normally consumed by the householders.  It is probably also greater than the typical reduction that would apply in other jurisdictions.  We are open to the idea that the reduction could be greater, depending on the severity of circumstances.  For example, if people have been subject to a boil water notice for a considerable period, there may be circumstances in which the reduction of 50% could be increased.<\/p><p> We have provided Uisce &Eacute;ireann with further guidance on what \"in a timely manner\" means.  Ministerial directions refer to \"in a timely manner\" in respect of meeting Uisce &Eacute;ireann's customer service obligations according to the customer handbook.  We have asked the company to prepare a customer impact analysis.  Essentially, this would examine various customer types and provide an analysis of the typical charges for the range of customer types.  It would give the minimum and maximum we would expect to see in respect of known consumption patterns.  I refer also to the numbers of people on charges in between.  That is the typical distribution analysis we would have carried out when setting tariffs.<\/p><p> I raised the issue of mixed-use customers in regard to the feedback on the non-domestic charges.  We have identified that we expect domestic charges to apply to the domestic portion of mixed-use premises from 1 October 2014.  Whether Irish Water will have the data available to start billing from 1 October, we are not yet sure.  As a principle, we have stated charges should accrue from that date.  This is to ensure all people in domestic premises will be subject to water charges.  We believe this is an equitable position to take, given that this is all about the introduction of domestic water charges.<\/p><p> On the non-domestic side, we have indicated that the current charging regime is to apply until such time as the new tariff arrangements and charges are approved by the CER.  To that end, we are in discussions with Uisce &Eacute;ireann on putting together a plan, to be published later this year, for how we propose to go about non-domestic water charging and creating the glide path to which I referred.<\/p><p> We have clarified that later this year we will issue a consultation document on connection charges and what connection charges will apply in the water sector.  The water customer handbook is essentially a set of rules that we put out for consultation in terms of how Uisce &Eacute;ireann should deal with its customers.  There are various headings, including how to communicate with customers, how bills should be issued, the format of bills, how regularly customers are to be billed, metering and how to deal with vulnerable customers.  We proposed various requirements in our consultation under all of these headings and received 30 responses.<\/p> <p> Some 15 of the submissions were from representative bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Health Service Executive and the National Consumer Agency, while 15 were received from individuals.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that as part of our overall stakeholder engagement, we do have a forum established whereby we speak to various consumer representative bodies, including the SVP and MABS, in order to understand the issues customers face on various matters such as methods of paying bills.<\/p><p> Generally speaking, there was broad support for the customer service obligations that were set out in the handbook.  These would subsequently be set out in the codes of practice by Irish Water.<\/p><p> Turning to timelines, in February, we sent the Minister our advice on the economic regulatory framework.  In April, we followed that up with our consultations - to which I have just referred - on tariff structures around domestic and non-domestic charges, and the water customer handbook consultation.  In May, we published an information note on the connection charging policy, essentially identifying that we propose to keep the existing connection charging policy across various areas as represented by the previous local authority areas.  <\/p><p> We had expected to issue the water charges plan for consultation in June, but that will now be in July.  This schedule was always a challenging timeline.  It is true there have been delays with Uisce &Eacute;ireann providing us with a full submission.  There is a significant amount of work involved in ensuring that the draft water charges plan is consistent with the draft Government direction of 6 May and, in particular, with regard to meeting the market corporation test that is part of that overall policy direction.  <\/p><p> At this stage, we expect to publish the economic regulatory framework response document in July.  The actual economic regulatory framework, as submitted to the Department, has already been published on its website.  This is our document which details all the responses we had to that particular consultation.<\/p><p> We will also put out the water charges plan, which will include allowed revenue and tariff structures and levels, for consultation in July.  We will also issue our decision on the water customer handbook.  This means that it will be September when we issue our decision on the water charges plan.  Subsequently, we will consult on the connection charging policy in the fourth quarter of this year. <\/p><p> We expect to receive a final submission from Uisce &Eacute;ireann tomorrow, 2 July, on the water charges plan.  We hope to publish that very soon thereafter.  We will enter into a fairly detailed consultation in the next couple of weeks.  We will have our own water charges plan consultation paper.  We will have Uisce &Eacute;ireann's allowed revenue submission on what resources it feels it needs to run the water company for the period up to the end of 2016.  There will be our review of that revenue submission.  There will also be Uisce &Eacute;ireann's own water charges plan submission with supporting information setting out what it thinks the tariff levels should be and why.  Then there will be our own consultation response papers on the domestic and non-domestic tariff proposals.  Therefore it will be a considerable volume of documentation.<\/p><p> At that point in time, we will be more than happy to come back to discuss those papers and the various submissions with the joint committee.  In July, we will also publish our decision on the customer handbook.  The decision on the water charges plan will be issued in September.<\/p><p> That is the end of the presentation.  I am sorry that it was probably a bit lengthier than I expected it to be, but there was a lot to cover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404231000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Not at all.  I thank Mr. McGowan for his statement and what was contained in it.  Despite the fact that many of his views and contentions are well meant, I do not think they can be fully substantiated until such time as they are challenged by virtue of a submission by Irish Water and by others, including political parties and various organisations throughout the State which will have much to say about that.<\/p><p>  Having listened to Mr. McGowan's statement, I was struck when he said it was understood that Irish Water does not necessarily agree with the free allowance calculation of 38,000 litres per child.  In recent months, we were led to believe that was clear but it is now not the case.  <\/p><p>  Mr. McGowan also mentioned the first-fix policy, which we were led to believe was clear and concise when the Government spoke about it in months past.  However, when they were questioned about the 5% of housing throughout the country with lead pipes - and the costs associated with rectification works - we were informed that it may not be what it says on the tin.  They are just two examples that jump out at me.  It makes me wonder how Mr. McGowan will react to Irish Water's contentions in these areas. <\/p><p>  The bigger question in the public mind is the commissioner's response to a request, in 2012, by Bord G&aacute;is for a 7.5% recommended price increase.  Mr. McGowan granted them an 8.5% increase, so how can the public be sure that he is on the consumers' side and will not be subsumed by this monopoly which is Irish Water?  Will he have consumers' best interests at heart?  That is the overriding question at the back of many people's minds.<\/p><p>  The situation is exacerbated, and members of the public are becoming more worried and nervous, because Irish Water had guaranteed a submission to the commissioner in weeks past and prior to our meeting today.  Yet here we are again without such a submission, which is the substance of what we wanted to discuss.  Notwithstanding Mr. McGowan's views and contentions regarding the legislation and his role, his interpretation of that submission is something we need to know.  We will not get that information today, however.  I am glad that Mr. McGowan has agreed to return to the joint committee when he is in receipt of that submission.  It is only then that many of us, and many organisations, will be able to make more meaningful submissions themselves.<\/p><p>  I have a few brief questions to ask.  We will all get to speak but the order if which that will take place is - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour or Fine Gael, and the Technical Group.

My first point concerns flat rate charges.  There has been a delay in the timescale but there will be no delay in charging, although Mr. McGowan did not allude to that.  We know that about 1 million homes will not be metered when charges are introduced, despite the fact that &euro;530 million will have been spent on metering.  Mr. McGowan said he hoped to put structures in place for rebates on homes that may be overcharged when one compares the assessed charge with the actual charge when the metering system is put in place.  What examples or models of assessment - or countries where such assessment takes place - has Mr. McGowan investigated in order to arrive at his decision in this regard?  In other words, what real examples on the ground can Mr. McGowan point to which show that the occupancy and potential water usage of a house is being properly assessed, and so that people can have faith and confidence in his decision on flat rate charging?<\/p><p>  My second point concerns the quality of water supply, which is something to which Mr. McGowan alluded during his presentation.  He said he was looking at a 50% reduction on the element of water within that bill, which is essentially a 25% reduction.  <\/p> <p>Mr. McGowan says that the CER may allow for further reductions where a boil notice has existed for a certain length of time, if there is a risk of lead poisoning.  Given the difficulties that exist in the country, should the CER not have a more definitive idea of how any such assessment in that area would be addressed?  Is that any comfort to the people in Roscommon for example?  I acknowledge that rectification measures will be taken in the coming years but meanwhile they, and others like them, would need a more definitive response from the CER.  Consumers do not have much faith in the CER&rsquo;s role and they question its standing when they see that in the past somebody who looked for a 7.5% increase got an 8.5% increase.  It has a job to do to obtain people&rsquo;s trust.  A comment that lacks clarity about a process that is over two years old needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> In respect of medical requirements, Mr. McGowan says the CER will be guided by Government on the detail and impact of medical requirements provisions.  At what point will the cap be set?  Does he have an opinion on this or is he totally dependent on Government direction?  Someone who has home dialysis needs clarity and a definitive indication from the CER, even in the absence of any submission from Irish Water, that it has case studies from other jurisdictions where best practice exists, which will be implemented in this State.<\/p><p> Initially it was thought that there would be a standing charge and that was dropped for political reasons.  I have since studied the indicative pricing mechanism that has been mentioned, which suggests the prices might be higher.  A representative of Irish Water said at the time that, irrespective of there being a standing charge, it will receive the sort of funding it expected anyhow.  Does Mr. McGowan have any concerns that, in the absence of a standing charge, Irish Water will struggle to attract international investment and, if so, will struggle to implement the commitment it has given to the electorate to address the deficiencies in the systems?  In what circumstances can the charges be finalised in August and not be amended before the end of 2016?  Is that subject to a ministerial direction?  If this is set in stone do we have a guarantee that the CER will not interfere with it until 2016?<\/p><p> The cost is approximately &euro;1.2 billion per annum with &euro;700 million going on capital expenditure and &euro;500 million on capital investment.  The Government has yet to outline how much it will provide to subsidise Irish Water.  This year, for example, &euro;500 million was raised from local property tax, which had been earmarked for local government but was diverted to Irish Water.  The Government has yet to outline how much money it will pour in to enable it to carry out significant infrastructural investment.  In the absence of that commitment on the subsidy is the CER operating in the dark?  If Mr. McGowan cannot answer my previous question about international investment is he doubly worried that the Government has not made a funding commitment to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100006#G00400","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404231600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I will address some of the questions and pass others to my colleagues.  It probably is fair to say that it is up to the CER to establish itself as the economic regulator for water, to show by its actions that it does have customer interest at heart and is acting in the public interest when it comes to water charges.  In respect of the Bord G&aacute;is price increases, we did not award a higher increase than was sought.  Bord G&aacute;is asked for 7.5% but subsequently the international price of gas went up and its request went over 8.5% which we awarded but which was less than it asked for.  Those were the facts.  Our record will show that we have always shown a healthy level of scepticism about requests for price increases in submissions from utility companies.  It will also show that we have rarely awarded an increase higher than the one sought.  Invariably we have managed to find efficiencies which the utility company had not identified and therefore lessened the impact on the utility customer.  It is important to reassure people that is the approach we take to water, a healthy level of scepticism of the submissions from utilities in order to ensure that only costs that are warranted and efficiently incurred are passed through to consumers.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the consultation process in July is to put forward our views and submissions from Irish Water in order to gain feedback from the public rather than put out definitive positions which people would rightly criticise us for as being diktat rather than public consultation.  We have to strike a balance and not be completely definitive because otherwise we run the risk of not going through the process according to good regulatory practice.  Where we are of the view that particular issues need to be addressed in a certain way we will put out a &ldquo;minded to&rdquo; position and will be clear.<\/p><p>  The key issue in respect of water quality is people&rsquo;s ability to consume the water.  There should be a reduction in the charge where it is not drinkable.  We have said that the minimum level for that is 50%.  We are now looking to consult on whether there should be circumstances in which it should be higher than 50%, perhaps even 100% where it has been undrinkable for a prolonged period.  We do not want to be definitive about that.  We want to put it out to public consultation.<\/p><p>  It would be very unwise of the CER to offer a view of what medical conditions would warrant a cap on water charges.

Various potential tariff structures are used in other jurisdictions across Europe.  Payments can be based on rateable value, for example, or purely based on consumption.  It is clear that one of the stated aims of water charging in Ireland is to reduce overall consumption and thereby conserve water, which is a precious resource.  One could argue that a water charge which is purely based on quantity is a rational response to that goal.  Equally, we would have argued in favour of a system that takes account of the fact that a zero cost is not associated with dwellings that are not primary residences and have zero consumption.  One would expect that there would be a level of consumption in all households with residential occupancy, but there might not be any consumption in premises with no residents.  It is important that a minimum charge is associated with those premises.<\/p><p>  On the specific question of Irish Water's ability to attract finance regardless of whether there is a standing charge, the feedback we have got from the ratings agencies indicates that the foremost issue is the stability of the regulatory regime.  One of the key areas we addressed early in this process was what the overall regulatory regime would look like.  When we issued our advice to the Minister - that has now been published - we focused on the idea that we would go through six-year revenue controls and identify a reasonable return and a reasonable cost of debt, etc.  That indicates to rating agencies and the wider capital markets that the utility has a reasonably robust revenue stream in order to meet its funding commitments.  I would contend that the markets look at that level of information, rather than the minutiae of particular tariff structures.  My colleagues might have other points to make in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100008#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404232200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I would like to emphasise the importance of capital for us.  The water industry is a very capital-intensive industry.  There is a great deal of further capital investment to be made.  It is very important for us to be able to access cheap finance.  We believe that part of the role of the regulator is to provide the stability and the framework to encourage people to make investments that are not based on the view of the Minister of the day.  There should be regulatory certainty over a continuous period of time.  We have seen significant capital investment and relatively low-cost financing within the energy sector.  We hope to use the regulatory certainty and the model in that regard to assist the water sector.  At one point at the height of the crisis, the cost of debt for the various utilities was lower than the cost for the Government.  The capital markets value regulatory certainty.  It has a measurable value for consumers.  We have been in discussions with some of the big international funders.  I think they will want to see some certainty, particularly around the revenue streams for Irish Water.  I do not think we will get international finance from day one.  It will probably take some time for that to develop.  The more that can be done on a stand-alone basis, the better.  We will continue that.

We have asked it to do that analysis and provide it to us as part of its submission to us.  I know from a preliminary view of other markets that it is based on property value in the UK, for example.  We did not think that was an appropriate way to proceed because there is no link between the value of a property and how much water is used in that property.  I am aware from our discussions with Irish Water that there is no link between the amount of water one uses and the size of a house or the number of bathrooms, toilets and bedrooms in that house.  That is why we are coming to the view that occupancy seems to be the closest indicator we can find.  We have asked Irish Water to gather a lot of data about the number of people living in houses, their ages and how many of them are children or older people to see whether there is a link between such factors and water usage .  That is why we will have the rebate system in place.  If we get the assessed charge slightly wrong, a rebate will apply.  The information about how much water people use is only coming in now.

We were asked whether the charges that will apply from October to the end of December 2016 are fixed in stone.  They are subject to two caveats.  First, the Minister can always issue a policy direction.  However, he has given no indication that he will issue any policy direction in this area.  He is very clear that it is fixed until the end of December 2016.  The only area where we have to be careful relates to the free allowance of 38,000 litres of water per child.  The policy direction requires validation of that figure.  In other words, a decision will have to be made on whether that figure is appropriate or should be lower.  Irish Water will make a submission to us in that regard.  If we think the evidence is robust, we will take it into consideration.  If we do not think it is, we will get Irish Water to carry out more analysis.  We will then decide what to do with that information.  We might decide to wait until the end of the two-year period, or we might ask the Minister to consider a different figure at some time during that period.  As Mr. McGowan said, it is very important for us to get that figure correct.  If the allowance per child is significantly over-inflated, people living in a house where there are no children, or where the children are over the age of 18, will be paying more than they should because we have provided for an allowance that is too high in respect of children under the age of 18.  We have to weigh up the interests of all consumers carefully when we are determining what the right figure is.<\/p><p>  We were also asked whether we have figures for the level of subvention from the Government.  The charges will be fixed for a period of two and a quarter years.  When we are making a decision on the charges, we will need to know exactly how much we will get from tariffs and from the Government's subvention.  When Irish Water makes its submission to us and we publish our figures, we will make it clear to everybody how much money will be provided by the Government over two and a half years.  We will also set out the level of the charges, the number of people who will pay those charges and how much revenue it will bring in.  We will do the maths at the very end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100008#J01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Has the commission received a commitment from the Government in relation to the subvention over the next two and a quarter years?

I hope I will be present for the response but it will be recorded nonetheless.  Medical conditions are an important consideration.  The Minister said - I read it in the newspapers this morning - that medical conditions will be assessed and consultations will take place.  When I read that, I was assured that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Health in consultation would set down the specifics.  The CER is not an expert in health.  What is the importance of consulting it on health matters?  It is clearly set out in the water policy direction that both Ministers would get together on the issue.  We must ensure that all of the necessary health grounds are set out.  We should be able to tell the Minister that the CER thinks A, B and C should be considered.  Is it possible to outline those points today?<\/p><p>  The Minister set out in directive 5 that there would be a free allowance for households and children.  An upper age limit has been set at 18 for the definition of a child who is in school or college.  What if young people are working?  Will that be considered to be a policy direction?<\/p><p>  Another directive from the Minister related to a reduction in the charge in the event of water quality being inadequate or where there is impaired service.  The CER has taken that into consideration.  A rebate will be available for impaired service.  If boil restrictions are in place, a rebate will also be available.  How will the rebate be managed or who will say a person did not have X amount of water for six months?  Will it be the local authority, Uisce &Eacute;ireann or the regulator?  How will a decision be made on rebates?<\/p><p>  I note that 153 submissions were received by the CER and they are being taken into consideration.  I made a submission on medical issues and water conservation.  Could the CER indicate whether it will make recommendations or if the Minister will make them to facilitate water harvesting and other such measures?  The Minister has referred to the matter also.<\/p><p>  I welcome the accelerated metering of apartments.  Does it mean it will happen in two months, six months or a year?<\/p><p>  The CER stated in its submission that discounts will apply where water is unfit for human consumption.  The Minister referred to it also in his directive.  The CER will publish regulations in December.  The first fix will be free.  People are worried about what the cost will be if leaks are discovered.  In the event that only 10% of water is used in a property, will a recommendation be made on that and will there be separation at source.  If only 10% of water is used then it is very expensive to treat it all.  There is much waste involved if water is leaking.  It is expensive to treat water that is flushed down the toilet.  Reed bed treatment is being used in Offaly rather than the more expensive conventional treatment.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to what happens in the United Kingdom.  The system in Northern Ireland is the same as in the United Kingdom which means we do not have to look too far up the road to see the charges are more and are based on property value.  There is no encouragement for people conserve water.  Will there be a directive on education in terms of water conservation and will there be an onus on schools, parents, local authority representatives and Oireachtas Members to play a part in educating people to conserve water?<\/p><p>  Reference was made in the directive that came from the Minister to a fixed fee until 2016.  Because it is a statutory directive I do not believe it will be changed or could be changed until after 2016.

If a customer feels that Irish Water has not complied with them he or she can complain to Irish Water and if he or she does not get the expected answer or he or she is unhappy with the response then ultimately a complaint can be made to us.<\/p><p>  We would not give particular recommendations on water harvesting.  What we will do is work with Irish Water through, for example, our research and development fund, and its obligation to give information on water conservation to customers.  Ultimately, this is about water conservation so even water charging based on metered consumption is a water conservation measure of itself.  As with various other ideas such as, for example, a schools programme, those are the type of things we would encourage Irish Water to work on and develop proposals.  We will give it an allowance for a certain amount of research and development but there will be other agencies it can work with in that regard.  That is certainly something we would promote as part of the overall package of water regulation, and for Irish Water to engage with the water customer.<\/p><p>  To be clear, it is not a case of accelerated metering of apartments, it is an accelerated roll out of metering to those who rainwater harvest and who want to avail of the advantage that gives.

In excess of &euro;185 million is earmarked to be spent on the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a corporate entity.  The commission&rsquo;s role is like that of county councillors in monitoring water services and their improvements while the executive role has been handed over to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Public representatives would traditionally have had an input into this process but now we do not which is very frustrating.  What is the commission&rsquo;s view on this, particularly as there have been no improvements or fixing of leaks yet?<\/p><p>  In a reply to a question on a capital project for a wastewater treatment in my constituency, Irish Water stated, as a regulated national utility, it must submit its proposed capital investment plan to the regulator which will assess it to ensure it is appropriate and delivers value for money for customers.  Ultimately, it is the Commission for Energy Regulation that decides what investments can be made.  Would the commission go to, say, Rathdowney, County Laois, to determine whether a new sewage treatment plant is required for the town?  Would it talk to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, local businesses and people on the need for such a plant?  Is this a correct interpretation of the commission&rsquo;s role in deciding capital investment plans?<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and Children and Health Service Executive will set out the parameters for charge exemptions and medical conditions.  For those with a disability which might not fit into the criteria of a medical condition, will they come in under that heading?  When the Bill was going through the D&aacute;il, I submitted amendments to exempt pensioners, particularly those living on just a State pension, from water charges.  What is the commission&rsquo;s view on such an exemption?<\/p> <p>The witnesses stated the average charge per household should be no more than &euro;240 per annum from now until the end of 2016, and that is fair enough.  In terms of the minimum charge, an elderly person who lives alone may spend time in respite care or with relatives or may have periods of hospitalisation.  They may spend periods of time outside the State, such as living with relatives abroad for a period of time.  Do the witnesses have a view on a minimum charge for primary residents?<\/p><p> This charge will work in two ways.  There will be the charge for the household through the bill and a transfer of money from the Exchequer, or from the property tax as happened this year of &euro;186 million.  What percentage should be in the bill which comes in the post and what percentage should continue to be subvented by the Exchequer and taken from general taxation?<\/p><p> With regard to the economic rate, it has been stated there will be no change until 2016.  What do the witnesses see as the economic rate?  Have they done a calculation on the economic rate for water?  What does it actually cost to provide it per household?  Do they see it moving quickly towards the full economic rate being included in the bill in the post, perhaps over three to six years?  In other words, the full economic rate would be levied through water charges.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach has answered the question on the reduction in supply as he told us a long time ago there would be a reduction in supply for people who cannot pay or who will not pay.  There are probably people who cannot pay, such as those in negative equity.  They are already on a starvation diet and freezing during the winter trying to heat the house in which they live.  They suffer great deprivation.  What level of supply will these people have?  These are people who simply cannot pay.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will have the power to turn down the water supply electronically.  What level of supply will they get?  Will they get 1 gallon, 10 gallons or 1 litre per day?  This will be a major question for the regulator because the issue will arise.  I know many people in this situation, such as constituents who do not have tomorrow's dinner.  They do not have breakfast for tomorrow morning.  How do the witnesses envisage this panning out?  What will be the level of reduction?  How much water will they get into their houses?<\/p><p> Impaired water quality is an issue.  The witnesses mentioned a reduction in the bill of 50% in cases where water is not fit for human consumption, and perhaps going beyond this reduction in cases of ongoing and continuous boil notices.  There is a problem with regard to hard water, which is where there is lime in the water.  In the part of the planet which I inhabit in the midlands there is a huge problem with regard to lime content in the water.  This is the case in Kildare, Laois, Offaly and other counties.  I have an expensive water softener in my house as do many of my neighbours.  Even with this we still have problems with electric gadgets being corroded and blocked.  People who cannot afford to put in a water softener are bedevilled with problems.  Do the witnesses envisage these people getting a reduction?  The water coming in is not of a quality which should be going into a house with regard to electrical appliances.  It costs hundreds of euro to deal with electric kettles, showers and washing machines and other appliances which are being destroyed.<\/p><p> With regard to projected increases, a &euro;240 average is envisaged for the first two years.  On the first day of a sale one always pitches good prices to attract the public.  This question is linked to that on the economic charge which I asked earlier and the witnesses may link the two for the purposes of answering.  What is the projected percentage increase over a three to five-year period?  Do the witnesses see it as being 5% or 10% a year?  What do they consider reasonable?<\/p><p> Tenants will be liable for water charges in private rented and local authority accommodation.  An issue will arises where a tenant cannot get a landlord to fix leaks in the pipes or the plumbing system, be it the local authority or a private landlord.  Hundreds of gallons would go through a small leak over a week or a month.  How will we address this?  Tenants tend to be a lower income group.<\/p><p> We do not have an out-of-hours service arrangement between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and six local authorities, including Laois County Council.  I stumbled across this because of a weekend emergency.  A problem which occurred on a bank holiday weekend could continue for 72 hours or longer without any emergency services.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann has tried to tell me and the public there were no emergency services prior to it taking over but there were and I have highlighted this.  I ask the witnesses to deal with this because it is a huge issue of concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100010#L01500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404234000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I am equally dubious about how the timeline has been completely thrown off by the lack of information from Irish Water.  The public is being deliberately kept in the dark.  This is the only conclusion we can draw.  The water charges are political dynamite as everybody who canvassed knows.<\/p><p>  CER states the average charge will not be more than &euro;240 on average.  From where does it get this figure?  OECD best practice for government services in general and water charges is full cost recovery.  This is what is in the document drawn up by the IMF and the previous Government.  Full cost recovery includes operational and capital costs.  The current cost of supplying non-domestic and domestic water is approximately &euro;1.2 billion.  As &euro;200 million is paid by the non-domestic sector I will work on the figure of &euro;1 billion.  A total of 1.48 million households are on the public water supply system with others on group water schemes.  If this is divided into &euro;1 billion the result is &euro;675.  Why does CER, the Government and Irish Water keep stating the average figure will be &euro;240?  I have seen water bills in Britain for more than &euro;600.  One can see them on Facebook.  People should be told what the real figure will be.  Why does CER operate on the lower figure?<\/p><p>  So-called allowances of water were trumpeted before the election, but now we read that what has been discovered is that children consume less water than was previously thought.  I do not know how one measures what a child consumes.  How does anyone know what a child consumes?  The meter records the use of the overall household.  The free allowance of 38,000 litres which was trumpeted has been thrown off course and it may be that people will have much higher bills.  What is the attitude of the witnesses on this?<\/p><p>  I understand the witnesses stating they will go with what the HSE or the Department of Health has to say with regard to health, but they also told us they are independent.  Why will they leave such an important matter to what is effectively the Government to decide?<\/p> <p>If people have serious health needs that require them to use much more water, will the independent regulator have a role in that regard?<\/p><p> When will people know the water charges they will have to pay?  I am still not clear how it will work.  Is Mr. McGowan saying each household must fill in a form, similar to a census, indicating to Irish Water who is living in that house?  It is not clear how that will be done.<\/p><p> Finally, as the energy regulator, Mr. McGowan might have a word with someone about the air conditioning level in here, which is ten times higher than necessary.  We are all freezing.

He also asked about the economic rate.  Deputy Coppinger asked how there can be full cost recovery and yet a charge of &euro;240.  Those questions are within the same ambit.  The Deputy is right.  There are three sources of revenue to Irish Water - non-domestic water charges, domestic water charges and Government subvention.  When taken together those three will equal the total revenue Irish Water will earn.  To be clear, as long as there is a level of Government subvention, the charges to customers will reflect that.  It stands to reason that if Government subvention falls, charges would rise to compensate for that, all other things being equal.  It is as straightforward as that.<\/p><p>  We have not done the analysis in terms of what the charges will be in the future.  We have been clear that we are looking at the first two years to the end of 2016.  That is our interim revenue control period.  As this is a new process it is important that we do not try to forecast too far forward.  We need to learn more about the dynamics of the water system.  We would expect our next price control would be a typical five or six year price control.  When we consult on that, probably in 2015 or 2016, there will be more information about the likely charges for the following five or six years.<\/p><p>  Deputy Stanley raised the issue of hard water, which was something that came back to us in terms of the responses we received.  Everybody acknowledges that in Ireland hard water is a fact of life for many people.  We have looked at other regimes.  Discounts do not typically apply for areas that have hard water.  Our focus is very much in terms of where a discount will apply where the water is not fit for human consumption.  That is the focus we are maintaining with regard to that entire area.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of the reduction in supply and customers who cannot pay or will not pay.  Ms Mannion may have more information in terms of what the outcome of a supply restriction may be but it is important to distinguish between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay, as we do in the energy sector.  In terms of people who cannot pay, Irish Water will have obligations to work with those customers to ensure that as far as possible, payment plans that can meet the requirements of the individual customer are put in place and that there are many payment options to ensure people have different means by which they can pay to allow them pay a little at a time on a regular basis or pay it off in lump sums.  It is important to distinguish between the cannot pay and the will not pay customers, as we do in the energy sector.<\/p><p>  I have covered the economic rate.  The Deputy asked about people who do not spend much time in the residence because they are in respite, they travel or whatever.  To be clear, this is about the primary residence.  If it is their primary residence and they are on a meter, effectively, they will be paying nothing if they are not in the residence because they will not consume water.

First, the CER is the economic regulator but the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the quality regulator.  The EPA has strong views, particularly on wastewater compliance.  A good deal of work has to be done for Ireland to comply with European directives.  Irish Water has published an investment plan for approximately &euro;2.7 billion.  Our consultants who reviewed that plan said that every one of those projects are needed but what we believe will happen, at least in the coming years, is that this &euro;2.7 billion is not enough to fund those and there will have to be some prioritisation as to what is the important scheme to do first and what to do second, third and fourth.

Obviously that is what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government set out in his water charges policy directive 2014.  The CER abided by that policy when looking at allowances and so on.  Ironically, affordability is nearly the biggest obstacle because the general public are concerned about their ability to pay for water.  A lot of people are seriously concerned about getting another bill in their door.  I shall add a point now that I was going to make later.  Whatever the amount, the liability or charge should not arise at the same time the local property tax is sought, and preferably it should not arrive on 1 January or just after Christmas.  I ask that because we must be sensitive to the fact that people are at the pin of their collars.<\/p><p>  There is general acceptance of the broad principles on which CER operates and creates a pricing model which includes conservation.  We should not waste water but it happens.  People have discussed rainwater harvesting and the use of treated water for toilets, etc.  We also know that we have a very poor pipe infrastructure.  It is amazing to think that in modern Ireland, particularly in large centres of population and business, there is no regular supply of water due to the standard of infrastructure.  It is only as the debate evolved that I realised that the problem was widespread and not just confined to my town in Mayo, and around County Mayo, but even in places located in the heart of Dublin.  The system is failing and we had no systemic way to reinvest in it.  Therefore, we appreciate that we need to invest in a structure because people want quality water and a proper water system.  <\/p><p>  I have an issue with a model that would pass on a cost, other than incidental costs, for the treatment of water and infrastructure set-up.  I refer to excess staff which is an issue that has been highlighted already.  Under service level agreements with local authorities, staff coming from the local authority water services department are excess to requirement.  However, Uisce &Eacute;ireann has estimated that it will require in the region of 1,700 staff and that means 4,300 staff will pass over under the service level agreements.  If one applies the rationale that only costs associated with the production of water, including capital infrastructure which can be phased out over a basis, then I think excess staff - which has been estimated to cost &euro;2 billion, up to 2026, when the service level agreements expire - should have no part in the CER's pricing of water.  That is my submission which I made to the Minister when he sought public consultation on his directive.  I do not think excess staff should be included in the price and it does not make sense to include them.  That is aside from the subvention issue which obviously involves other Departments such as the Department of Social Protection.  That model does not make sense.  We must bear in mind that in the future more cost will be borne by people and there will be less subvention.  That cost will become a very real factor, particularly at a time when there is less Government support, post-2016.  However, the measure has yet to be decided.  Does the CEO accept as reasonable and logical the premise that the cost of excess staff should be ring-fenced in terms of water pricing and removed from the equation?  The cost should not be included when the CER decides the price of water.<\/p><p>  Recently the head of Irish Water, Mr. John Tierney, issued a letter to local authorities.  Basically, he stalled the process of taking charge of housing estates which is long overdue in many cases.  With regards the great debate on parliamentarians versus the very local parochial and parish pump business, the fact is people come to us about lighting, footpaths, potholes and having no developer to resolve their problems.  We have cases where local authorities want to take charge of housing estates.  However, Mr. Tierney has said \"No, we have to develop a protocol\".  Irish Water did not mind installing meters outside people's houses in those estates.  Therefore, if there is a problem with the pipeworks then Irish Water needs to say it will take over the entire system.  It wants to charge and keep the money but offload any problems with the system on to the local authority or the residents of the estate, in some shape or form.  That idea must be knocked on its head and Irish Water asked to carry the can.<\/p><p>  Let me refer to the idea that Irish Water will not take over a problematic system of, for example, 100 houses in an estate where the developer has not installed the correct pipework.  Naturally, the developer, if in existence, should be held responsible and the local authority should be allowed to deal with the developer. <\/p> <p>The idea that Irish Water might contemplate not taking responsibility is unacceptable.  The other part of that letter indicated that in the case of cluster developments, which would be more relevant in rural areas where there may be a proprietary effluent treatment unit as opposed to a main sewer, it has no intention of taking over the pipework system and wastewater treatment system.  That is unacceptable.  If it is doing the job, which we are all heralding saying there are good points, these are the difficulties that have to be overcome.  It should take responsibility for the whole network, including the treatment plants and should not pick and choose.  It is taking money from people on the one hand for these services and yet is not responsible for them.  The shortcomings, whether in the wastewater treatment plan or the pipework, would not appear on a capital programme, whatever its priority.  At the outset, it is suggesting there will be no priority for these because it may not take them in charge.  That is wrong.  I mentioned flexibility and timing of bills.  Timing is very important.<\/p><p> The final point is one to which I think I know the answer.  It is not a new issue but it is one that is of concern to people, that is, the treatment of water, what goes into it and especially the fluoridation of water and safe water.  The issue of safe water was mentioned at the start.  Does the Commission for Energy Regulation have a view on the fluoridation of water or is it kicking it back to the Department of Health again?  It is an issue we have engaged with at times and we get that answer.  There are different views on it.  Given that people are being asked to pay for water it is important that there is a definitive view from the commission's point of view as it appears to be getting involved in all sorts of things, prioritisation, making sure there is a stable environment for investment and so on, bar affordability as was pointed out.

I will take the last question first, to which she has anticipated my answer.  Clearly it is not within our remit to offer advice on the health impact or otherwise of water fluoridation.  I am aware it has been a matter of public debate.  It is a matter for public debate and public policy but also Irish Water would have a voice in that debate and would, ultimately, comply with the outcome, whatever it was.  It would be outside the remit of the regulator to offer a view on that issue.  We would expect, if there was a clear policy on the issue, that Irish Water would comply with it in the most efficient way.<\/p><p>  The Deputy did not raise a question but made an opening remark around affordability.  Perhaps I should clarify.  Affordability measures are a matter for the Government.  Affordability is very much a matter for us in terms of our role as economic regulator.  It is our role to ensure that only the costs that are warranted and that are incurred efficiently pass through to the customer.  That is about affordability.  Therefore, we are concerned about affordability.  Once we have determined a reasonable economic level of revenue or charges we do not have a remit as to what particular targeted affordability measures may be put in place by Government.  Clearly that is a matter for Government.  I reassure the Deputy that we are concerned about the overall affordability of water and ensuring only efficiently incurred costs pass through to the customer.<\/p><p>  It is difficult for me to give the Deputy direct answers in respect of many of the questions she raised around the letter from John Tierney.  I can take it away and look at the particular issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1404235800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I mentioned affordability first.

We would not expect a situation where Irish Water would charge people for a service it does not deliver.  That is the first point.  We will have to come back to the Deputy on the second point, which was the adoption of schemes.  One can understand that there may be an issue whereby schemes have been put in place where, perhaps, there are concerns over the quality of the pipework and there is potential liability for rectifying inferior quality pipework.  One can understand that is an issue because in a socialised tariff, all that cost is borne by all customers when in fact it may be appropriate that the developer or somebody else would be forced to address that particular issue.  I will not give a definitive answer on that question until we have investigated it a little further.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the SLAs and costs.  We have not taken the costs under the SLAs and said that is fine, that is what Irish Water will get.  However, we have analysed Irish Water's costs - this will be in our publication - to determine the efficient level of costs.  We have to recognise from where Irish Water is starting.  All new utilities, where they have been established on the back of an existing local authority provision or an existing provision by some other means, have taken on board a particular cost structure, a particular set of circumstances.  The role of the economic regulator has been to state the utility's starting point, where it wants to get to, what is its glide path and what are the efficiencies we think it can achieve.  That is what we are looking at.  We are not looking at the SLAs and saying Irish Water has got those costs and that is it.  We are looking at its cost base and identifying what efficiencies we think it should make.  We expect Irish Water to achieve those efficiencies.  As stated previously, we note that there is a review under the SLAs after years two and seven.  That is the point where Irish Water needs to engage in terms of how those SLAs are structured, but we are not just taking SLAs and saying that those costs have to pass through to the Irish Water customer.  We are looking at these costs independently against the types of costs that have been incurred for similar services in other jurisdictions and by other water companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100014#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1404235800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>In a direct answer then, will the Commission for Energy Regulation disallow the cost of excess staff, which has been identified as being the case, who are coming under Irish Water?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100014#P00500","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404235800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Basically we are allowing Irish Water an efficient level of expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100014#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1404235800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>What is Mr. McGowan's view on it?

The service level agreements currently in place allow for a review after two years and another review after seven years.  The starting point with Irish Water is that it has these service level agreements with the staff and the staff are much needed to carry out the work.  We have to acknowledge that is the starting point.  As Mr. Paul McGowan has said, we have looked at its costs and, acknowledging that this is where it is starting from, we have put some efficiency measures in place for the first three years.  We plan to try for further efficiencies in place over that period in order that in the next review period, which will be six years after the end of 2016, we will probably seek harsher and more challenging reviews.  We have to acknowledge that the starting point is the service level agreements and the good job that people are doing with Irish Water.<\/p><p>  One other point was the suggestion that there should be some flexibility about the timing of billings to ensure they do not coincide with, say, the property tax.  That is a reasonable point.  We will speak to Irish Water to see if anything can be done to stagger these bills compared with, say, the property tax bills.  On the issue of affordability, we consulted our handbook which has two or three pages setting out the requirements placed on Irish Water before it even thinks about a notice of reduction of supply.   We have got many responses, particularly from organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which has asked us to strengthen it further.  We will do that.  We will strengthen our handbook and look at the flexibility of the payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100014#P00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1404235800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>On a final point on the service level agreements, I do not understand the point about the two or five year reviews.

There is no plan to make staff redundant.  In fact, the only way these excess staff will go is through natural wastage.

At the outset, I also welcome the fact that they agreed to return to the committee once the final submission of the Uisce &Eacute;ireann water charges plan has been made to them.  It is in the best interests of transparency and public debate on the charging plan.<\/p><p>  We are debating a new national utility that will manage a reformed water system.  No doubt the existing system has been identified as being a broken system.  It has been inconsistent in terms of the state of the network where it has been identified that over 40% of the water goes into the ground through leakage even though we spend more than &euro;1 billion per annum on it.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge CER's track record.  The only comparator is the electricity sector.  When CER was established in 1999, I would suggest that the electricity networks may have been inconsistent and substandard in many areas around the country.  Am I correct in assuming that CER will adopt a role with the objective of trying to achieve a consistent standard and quality of utility throughout the country, similar to that which it adopted when it took its role in the energy sector?<\/p><p>  Mr. McGowan stated that CER will not allow Irish Water to expend money inefficiency.  Does that apply to the set-up of Irish Water as well?  There has been much controversy around the moneys expended on the establishment of the national database and the asset management system for Irish Water.  Has he reviewed that?  Is that seen as a necessity and a good investment in terms of where Irish Water is starting?  It would be important to clarify that for the committee because there was much criticism and controversy around that.  I believe it is important as a benchmark or as a starting point.  One needs a properly audited oversight system or asset management system.  Mr. McGowan might clarify that point.<\/p><p>  Many areas I want to discuss have been covered and I will not go back over them.  I have three areas they might address.  One relates to the important customer charter or customer service obligations.  I note at the outset of the presentation that CER states one of its duties is to protect the interests of customers.  That is an important role and function of CER.  When it states that, the obvious objective is the protection of water standard and quality for the customer.  The three areas I would see as important are water pressure, water quality in terms of human consumption and water capacity.  The witnesses mentioned that the discounts that are envisaged will only apply where water is not fit for human consumption, but I would argue that where water pressure is not adequate, it is not fit for domestic use.  If, for example, there is only a dribble coming out of a tap, surely compensation or a discount should apply.  The same may be said of capacity.  If there is not enough water in a supply to service a domestic household adequately, surely there should be compensation for that household, such as a discount.  Is there room here for a graded discount system, from where water is not fit for human consumption to pressure, water quality, capacity and other issues?<\/p><p>  I understand similar standards apply in the customer charter for electricity supplies.  Is that a fair comparison?  Could the witnesses elaborate on that?  Where the customer is the focal point and if the quality of supply is not sufficient in the three areas I mentioned, surely there should be a compensatory element in the supply contract.  Will that be considered?<\/p><p>  The other area I want to touch on is mixed use and other unusual scenarios.  We will all be aware of the shared service supply where the supply is at the back of houses and for which CER will use an assessed means at present.  I am conscious of some places where there is not a public water supply but there is a connection to the public waste water system.  Given there is no meter, how is it envisaged that will be assessed?  Will it be looked at on the basis of the number of occupants in the house or how will that be worked out?  No doubt these scenarios will arise around the country.<\/p><p>  The third area I want to touch on is the capital investment priorities outlined by Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  CER may well have good intentions and priorities in this area, but I refer back to its duty to protect the interests of customers.  When I see that, I would contend that this involves the interests of all customers, both urban and rural.  While the priorities for Uisce &Eacute;ireann might be one matter, the public would depend on CER to ensure there is equality of delivery of capital investment throughout the country.  In other words, those in towns and villages who have a real need in terms of water should not be forgotten and CER has an important role as the regulator to ensure Uisce &Eacute;ireann's investment priorities look after those as much as the larger urban centres.  Perhaps Mr. McGowan would comment on that.<\/p><p>  Does CER have access to the asset management database that was mentioned earlier or does it depend on reports from Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  Does CER have independent access to such database?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100015#Q00400","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404236400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I will take the question on the comparison with the electricity system first.  I would agree with Deputy Coffey that we were in a similar situation when the CER was first formed, that there had been a lack of capital investment.  Possibly, it was not as bad as we see in the water system, but there certainly had been under-investment in the electricity system.  We must achieve a balance here.  Obviously, there are major investments needed.  We need to ensure the priorities are correct.  We, as the regulator, need to guard against any gold plating or persons building what is not absolutely necessary because there is a strong cost element to all of this and we want to ensure consumers are protected in those costs.<\/p><p>  We will try to have the same level of standard throughout the country in order that there is no sense of one place taking priority over another.  We will also need to factor in large industries where they come along.  Water provision, similar to electricity and gas provision, can be a major determinant for them coming into the country.  We will try to factor that in and ensure that is facilitated.  It is obviously important from a regional point of view and a national point of view that inward direct investment is not frustrated by a lack of water infrastructure.  In general, I would agree with the Deputy.  That is quite important and we will try to do that in as cost-effective a manner as possible.

The documentation we have put out is both an assessment of its capital costs for establishment and other capital investment and for its operating expenditure.  Members might recall that when we appeared before the joint committee previously, we had previously carried out an initial assessment.  This is a more robust assessment and I can reassure Deputy Coffey that it does extend to the establishment costs.  As to the particular point raised by the Deputy, in the first instance, we recognise there are properties which will have both services, that is, both water and wastewater, as well as those that will have only one service, that is, either water or wastewater.  For a wastewater-only service, it will be an assessed charge based on a self-declaration of occupancy because we will have no other means of assessment as, clearly, there will not be a meter and this will be the basis on which it will be done.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, does not have direct access to Irish Water's asset management systems as such but has the ability to require from that company whatever information, report or record we require to do our job.

Pressure is a complicated feature and, obviously, it has been highly variable across the country.  Low pressure has been a significant feature of water within the Irish system.  In some ways, that actually has been designed for in that, for most properties, the building standards specify that one will have a tank in a property.  The water pressure will vary significantly over the day and therefore at times of high pressure, one can fill the tank, which will cover against periods of low pressure for everything other than the direct means for consumption.  Consequently, going back historically, some elements of pressure have been built into the design of properties.  Pressure also is complicated in the sense that there is a relationship between pressure and the leakage in the system.  Obviously, if one jacks up the pressure in the system, one also increases the leaks and we must make sure there is a nuanced approach to pressure in order that it does not increase what already is a very high leakage rate, as the Deputy mentioned, in the system.  Overall, it is not so simple to even set a standard pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100016#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1404237000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Will there be a minimum pressure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070100016#R00400","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404237000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>These are the things we must work through over time.

Obviously, we wish to try to enhance the system's resilience in order that as we develop the system over time, the system will remain in place even when under duress, in the event of risks arising such as the big freeze in Northern Ireland that caused major havoc to the system there, a drought or a major infrastructural collapse.  It will take some time to make sure that we build up resilience to such risks within the design in the future but these are all areas we will consider.

That is the closest analogy but we also have wider statutory functions in the area of safety which do not extend to water.

In the case of the latter, we have a legal basis for resolving disputes and for dealing with customer complaints.  There was no legal basis in the water legislation for anyone to carry out that role.  Consequently, we have decided, on an agreement basis with Irish Water and the EPA, to put in place a process whereby if a customer rings Irish Water, he or she can immediately approach either the CER or the EPA to the extent that the complaint is not dealt with properly within Irish Water.  In short, we will put in place a harmonised approach between the three organisations to allow customers to have a single point of contact whenever they have a complaint.  Clearly, in the next round of legislation, we will seek the legal basis to do this because it always is second best to do it on an agreement basis, rather than having the legal rights.<br\/>As for our engagement with Irish Water to date, we have been working closely with the company for up to 18 months.  It started out by just getting to know each other and working out a way of working together in order that Irish Water knew what were our goals and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The culmination of all this work will take place tomorrow, when Irish Water makes its full submission to us.  As Mr. McGowan stated earlier, the last piece of work that had slowed up Irish Water was the need to conduct a market corporation test, which is very important because to get Irish Water off the Government's books, it must be fairly certain that it can pass this market corporation test.  Consequently, it took a little more time to make sure that it got that right, probably rightly so from its point of view because we cannot get that one wrong.<br\/>As for holiday homes, no, we had not thought of having a different small standing charge.  We are thinking of a single simple standing charge for all types of holiday homes because I suggest that in reality, the level of the charge, whatever it may be, will be much lower than the cost of providing the infrastructure to the property.  It is more just an additional contribution that we want the second house to make towards its cost because it will be using very little water during the course of the year and otherwise might be paying too little in total for the water.

The NTMA operates along private sector lines within a public sector environment managing a complex portfolio of financial and risk management businesses.  It was established in the first instance to manage the national debt because it was no longer possible to successfully manage that debt within the Department of Finance.  It is a hybrid model specifically designed to carry out commercial functions which could not be successfully performed within the traditional public service structure.<\/p><p>  The legislation which established the NTMA in 1990 expressly positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with the operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries.  The essential feature of the business model is that there are no general pay grades, no incremental pay scales and staff are employed on the basis of confidential individually negotiated contracts.  This business model was designed to enable the NTMA to compete with the private sector and attract and retain specialists in mid career who would not normally be attracted to working in a public sector environment.  The ability to attract and retain specialists in mid career has been the key ingredient in its success.  It has enabled the NTMA to quickly staff itself with the professional expertise necessary to carry out the new functions which Government awarded it over the years.  <\/p><p>  It has had to recruit for NAMA, the banking unit and NewERA over the past four years.  Its number have gone from 169 at the end of 2009 to 657 at the end of 2013, of whom 332 are working for NAMA.  It has had to pay market-competitive salaries to get these staff and salaries paid reflect the market.  The employment of staff recruited on the basis of specified purpose contracts lasts for as long as their specific function is required.  Indeed, some 16% of staff in the NTMA are employed on the basis of fixed-term or specified purpose contracts.  <\/p><p>  The Government has no plans to seek to alter the business model in this Bill.  One of the main reasons it is proposed to assign the new commercial functions contained in the Bill to the NTMA is its success in performing the commercial functions assigned to it and the flexibility offered by its business model.  A business of the size and complexity of the NTMA poses particular challenges and it is critical that the NTMA retains the ability to vigorously compete in the market to attract staff with the necessary skills to effectively manage the risks involved.  <\/p><p>  I note that the public service pension deduction and reductions in remuneration imposed by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 were applied to the NTMA.  Prior to the application of the provisions of the Act, members of the NTMA senior management team whose salaries exceeded &euro;200,000 had agreed to a 15% reduction in salary or such an amount of salary as exceeds &euro;200,00 if application of the full 15% reduction would bring their salary to below &euro;200,000 on foot of a request from the Minister for Finance.  <\/p><p>  The salary cap does not apply to the NTMA.  However, the Government would expect that the NTMA would only pay salaries in excess of the salary cap where it is clear that the market rate for the post in question requires such a level of remuneration if candidates of sufficient calibre are to be attracted to the post.  <\/p> <p>I can supply details of the salary band to the Chairman, but they have already been published in parliamentary questions and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA's accounts.  The NTMA can pay staff bonuses, but it is important to note that, in recent years, only a small number of contractual bonuses have been paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100008#J01600","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404240300,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but the question was not on bonuses.

However, here he is presiding over legislation that will set up new structures within the NTMA where there are no salary caps and where a bonus culture remains.  Although senior officials in the NTMA have waived their 60% or 80% bonuses in recent years, the legislation does not prevent the NTMA from providing bonuses.

The NTMA is one of the few agencies of the State that operates a bonus culture.  There is a need for a debate on whether that bonus culture is appropriate.  As I said earlier, staff have up to 80% of their wages available to them in the form of a bonus, as is the case in one contract of which we know from 2011.

Let us look at what the NTMA has done, not through its own willingness but through directed investment by previous Governments, and the current Government.  Substantial billions of euro of taxpayers' money, which previously was earning a return of 6% to 8%, was invested in the broken banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and others.  We are unlikely to see any return on that investment.  If we get a return on the capital sum we will be lucky.  <br\/>Under this section the Committee of Public Accounts is not allowed to question the chief executive in relation to any directed investment.  This is provided for in the subsection which, as I said earlier, states that the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.<br\/>I will give an example in relation to the National Pension Reserve Fund.  When I was elected to the Seanad in 2007 there was approximately &euro;23 billion in that fund.  There is only approximately &euro;6 billion in it now.  The remainder of it was invested in the banks.  Under this legislation the CEO of that fund cannot appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and express any view whatsoever on the merits of the policy which allowed approximately 80% of that fund to be whittled away by the decisions of previous Governments.  I believe that is lacking.  People who meet the criteria to be the CEO of an agency and are paid huge bonuses for doing their jobs should be able to give their expert opinion on whether a decision, direction or order was appropriate and met the needs of society, the economy and the agency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100011#N00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404241200,"counter":484,"content":"<p>This amendment seeks to delete new section 6A(2) of the NTMA Act which provides that the chief executive of the agency when appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts may not question or express an opinion on Government or ministerial policy.

In terms of the review carried out by the Department of Finance over a ten-year period one of the major issues identified was that alternative opinions should be published.  We should not be afraid of people criticising our policies because, in my view, that makes them stronger and more robust.  The issue here is that this is a multi-billion euro investment fund in respect of which the best experts in the country are employed to ensure it is managed and invested appropriately on behalf of this generation of Irish citizens and future generations.  A situation could arise whereby a school teacher, plumber, electrician and so on who is very popular in his or her constituency is successful in being elected to the D&aacute;il and, because his or her party is the largest party in Government, is appointed Minister for Finance and is allowed to direct the entire fund into a bust bank.  The person who is the expert in this regard and may have disagreed with the decision is not allowed to express an opinion on that decision.  I believe that is a serious issue.  The situation that could arise in this regard is different to that of policy directions.  This relates to an order or direction given to an investment fund.  I do not understand what would be so wrong with the CEO of the agency coming in here and saying that the Minister directed the agency to invest &euro;20 billion of the fund into a particular bank, that everyone knew it would never provide a return and despite that he or she and others argued at the time that it was a bad investment and could jeopardise X, Y or Z the decision was taken and that bank was then liquidated.

When a committee requests the chairperson or the chief executive of an agency to appear before it, it is custom and practice for him or her to attend.

We have acknowledged, in drafting the legislation, that we should not rely on custom and practice when it comes to the chairperson or the chief executive of the agency.

In my view the provision regarding disclosures of interests is appallingly weak.  It is up to the individual or member of the agency themselves, and this amendment is supposed to be directed towards members of the agency, not all staff.<\/p> <p>The member of the agency must identify the conflict of interest and it is up to him or her to raise it with the chairperson.  Should the chairperson think there is a conflict of interest, it is up to the chairperson to ask another member of the agency if he or she thinks the person is conflicted in relation to the subject matter.  Even if they do not do that and find they have contravened and are in breach under this section because they have influenced, taken a decision or been in the room when a decision was taken in relation to investment or otherwise, that must be reported to the Minister.  The Minister may decide to remove the member from the agency.  I think that is appallingly weak.  <\/p><p> The investment committee is investing our money.  It is pathetically weak that it would be up to a member of the investment committee in the course of the meeting to self-declare whether he or she feels conflicted.  Even if they did not - and this would be wrong - which they would be doing wrong, if they did not admit to being conflicted, that they could still remain in the position as a result of the legislation.  I believe that like every elected member in this room who must declare his or her interest in an open and transparent register of interests, although it has got its flaws because it only deals with assets and not liabilities, a member of the agency who is handling billions of euro of our funds should also have to declare his or her interests and complete an asset register or a register of declared interests.<\/p><p> This amendment calls for the agency to maintain a register of declared interests.

There are clear and specific disclosures of interest requirements in this legislation and the NTMA is also covered by the ethics in public office Act.  However members of staff of the agency are entitled to their privacy.  It would be going too far to have their personal affairs on view to the wider public and would be likely to serve as a significant disincentive to recruitment.

One can be on the investment committee but not a member of the agency.  It is about capturing those individuals and not the ordinary member of staff, although one could have a debate on why the member of staff would not be included.  In this debate, I am talking about the agency.  There is no appropriate mechanism in terms of recording conflicts of interest.  Let us take an example.  This is where past practice should teach us a lesson.<\/p><p>  We know the issues that arose in the glass bottle site in respect of accusations of conflict of interests.  We know about the interaction of Anglo Irish Bank and board directors that sat on both boards.  What we should have in terms of transparency to ensure that those issues are captured in real time and not four or five years later is that there is a register.  This legislation does not even allow for it to be contained within its annual report or some register \"that Mr. X had a declared interest in an investment and therefore absented himself from the proceedings on the issue, or Ms Y had a declared interest.\"  There is no register whatsoever being maintained.  It is noted in the minutes of the meeting and the minutes will not be publicised.  There is no transparency in relation to conflict of interests with board members and the desire of the public to be aware of those issues.<\/p><p>  Even when members contravene this legislation, which means they have not declared a conflict of interest, and means they were participants in the decision process that they had a conflict, the legislation does allow for them to be removed but allows also for them to remain in the position.  I think that is appallingly weak.  This area needs to be revisited.<\/p><p>  I am suggesting, but it needs finessing, that there should be a declared register of interests of agency staff, just as each member of the Oireachtas has to have a declared register of interests or at least the agency should maintain a registerer where people have identified themselves to be conflicted.  It is not proposed to hold a register, one would have to go through ever single minute of the agency and every single sub-committee for years on end to find out how many agency members over a period of ten years have acknowledged they were conflicted.  This makes for very bad corporate governance and also very poor accountability in my view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100015#R00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404243000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>In terms of normal company law and disclosure of a related party transactions and interests, would it not be automatically disclosed when the accounts are done?

If the Minister was so advised - I would trust a Minister absolutely, whether he or she was in a party or none to act appropriate in that regard - then not alone would the individual be subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act and a full investigation.  As we know, people have faced the court in respect of such issues.  I think there would be significant and serious penalties and from a career point of view, given the nature of the qualifications one would need to sit on those committees, it would have very significant adverse impacts also in business and in other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100015#R00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404243000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will refer to the glass bottle site, where there was a suggested conflict of interest.  This suggested conflict of interest was discussed at Oireachtas committee meetings, but it was discussed years after what happened.  People were involved in both areas at the same time.  I am not suggesting that something similar will happen here but the Minister is allowing for a situation where somebody would need to find out and then report them to the ethics committee.  The best way to prevent this happening is by having disclosure and if one is not making the information publicly available to have it available centrally within the agency.  The reason a Member of the Oireachtas has to declare his or her interests annually is because the public can go and say, \"I know such a Member is involved in that company but I look at the annual report and see he has invested the State assets heavily in the development of X, Y or Z , in which his partner is a shareholder or so on\".  Most of the disclosures that have come out in the past have not come out as a result of the great interrogation techniques of the Minister or the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>They have come to light because of people such as investigative journalists and ordinary members of the public.  If the agency does not hold a register and if it is not publicly available the power of people to examine these issues is taken away.  While they would be subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act and other laws, such as company law, it makes no difference unless they are found out first and foremost.  The legislation signals that someone who is in contravention of the Act is not automatically dismissed from the committee.  The legislation provides that if one is elected to Leitrim County Council, one is automatically off the agency.  It also provides that if one is conflicted and continues to be conflicted and do not inform anybody about one's confliction and continue to be involved in the decision where one is biased on this issue, one may still be able to serve on the agency.   If one gets elected to Leitrim County Council one is out on one's neck.  It makes no sense.  A terrible signal is being sent to people who may, for reasons right or wrong, be conflicted and hopefully the Minister will never have to examine the areas I am examining.  History tells us we have had rogues in Irish society and they may infiltrate the NTMA in years to come and may be involved in decision making that would be in contravention of the ethics register which means that somebody who would be associated with it would receive a benefit from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100015#R00600","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404243600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100016#S00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1404243600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I am interested to hear the reason the Minister of State believes that somebody who contravenes the legislation is not automatically dismissed as a member of the agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100016#S00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404243600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>It is clear from subsection (2) that the person must disclose to the agency, the investment committee or the committee concerned, the fact of his or her interest and its nature in advance of consideration of the matter.

Amendment No. 14 proposes to delete the lines relating to where the agency will make any proposals on the acquisition or disposal of any interests in a designated body.  As I mentioned earlier, this obviously relates to the privatisation of some of our State bodies.  We believe this is a Trojan horse that allows this take place in legislative form.<br\/>Amendment No. 15 would delete the Minister's power to ask the NTMA to manage the disposal of a State asset.  Section 19(3) states: <blockquote>The Agency shall, if a Minister of the Government who is a relevant Minister in relation to a designated body requests it to do so, provide project management services in relation to, or services consisting of overseeing - <br \/>(a) any acquisition or disposal of any interest in, or any assets of, the designated body, or <br \/>(b) any winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of the designated body<\/blockquote>The first part of this means that NewERA can provide advice to the Minister in regard to the disposal of any designated body and the second means the Minister can request NewERA to be the project manager of the disposal or winding up of any agency.  I believe it provides for this without any appropriate accountability.  <br\/>Amendment No. 16 inserts a provision to try to strengthen section 19(3)(b), because we know the Government is hell bent on facilitating the privatisation of some of our State assets.  In order to strengthen this subsection, we propose that &quot;any request from a Minister under this subsection requires the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot;<br\/>Amendment No. 18 is grouped with these amendments, but relates to section 20.  The amendment seeks to tie the hands of the Minister by requiring the Oireachtas to give prior approval to any move to sell off State assets, through the insertion of an addition to the subsection stating: &quot;and any request from a Minister under this subsection requires the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot;<br\/>Basically, our first two amendments, Nos. 14 and 15, try to ensure that the power does not exist to sell off our family silverware either through providing advice to do so or by allowing the Government outsource the sale to the agency, for example by asking it to get rid of Coillte or another body.

The common theme for these amendments is the involvement of NewERA in the acquisition or sale of State assets.  Amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 relate to the larger commercial semi-State bodies within NewERA's remit, while amendment No. 18 relates to other State bodies.  A State body is a body established under law and controlled directly or indirectly by a Minister.  The provisions the amendments seek to delete are either advisory, as in amendment No. 14, or ones which allow a Minister to ask NewERA to provide project management for or to oversee acquisitions or disposals of State assets, as in the case of amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 18.<\/p><p>  I recognise that some Opposition Deputies have strongly held views on the sale of State assets.  However, what is being proposed in this section is that Ministers have a source of dedicated corporate finance expertise available to them, both with regard to performance of their ongoing functions in regard to commercial State entities and with regard to any disposal or restructuring of such entities should the Government decide on such a restructuring or disposal.  NewERA is not being given any executive functions in this area.  These will remain a matter for Government.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate that Ministers should have the best possible commercial and financial advice available to them on all issues, including the acquisition or sale of assets.  Once the decision to acquire or sell assets is made, Ministers should equally be able to use the expertise available.  This is purely a mechanism for carrying out what would generally have to be a decision of the Oireachtas in the first place.  Amendment No. 18 would require the Houses of the Oireachtas to approve a request to NewERA to be involved in the sale or acquisition of any interest in or assets of a State body that is not a designated body.  I do not see the point of requiring separate approval for what would require an Oireachtas decision in the first place.<\/p><p>  I would like to make clear that the provisions in regard to project management and oversight do not concern the actual underlying Government decision about the sale or restructuring of a State asset.  Rather, it means that once such a decision is made, Ministers may avail of the expertise in NewERA in implementing the Government decision - once that decision has been endorsed by the Oireachtas.  This is purely an enabling provision.  The Government reserves the right to propose what should be done with State assets and it is only sensible that once such a decision is made, the decision is implemented as efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100017#T01000","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404244200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State go back over the part dealing with amendments Nos. 16 and 18, where the approval of the House of the Oireachtas is required in the first instance anyway?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100017#T01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404244200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want me to read it all again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100017#T01200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404244200,"counter":580,"content":"<p>No, just the relevant part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100017#T01300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404244200,"counter":581,"content":"<p>First, NewERA is not being given any executive functions.

The reason it was not debated in the Houses of Oireachtas, when it was issued on three different occasions, was that there was no requirement for the Minister to seek prior approval for such a thing.  The Minister may say it is implicit that the Minister needs Oireachtas approval.  The point is that this legislation allows for a Minister to give a direction.  We discussed this earlier in my amendment.  I said that a direction should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that it could be annulled within 21 days.  The Minister argued that a direction should not have that power and that it should only be an order because directions would be day-to-day issues.<\/p><p>  In section 19, one can actually see that a direction and not an order will given to the agency to dispose of a State asset.  It actually states that the agency shall comply with any such directions, so it is not just saying that one would like it to go down that road.  This is very clear.  While section 19(7) states that the direction must be published, the ability to annul the direction is not there.  This is very serious.  A Minister, without any recourse to the Houses of the Oireachtas, can give a direction to sell off a State asset.  It does not require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Does the Minister of State have nothing to say to that?  Does he believe the Minister should have that power?

In the first instance, a direction will be issued after due consideration and consultation.  It will not, therefore, be either arbitrary or random.  In addition, it must be published as soon as is reasonably possible.  The proposed amendment could require the publication of commercially sensitive information relating, for example, to corporate strategy and investment plans or - with due respect to the views underlying the amendment - the sale or acquisition of assets.  In such cases, commercially sensitive information may have to be redacted until it is no longer commercially sensitive.

The first relates to timely publication, the second - which arises on foot of the Minister of State's reply - to the content of the direction and the third to the forum in which the direction is published.  Let us deal first with timely publication.  There is no stipulation in the section in the context of what period of time is appropriate.  Some reports from semi-State bodies, etc., that are to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas can be delayed substantially.  It is appropriate, therefore, that a direction from the Minister - which could have a long-term consequences, a matter we dealt earlier - should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or at least published within a week.  If the Minister is of the view that a week is too restrictive, then we could consider extending the period to two, three or four weeks.  In my view, however, it should not be left open-ended.  The section does not make reference to a timeframe.  All it states is that the direction should be published as \"soon as is reasonably practicable\".  A timeframe of some form should be put in place.<\/p><p>  On the content of what is to be published, the section states \"the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform shall publish the direction in such manner as he or she considers appropriate\".  This leads me to expect that directions will be published.  I interpret the phrase \"in such a manner as he or she considers appropriate\" as meaning how he or she wants to publish.  I do not believe it relates to the content of the direction.  Does the phrase \"in the manner\" mean that a direction can be edited or partly redacted for publication?  If that is the case, I am surprised.  Even if that is how the Government wants it in order to protect commercial sensitivities, the final issue relates to the forum in which the direction is published and I am of the opinion that should be the Houses of the Oireachtas because it would allow us to debate any issues which might arise.<\/p><p>  Publishing something can also mean burying it on a website.  Ministers and Ministers of State have used such tricks in the past.  Something can be placed on a website and no one will know it is there.  In recent days I asked the Minister for Finance about bankers' remuneration but I kept hitting my head against a brick wall.  I asked a specific question in which I requested that the Minister not refer back to the Mercer report and he informed me that the information I was seeking is now available on the websites of AIB and Permanent TSB.  That information was placed on those websites because the Minister, in light of the question I had tabled, asked the banks in question to see to it that this was done.  Very few people visit websites in order to discover information about the remuneration of bankers.  It is possible, therefore, to publish information but also bury it at the same time.<\/p> <p>These directions should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a reasonable timeframe.

Our social housing provision is at a crisis point, with more than 100,000 people on housing waiting lists throughout the country and, in certain counties, people waiting weeks or months to get on housing lists.  Given that the Department of Social Protection pays approximately &euro;500 million per year in rent allowance, it is very important we direct some of the money into the provision of social houses.  We would be creating assets and would be able to reap a dividend by way of the differential rent system.  Instead of spending &euro;500 million per year of taxpayers' money in rent allowances, we should provide our own housing stock.<br\/>This issue has received particular attention in recent weeks by way of Private Members' business and the housing Bill that has come before the D&aacute;il.  Many Deputies from constituencies throughout the country have continually raised the need for greater investment in social housing.  The amendment requests that the fund would be used for the provision of social housing.<\/p> <p>We are getting an asset but it is labour intensive.  People most adversely affected by the recent downturn - tradesmen, block layers and labourers - are coming back into the workplace.<\/p><p> People will not accept this if the investment focuses on the east coast, on Dublin and its commuter belt areas.  We want balanced regional development, with each area getting its fair share of investment to ensure we create jobs, not just in the areas of high population density but also further west.  That is why my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, put forward these two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100024#CC01700","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404248400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 21 would mean the agency acting as NewERA would be able to develop proposals for investment in social housing in addition to the sectors of energy, water, communications and forestry already set out.  The sectors I have listed are those in which the large commercial semi-State bodies on which NewERA advises operate and in which NewERA will have expertise.  I note that the section provides that the Minister for Finance may specify other sectors by order.<\/p><p>  With regard to social housing, the Government is exploring all avenues to ensure the supply of housing is maximised.  According to the recently published construction strategy, it is a key goal of the Government that every citizen has access to suitable housing.  The Government continues to prioritise the delivery of good quality social housing, including the return to mainstream local authority housing construction this year, enhancing the role of the not-for-profit sector in the provision of social homes and continuing to work with NAMA, local authorities and approved housing bodies to maximise delivery of units owned by NAMA or its debtors for social housing.  We will identify the best ways to deliver social housing for the years ahead through the development of a comprehensive strategy for social housing.  It is estimated that up to 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes.  This includes completion of mortgage-to-rent arrangements, the continued transfer of units owned by NAMA or its debtors, completion of existing building and acquisition programmes and transfers under the rental accommodation scheme.<\/p><p>  Budget 2014 contained innovative housing measures and announced an additional &euro;30 million investment in local authority housing which is expected to provide a substantial number of new and refurbished homes.  Almost half of the investment would enable the construction of new infill developments in areas with the highest demand.  In March, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, launched a two-year &euro;68 million local authority home building initiative which would build 449 new social homes.  This investment represents the first return to new mainstream local authority housing since the beginning of the crisis.<\/p><p>  Details of the &euro;15 million fund to bring vacant local authority houses back into use were announced in April.  This will bring 952 vacant local authority units back into use providing high-quality homes for people in need of housing while also providing employment through labour-intensive activity.  This year will also see the completion of a three-year &euro;100 million investment that will provide 800 units for older people, people with disability or people without a home.  We are in the process of rolling out a new housing assistance payment which, in addition to helping remove barriers to employment for recipients, will contribute to the creation of a higher quality private rental sector.  The contribution of the not-for-profit sector will be facilitated by introducing legislation to regulate the sector.  Regulation will enhance the ability of approved housing bodies to attract private finance.<\/p><p>  The construction strategy states that later this year we will publish a social housing strategy setting out our vision and will introduce legislation to regulate the approved housing body sector.  I have already noted that the investment sectors in which NewERA will operate are those in which it already has expertise.  Social housing is not one of those areas.  A role in social housing may be more suitable to other areas of the NTMA family, for example, NAMA has co-operated actively with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and with the Housing Agency in seeking to match the residential stock controlled by its debtors and receivers with the requirements for social housing.  It remains open to the Minister to prescribe social housing as an area in which NewERA can develop investment proposals if he forms the view that doing so would help achieve the Government&rsquo;s target.<\/p><p>  I do not propose to accept this amendment but in regard to amendment No. 22, I have indicated in my response to amendment No. 20 that the Minister is considering an amendment on Report Stage on how the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund reports on its investments and we will consider amendment No. 22 in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100025#DD00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404248400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the sub-committee and have no right to table amendments but I am here to raise several issues to be dealt with in a substantive way in order that I can table amendments on Report Stage.  The Minister of State gave a long reply and dealt with the Government&rsquo;s inadequate policy on social housing.  Only in the last few sentences did he relate it to what might come under this Bill.  I strongly support the idea that the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be used for productive investment in public infrastructure and so forth.  I am highly suspicious of this Government's  motivation with regard to this Bill.  The proposals for investment outlined in section 22 coincidentally are those in which private big business and multinational corporations also have a huge interest.  The thrust of this Government is towards privatisation, so-called joint ventures, etc. which are ways of diluting public ownership and moving to sell parts or all of crucial infrastructure to multinational capitalists.<\/p><p>  Section 42 increases my suspicion because it states very specifically that more of the pension fund can be put into saving banks but the Minister of State makes no such explicit provision for our greatest infrastructural need, social and affordable homes for the people.  He read a long reply on different aspects of Government policy which are intended to deliver a totally inadequate number of homes for people in desperate need but none relates to what would be possible under this Bill if the Government was seriously committed to public investment in social and affordable homes.  It should be a prime candidate for investment from the pension funds that are moving over.  It is one of the greatest social needs.  The construction of homes is also an area that is highly labour intensive, and one in which, unfortunately, there is a large reservoir of unemployed skills.  Skilled workers have gone overseas who could come back.  These workers are desperately looking for homes.  In a short time, if the will existed, a substantial programme of public investment in social and affordable homes could be put in place throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund should be directed to this work.  If this Government were serious about resolving the crisis and ending the suffering, it would make of this a key project that would stand for all time, defining what a Government could do, but that is not proposed in any sense.  It is mealy-mouthed in the extreme.<\/p> <p>In his reply on Second Stage the Minister of State made a small reference to the points raised by many Deputies on the need for social housing and a fund like this to be used for that purpose.  Nowhere in the Bill is there any indication whatsoever that we might be moving in that direction.  Any Deputy who is in touch with his or her constituents has known for a long time the extent of this crisis.  The Bill that has just gone through the D&aacute;il is a scandal, its only purpose being to remove 90,000 households from local authority lists through the trickery that is the housing assistance payment, HAP, programme.  It will not resolve anything.<\/p><p> I am asking the Minister of State to come back on Report Stage with clear proposals to address this issue.  It is, unfortunately, true that much of the expertise that formerly was available within the local authorities has been lost.  In the 1970s, for example, many of them were building 7,000 or 8,000 houses a year.  These days, some of them have not built any for a long time.  Of course, it is the case that expertise has been lost and needs to be reassembled very quickly.  Will the Minister of State come forward on Report Stage with a comprehensive proposal on what is possible in this field?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100025#DD00300","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404249000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I am not entirely clear on what is envisaged under this section, specifically in respect of NewERA.

People are being told by landlords that their rents are increasing by 20% or 30%.  If they do not pay, they have to go.  They are being housed in hotels.

The original stipulation is to support economic activity and employment in the State and I wish to widen its scope to also &quot;provide for an important public need, to improve public services essential to the operation of the economy or to carry out an essential social or environmental action&quot;.  This goes back to the debate that flowed earlier on being able to invest in social housing without having it completely privatised and profitable.  As for the type of structure one must create to so do, I acknowledge it must be kept off the balance sheet anyway but it need not necessarily be as rigid as what is provided for at present.  Moreover, the amendment specifies that the public need is an important area that should be identified, as should social services and environmental action.<br\/>As for amendment No. 32, section 39 deals with securing interest rates, the level of risks and so on to which the agency must have regard in respect of its investment.  Sinn F&eacute;in argues in this amendment that the broader economic, social and environmental impacts also should be taken into consideration.  A question has arisen down through the years as to where the resources have been invested and in the context of the NTMA, it would have arisen in respect of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  One could have, for example, investments being made that are commercially sound but which ethically do not keep in line with the majority wishes of the public or indeed the Government or the Oireachtas.  I do not refer to cases in which decisions to invest were based on personal friendships but about the idea of investing in nuclear energy, the arms industry and so on.  There were cases in the past, when the fund was dealing with such commercial stuff, in which those areas would have applied.  Consequently, the purpose of this amendment is to widen the scope in order that it is not simply about securing rates or the risks of the assets, which I acknowledge are crucially important.  However, it also should be about the broader social and environmental impact, which would widen its scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100029#HH02900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404250800,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 31 is self-explanatory and is about ensuring that opportunities are created for those who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months, as well for those under the age of 25 who are unemployed.

The same is true if the ISIF were to seek rates of return adjusted to take into account the broader economic, social and environmental impact.  ISIF's commercial mandate is also important to put the fund in a position to leverage its resources by attracting private sector co-investment, recycle its resources in order to make more strategic investment over time and ensure that the public assets entrusted to the fund are not frittered away.<\/p><p>  To the extent that there are commercial investment opportunities that support economic activity and employment and also provide an important need or have a desirable social or environmental impact, the ISIF will be able to invest.

I am satisfied on the one hand that there is no need to amend the Bill, as suggested in amendments Nos. 30 and 32, because the fund can be invested in such areas if commercial investments emerge.

Such indemnities or guarantees have been essential in recent years to secure funding for projects from international financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank, where a sub-sovereign entity, such as the National Roads Authority, is procuring that project.  A ministerial guarantee may also be required to ensure an appropriate credit rating for a PPP in such cases.<br\/>The purpose of the proposed amendment is to provide a legislative basis where a Minister issues a letter of indemnity for or guarantees to fund PPP companies or PPP projects.  The office of the Attorney General has indicated that such a provision is appropriate if the practice of Ministers issuing such letters is to continue.  The provision formalises an implicit State liability because a Minister providing the guarantee will generally be funding the State authority through the departmental Vote.  In the case of roads, for example, it is simply the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport vouching that he will be liable for the payment of obligations of the NRA should the NRA fail to pay, as per the terms of the PPP.  In simple terms, the Minister is vouching that he or she will make the payments to the NRA that he or she would be making anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100034#NN03200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404253500,"counter":879,"content":"<p>What of amendment No. 47?

It arises from a request by the NTMA to be allowed to collect and use a customer's PPSN and to use the associated public service card for the purpose of administering the State savings products - savings certificates, savings bonds, national instalment savings, national solidarity bonds and deposit accounts.  The NTMA proposes to use the PPSN as a unique identifier for the holders of State savings products and to use the public service card to authenticate identity and facilitate certain types of transactions in respect of State savings products.  They are concerned to have such a system of unique identifiers for their customers, not only for efficient record-keeping but also because there are statutory limits on individual holdings of certain State savings products and requirements to be able to identify individuals for the purpose of the EU savings directive and anti-money laundering rules.   The alternative of creating a stand-alone system of unique identification would be inefficient in that it would duplicate the existing arrangements which use the PPSN as the unique identifier and would be costly and a waste of money to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p> The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 envisages the PPSN being used by numerous bodies other than the Department of Social Protection.  For example, the RSA is a specified body in Schedule 5 of the 2005 Act as the PPSN and associated information is relevant to its driving licence functions.  Access to PPSNs has also been extended to a number of public bodies and credit institutions under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 for the purposes of its provisions.  It is proposed, therefore, to amend Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to include the NTMA as a specified body for the purposes of that legislation.<\/p><p> Amendment of the Long Title of the Bill is required by way of amendment No. 53 to take account of the amendments to the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002 and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provided for in amendments Nos. 46 and 47.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070100034#NN03400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404254100,"counter":882,"content":"<p>It is the intention of the NTMA to use PPS numbers with prize bonds.

We are involved in the retail pharmacy sector that people see in every town, village and community.  Our mission is to promote the professional and economic interests of our members.  Community pharmacists in Ireland are highly trained health care professionals and extremely accessible to the general public.  Some 85 million individual visits are made by citizens, consumers and patients, to Irish pharmacies every year.<\/p><p>  As a result of the increasing demand for health services and the shrinking resources in the sector, the health system is under unprecedented pressure.  It is near breaking point in many respects.  Hospitals are overstretched and general practitioners are struggling with their existing workloads.  According to GPs, their workload will increase dramatically with the introduction of universal health care and universal access to GP care.  The current shortage of GPs is unlikely to be solved in the short term, given that over 1,000 Irish-trained GPs have taken up work in the UK health service since 2009.  As the population of Ireland grows and ages, there will be additional pressure on the health care service.<\/p><p>  Similar problems have been experienced in other countries and solutions have been found.  When demand for GP services exceeded the available capacity in England, Scotland and Canada, the unique skills and expertise of pharmacists were used to enhance access to health care.  At the beginning of the year the UK Royal College of General Practice and the College of Emergency Medicine, both of which are based in London, estimated that one in seven GP visits in the United Kingdom - equating to 51 million visits annually - and one in 12 attendances at accident and emergency departments could be dealt with by pharmacists, the health professionals best placed to offer advice and treatment for minor ailments.  Based on these statistics, the implementation of a pharmacy-based minor ailments scheme in Ireland could ease the pressure on GP services sufficiently to allow GPs to provide the additional 4 million consultations which they have estimated will result from the roll-out of free GP care.<\/p><p>  Our proposals are not just based on alleviating the workload of GPs because patients would benefit, too.  According to data from Scotland, in-depth medicine use reviews conducted by pharmacists with patients suffering from chronic illnesses who were taking a multitude of medications reduced hospital readmission rates by one third.  In Canada the scope of practice of pharmacists has been extended to include chronic disease management.  This involves monitoring the condition of patients with chronic illnesses; renewing and adjusting their prescriptions, where appropriate, to ensure tighter control of their symptoms; and delivering better treatment outcomes.  The extension of pharmacist services in these countries, in response to the shortage of GPs, has resulted in better access to health care and substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality rates from illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.<\/p><p>  Irish pharmacists have successfully introduced a pharmacy-based flu vaccination service in the last three winters.  This has shown that pharmacists have the ability to deliver professional health care services outside what might be considered usual pharmacy services.  Evidence for the benefits of the improved convenience and accessibility pharmacists provide is seen in the fact that 24% of people vaccinated in a pharmacy had never availed of the flu vaccine previously, even though 85% of them were in an at-risk category.  The number of flu vaccinations carried out in community pharmacies doubled between the winter of 2010-11 and the winter of 2011-12 and doubled again between that winter and last winter.  More and more patients are seeing convenience as a key driver of vaccinations.<\/p><p>  At the beginning of Lent this year the IPU, through its member pharmacies, introduced a smoking cessation service, which was launched by the Minister for Health.  This service has been broadly welcomed as making a significant contribution towards the ultimate goal of achieving a tobacco-free Ireland.  Public surveys have shown that pharmacists rank second only to nurses as the health care professionals most trusted by the public.  Despite this, Ireland, unfortunately, continues to lag behind other countries when it comes to allowing pharmacists to offer the additional services people want.  Irish pharmacists are willing, ready and able to help to alleviate pressure on GP surgeries and hospitals by providing a broader range of health care services for patients and the public, in line with what is happening in other countries.  Nobody is trying to reinvent the wheel.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to two specific services that could be introduced quite easily and which would be of immediate benefit to patients and the State.  The primary aim of a minor ailments scheme would be to allow medical card patients to receive treatment for common ailments free of charge directly from their local community pharmacies.  Such a scheme would be cost-neutral to the Exchequer because these patients are already entitled to receive prescribed medicines free of charge with their medical cards.  Community pharmacists deal every day with minor ailments as part of their normal practice.  They give advice to people on how to treat self-limiting conditions.  They work with the public to distinguish between minor ailments and illnesses that have the potential to be more serious.  They recommend effective treatments that can be secured without a prescription.  As a result, they help to play a role in keeping these minor ailments out of the GP surgery.  Furthermore, they refer to GPs, where appropriate.  If a medical card patient wants to access a non-prescription medicine for a minor ailment, he or she has to go to the GP to get a prescription.  The proposed minor ailment scheme would allow medical card patients to access non-prescription medicines directly from pharmacists without the need to go to the doctor.<\/p><p>  The IPU strongly welcomes the recent announcement by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, formerly known as the Irish Medicines Board, that it has drawn up a list of 12 medicines which should be switched from prescription-only to non-prescription status.  This will increase the options for patients and consumers in managing their health care with the advice and support of their pharmacists.  We hope to see the list published within the next two weeks.  The implementation of a national minor ailments scheme, using that list as well as existing non-prescription medicines, would benefit patients by providing greater and easier access to health care.  It would benefit the health service by targeting resources at where they are needed and would benefit GPs by freeing up their time to deal with patients who have more serious or chronic illnesses that require GP time.<\/p><p>  The second service we are proposing is a medicine use review service which would be useful in assessing people's compliance with their medication regimes and improving their medicine-taking through concordance.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children recommended in its report on the adverse side effects of pharmaceuticals that the role of the pharmacist in community health should be expanded and provision should be made for regular medication reviews for all patients.  International evidence confirms that the introduction of medicine use reviews provided by pharmacists has improved health outcomes, enhanced quality of life and reduced the requirement for hospital care.<\/p> <p>The objective of any review of the use of medicines and expenditure on medicines must be to ensure better outcomes for patients and maximise value for money.  The introduction of a medicines use review service delivered through community pharmacy delivers on both of these objectives.<\/p><p> Medicines use reviews are an advanced pharmacy service in England and Scotland and their benefits are evident.  As I indicated, the medicines use reviews conducted by pharmacists in Scotland with elderly patients who take multiple medicines have reduced hospital readmission rates by more than 30%, resulting in significant improvements in quality of life for the individuals in question and dramatic savings in the cost of their health care.  Similar services are also available in pharmacies in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.  <\/p><p> In addition to the two services I have described, which could be implemented most easily because they do not require regulatory or legislative change, the role of pharmacists in providing health checks, health promotions and vaccinations could be expanded.  As I stated, given that pharmacists provide vaccinations against influenza, there is no reason they should not be permitted to provide other vaccinations, where appropriate.  Other services that could be provided by pharmacists include new medicine services, which would involve assisting people who are starting on a new medicine for a chronic condition to understand the medicine, obtain the best outcome from it and ensure they take it; chronic disease management, which would involve working as part of a multidisciplinary team or in collaboration with a patient's general practitioner and other health care professionals to help the person to manage his or her chronic illnesses; anti-coagulation services, which would plug a significant gap whereby people who are on warfarin and other anti-coagulant drugs do not have access to appropriate monitoring facilities in large parts of the country; monitored dosage system services to enhance concordance with medication; and a dispose of unused medicines properly, DUMP, scheme, which is a way of getting unnecessary and unused medication out of homes.  Allowing pharmacies to provide these services would improve access to professional health care; reduce overall Exchequer spending on health care; ease some of the existing burden on general practitioner services, thus freeing up crucial resources; and improve health outcomes for patients and members of the public.<\/p><p> I propose to raise a couple of regulatory and other issues.  Pharmacy registration fees in Ireland are the highest in Europe and possibly the world.  Pharmacists' income has been cut repeatedly through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act and other Government initiatives.  Despite the publication some years ago of a Forf&aacute;s report on regulatory costs which recommended a review of Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, registration fees for pharmacies, fees remain at excessively high levels and far out of line with other countries.  They are, for example, almost ten times higher than equivalent fees in the United Kingdom.  It is, therefore, high time this issue was tackled.  <\/p><p> Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the regulator of pharmacists and pharmacists, has fitness to practise and regulatory responsibilities.  Pharmacists are frequently prosecuted before the District Court for the same breaches of regulation for which they have faced internal fitness to practise proceedings, even in the case of technical breaches where there is no risk to patient safety.  In addition, in less serious cases, when the fitness to practise process has concluded and a pharmacist has been sanctioned by way of admonishment or censure, the outcome is published on the website of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  There does not appear to be a time limit on the period for which a notice remains on the website, which means, in effect, that the punishment is open-ended and, as such, unjust and inequitable.  The Pharmacy Act has been place for almost seven years and the fitness to practise process for the past five years.  This is an opportune time to assess the manner in which the Act is being implemented, in particular the fitness to practise provisions, to ensure the system is fair, equitable, transparent, efficient and cost-effective. <\/p><p> Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland may not register a pharmacist who is an undischarged bankrupt.  In response to questions from members of this committee - the IPU is grateful to the joint committee for the interest it has taken in this issue - the Minister stated that amendments to the Act, including an amendment to the relevant section, are being examined and will be considered for inclusion as part of any future amendments to the Act.  However, given the increasing incidence of personal insolvency among all sectors of society, it is high time an amendment was introduced to allow an insolvent pharmacist to continue to practise his or her profession and earn a living.  We ask that the joint committee keep this matter on the agenda until it has been resolved and the Act amended.  <\/p><p> It is our intention, as a profession, to propose positive solutions to some of the problems and deficiencies in the health system, with a view to providing accessible, convenient and cost-effective health care services for patients and members of the public and, where possible, relieving pressure on other parts of the health care system.<\/p><p> I thank members again for their time and attention and for giving us the opportunity to outline briefly some of the services that could contribute to alleviating the pressure on the health service and improving the delivery of health care.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to answer any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404232200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>In the absence of Deputies Billy Kelleher and Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, whose apologies are noted, as is the presence of Deputy Sandra McLellan, I ask Senator John Crown to contribute first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>Our strange health care pie has many ingredients.

In addition, every doctor will have had occasion to be grateful to a pharmacist for spotting a mistake in a prescription and thereby avoiding something bad happening.  Pharmacy provides a tremendous back-stop service.<\/p><p>  We need to take a radical new look at the way in which health care is delivered.  It is not a question of reform but a much more fundamental change, whether a re-engineering or perhaps even a revolution.  I am not sure what is the correct way to describe what we need to do to deliver health care in this century.  <\/p><p>  It is suggested that the role of the pharmacist be expanded from one where he or she often follows directions provided by a doctor for the safe dispensation and prescribing of medicines to one where he or she makes more independent clinical decisions.  Will this require a fundamental change in the way in which we educate pharmacists?  Will it require a new generation of pharmacists with a fundamentally different skill set from the existing generation or is it possible, with the existing skill set, to adapt work practices in a safe direction?  I am not arguing for one option or another as I honestly do not have the answer.  <\/p><p> Pharmacy, like the travel, newspaper and music retail industries, is undergoing a fundamental change, driven partly by technology and partly by modern management practice.

The system is about carefully monitoring what drugs people are on.  Does the Irish Pharmacy Union consider it has a part to play in promoting that idea in order to give protection to the pharmacist on the one hand, and to provide protection to the card holder on the other?

That it is such a superb service is the reason we should be rolling out all the other initiatives he has suggested not only today but previously.  As a committee, we have had conversations with the HSE and the director who is responsible for this area.   The HSE views all the services he has proposed as wonderful and cannot wait to sit down to discuss them with him with a view to putting them in place.  What is happening with the negotiations?  Has he discussed any of the ten items on his proposed recommendation agenda today?  Has he discussed pharmacy fees, given that the representative body has large amounts of money in the bank and does not necessary need to maintain the fees?  Has any move been made on that issue?  The last time we spoke, the only two types of professional who could not continue to practise once they had been declared bankrupt were politicians and pharmacists.  We have managed to sort out the politicians' side.  Is there any real movement on a drafting of an amendment to the Act?  What has happened since the last time we discussed this issue?  I hope I will not be told that nothing has happened, but please enlighten me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E00300","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232800,"counter":939,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, what was it that I said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E00500","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232800,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator Crown to speak again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232800,"counter":941,"content":"<p>The Senator said the service was a limping service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E00700","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1404232800,"counter":942,"content":"<p>The health service is a limping service, not the pharmacy service.

I have a couple of follow-on questions from those raised by Deputy Regina Doherty and Senator Colm Burke.  Unfortunately, there has been a huge increase in polydrug use and the abuse of prescription drugs.  Given that the street value of benzodiazepines, known as \"benzos\", is quite high and that it is common for people to be addicted and to abuse such prescribed medications, is there a system in place whereby pharmacies dispensing the medication can talk to each other in case a person gets multiple prescriptions from GPs?  I am aware that a report was commissioned by the Department on prescribing patterns.  We all have anecdotal evidence of certain parts of the city or the country where benzos are prescribed more often than in others.  Perhaps the witnesses would speak about that issue.<\/p><p>  In the past couple of years, pharmacists have been able to dispense emergency contraception, known as the morning-after pill, for which there appears to be a huge variance in price, ranging from &euro;9 to &euro;45.  The Union of Students in Ireland currently has a lobby on this issue, although it has limited funds.  This may link in with the minor ailments scheme.  A student or young person in need of the emergency pill cannot get it on her medical card but must go to her doctor for a prescription.  For me, that defies the whole logic of being able to walk into a community pharmacy, as there issues that may surround the emergency pill for such young women in terms of stigma.  In Portugal emergency contraception is free, in the UK it costs &euro;7, and in Belgium it costs &euro;15.  In Ireland there appears to be a huge variation, with prices ranging from &euro;9 to &euro;45 for the emergency contraceptive pill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E01000","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404232800,"counter":944,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been raised.  I will not field them all but will invite my colleagues to respond.<\/p><p>  I can start with Senator Crown's questions.  I acknowledge and thank him for his observation that pharmacy acts as effectively a band-aid on a limping health service.  His question was around whether we need to re-engineer pharmacy education and training to provide pharmacists with the skills to take on the new roles being discussed.  The education and training of pharmacists in Ireland has actually evolved dramatically in the course of the past decade.  It is 20 years since I qualified as a pharmacist.  If I were to start in first year in any of the three pharmacy schools in the country now, I would be learning much of this for the first time.  The skill set and the knowledge base are in place already.  The Irish pharmacy degree and training comply with the relevant EU directive, which means we receive the same training and skill sets as pharmacists in any EU country.  In other countries, all of these services are being delivered quite effectively.  As our skill set and training is analogous to that in countries such as Canada, Irish pharmacists do not struggle to re-register in Canada.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to pharmacists' moving from following instructions to making independent clinical-type decisions.  Every day, pharmacists are making independent decisions, albeit around minor ailments, and referring people to other parts of the health care service and to other health care professionals as appropriate.  He also asked about pharmacy business models and how they are changing, the impact of the Internet and pharmacy chains.  I invite Mr. Daragh Connolly to respond to that question, as he has done some work in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404232800,"counter":945,"content":"<p>We think that what Senator Crown is referring to is what one might call mon-and-pop pharmacies.  There has been constant change in pharmacy in Ireland since the introduction of the State.  Pharmacy is practised in different ways in different jurisdictions, so pharmacies look different in different countries and those pharmacists have different skill sets.  Pharmacists not only are good health care professionals but must also be good retailers.  Many people are not playing to their strengths because previously they did not have to work so hard at the retail end.  There is some agglomeration, with co-operatives of pharmacies coming together in order to give the best value to patients and to be able to give the expert advice those patients want.  The service is evolving and ongoing.  We live in turbulent times and always look at our overheads and cost models and endeavour to offer the best value we can to patients and customers.  We enjoy being embedded in our communities.  We enjoy the accessibility we can offer within our pharmacies to patients and customers.<\/p><p>  To refer to Senator Ciara Conway's point about emergency hormonal contraception, by being able to keep the doors open and by having a retail offering as well as the expert health care advice, we can be available on Saturdays for emergency hormonal contraception and other facilities that cannot be reached through primary care - that is, GPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daragh Connolly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404232800,"counter":946,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke asked about the new medicine service referred to in the appendix to our document.

The new medicine service is currently being implemented across the water in the UK and we are calling for it to be introduced here.  We know anecdotally that when we see our patients coming back having been prescribed a new medicine, they need increased support.  For example, for certain types of condition for which the new medicine service is available in the UK, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, people are put on long-term medication to control the disease and to prevent it from getting worse and progressing.<\/p> <p>In the new medicine service, when patients are initially prescribed medication, they will have an initial consultation with the pharmacist who will outline what the medicine is for, how the patients should take it and what they should do if they experience side effects.  This is something we do when we dispense medication, but the difference with the new medicine service is that patients will return to the pharmacy on two separate occasions a number of weeks later when the pharmacist will again sit down with them to assess how they are getting on in taking the new medication.<\/p><p> Typically, we find that patients stop taking their medication in the early stages because they do not have support in taking it.  They might, for example, experience a side effect and not know what to do.  The new medicine service provides an outlet for them and allows them to sit down again with their pharmacist to discuss how they are getting on.  If they are having medication problems because of the new medicine, the pharmacist can address them and either provide them with support to continue taking the medication or refer them back to or make contact with their GP in order to ensure they remain on some medication for their condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100006#E01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404233400,"counter":949,"content":"<p>On the outcome of that service, the experience in England has been that one third of patients who were previously not taking medicine properly go on to take the medicine properly following intervention by the pharmacist.  Obviously, some work needs to be done to try to get the other two thirds to take their medicine properly, but even to get one third of non-adhering patients to improve their medicine taking has a benefit.<\/p><p>  On the timescale for the moving of medicines from prescription to non-prescription status, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the IMB, will publish a list within the next couple of weeks.  There are no legislative changes required because, under legislation the authority already has the role of deciding whether a medicine should be a prescription medicine or a controlled drug and whether, within the prescription medicine status, it should be considered an S1A, non-repeatable, or an S1B, repeatable.  The authority as an organisation has taken a policy decision to be more proactive in rescheduling medicines which currently require a prescription to non-prescription status because it believes these medicines to be appropriate and safe for use with the advice and support of the pharmacist, as opposed to needing a prescription.<\/p><p>  In regard to generic drugs, we have made rapid progress in the penetration of generic medicines in Ireland since the passing of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act last summer.  It is now obligatory for pharmacists to offer a generic interchangeable medicine once one is available, when medicines have been deemed interchangeable by the HPRA.  We know anecdotally from speaking to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, that it has seen the use of generic medicines escalate dramatically.  The pharmaceutical industry also tells us that the use of its branded medicines has collapsed where generic alternatives are available.<\/p><p>  We also have a process called reference pricing, a rolling process, under way.  This is a process by which the HSE sets a reference price - the maximum price it will pay for any generic medicine.  These prices are set anywhere between 40% and 70% lower than the price of the products beforehand.  Therefore, the combination of the increasing use of generic medicines and the reducing price of generic medicines means that at the lower end of the price scale of medicines, significant savings are coming through.  What will drive our medicines bill in the future is not the tablets 95% of patients are taking on a daily basis but the high tech biological type medicines that smaller numbers of patients are taking to treat more serious conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1404233400,"counter":950,"content":"<p>Is there any anecdotal evidence of a change in patients who have switched to generic medicines in terms of side effects or more regular taking of their medicine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100007#F00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404233400,"counter":951,"content":"<p>Some patients are uncertain about generic medicines.  Also, some research conducted by the University of Limerick two or three months ago suggested some doctors were a little uncertain about such medicines.  However, all of the medicines have been assessed, regulated and licensed by the HPRA on the same basis as proprietary branded medicines.  When patients are uncertain, it is usually because it looks or tastes different, but pharmacists can reassure them that the tablets have been produced to the same high quality.  Once they receive that reassurance from the pharmacist, the majority are comfortable to continue taking them.<\/p><p>  On the drug card used in Denmark, in order for something like it to be rolled out in Ireland, we need unique identifiers for patients.  For a shared health record of patients, every patient, every health professional and every premises from which health services are delivered must be uniquely identifiable.  The Health Identifiers Bill is due to pass shortly and when in place will be the first key step in putting in place the infrastructure required.  The question was asked whether we had started talking to anybody about that shared drug record.  We have been in discussions with the Department of Health on how it proposes to implement an electronic health records system.  As a stakeholder, we have made ourselves available for all of the discussions to be held and the Department has agreed to include us in its stakeholder engagements.  We will bring our expertise to bear and what we know from our colleagues around Europe.<\/p><p>  Similar to the system operating in Denmark, French pharmacists have a system whereby if a patient slots his or her card into the card reader in the pharmacy, the pharmacist can see not only all of the medicines the patient has been prescribed and which have been dispensed to him or her but also any over the counter medicine the patient has bought because the system allows pharmacists to make a record of non-prescription medicines purchased.  This is an essential patient safety measure and I hope we can move towards such a system.  We were probably a little slow in putting the basic infrastructure in place, but we will have the unique identifier system soon and the health information Bill will follow.  Once these are in place, there is no reason we cannot start working on having such a system.  In one way, because we are slow, we can benefit as a result of identifying some of the pitfalls identified in other countries.  The NHS has spent billions, if not tens of billions, on a system that probably does not work; therefore, we now know what not to do.<\/p><p>  I will not argue with Deputy Doherty.  It is a little like groundhog day and I am aware that many others and I have said similar things previously.  We have learned that progress is slow and incremental and that great patience is required to see change.  The Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White, came to our conference in mid-May and said he was extremely open to the idea of introducing new services through pharmacies.  He was particularly anxious to see us come forward and identify the services that could be introduced quickly without legislative change or with the minimum change possible.  That is the reason we chose the two I have referred to as a starting point.  We intend to return to the Minister of State or to whoever will hold that position to engage on these two services and explain that we can deliver on them now.  The minor illness scheme should be cost neutral to the Exchequer because patients are entitled to have these medicines.  All we are trying to do is to streamline the process by which they access these medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1404233400,"counter":952,"content":"<p>Has there been much engagement with the IMO on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100007#F00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404233400,"counter":953,"content":"<p>There has not been engagement with the IMO as it is not up to it to decide what should happen.

We are saying that if these were private patients, they would have immediate access to these medicines.  <\/p><p>  In terms of medicine use reviews and the other expanded services, the experience in other jurisdictions has been that whatever initial trepidation there might have been, when the services are rolled out, doctors and physicians see the benefits.  As Senator John Crown pointed out, doctors, physicians and pharmacists work in collaboration and co-operation in the interest of patients.

To put it bluntly, as one of the HSE national directors did recently, there is more work to be done than we can do.  There is more work available for health care professionals than can be done.<\/p><p>  On the question of poly drug use and abuse of prescription medicines, this has been an issue and it is becoming a greater issue for some of our members because people who are addicted to medicines such as benzodiazepines cannot access them.<\/p> <p>They cannot get access to them by getting a prescription from doctors because doctors are becoming a little more scrupulous or careful about prescribing these medicines.  Our members are being robbed at knifepoint and gunpoint and at the point of baseball bats by people who are desperate for drugs either for themselves or to sell them.  We are acutely aware of that.  We had engaged previously with the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care before the drafting of the amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  We were as keen as she was to do something to help to alleviate this problem.  There are prescribing guidelines in place for benzodiazepines and we have published these guidelines on our website.  All our members are aware of them and of their responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p> Pharmacists are in contact with and talk to one another.  In every community pharmacists get to know the community and that some prescriptions are more genuine than others.  They become immediately suspicious of people who go to one doctor for all their treatment and then suddenly appear to go to another doctor for a prescription for a particular item.  We talk to each other and lift the telephone all the time.  In my area, the western region, the HSE has put in place what is termed a cascade system.  If I have suspicions about a prescription, I ring the next pharmacy or two pharmacies on the cascade.  They know, in turn, the next two pharmacists to ring and therefore within minutes every pharmacy in the region has been alerted to the fact that some prescriptions are doing the rounds which may not be as authentic as they might appear at first glance.<\/p><p> There was a question about price variations for emergency hormonal contraception, colloquially known as the morning after pill.  We do not have a role in pricing.  We are scrupulous about ensuring that we do not make the mistake of thinking we have a role in what prices are charged by private pharmacies to private patients.  Under competition law it would not be appropriate for us to take a view on that.  I accept the point that there is considerable price variation.  The first pharmacy to bring that service to market charged &euro;45 at the time.  This compared rather well to what it would have cost to go to a general practitioner and secure a prescription.  All I can say is that within local markets pharmacies compete with each other to deliver the best value they can.  Anyway, we cannot take a position on the price that they charge for competition reasons.  I absolutely agree it is ludicrous that a woman who needs access to emergency contraception and who has a medical card should have to choose between getting it on time by paying for it or having to wait to get a prescription so that she can get it later.  As we all know, the sooner the medication is taken, the more effective it is and it effectiveness drops off rapidly as time passes.  This is a strong argument in favour of the minor ailment scheme that we wish to roll out with a view to improving access to medicines.

Under the protocol, once a patient has a properly-completed general medical services prescription form from his general practitioner there should be no problem.  The GP is the gatekeeper, as it were, to a patient's eligibility.  If the GP issues the prescription, then we can dispense the medicines in good faith.  The primary care reimbursement service will flag to us afterwards that there is a question mark over a given patient's eligibility or the validity of his medical card.  We will then go back to the patient and explain that he needs to contact the HSE because there is an issue with the eligibility or validity but we can dispense the medicines on the day.  What we have achieved through this protocol with the PCRS is a scenario whereby no patient should be turned away from a pharmacy without his medicines simply because his medical card has been withdrawn.  The idea is that patients have time to make whatever arrangements are necessary.

However, there can be considerable distress among patients who may have left the reception because the computer programme used by the doctor cannot generate a medical card prescription and it is written on a private form instead even though there is an old number.  Certainly, it is distressing for the constituents represented by the members at this committee and the patients we have.  We must work through the process and we gladly work through it with people but it needs to be tightened up because it is creating anxiety.  There is one aspect of this which I see on a day-to-day basis in my pharmacy and which I find particularly heartbreaking.  It can result in people having to leave employment if they lose their medical card because of the cost of the medicines, at &euro;144 per month.  Furthermore, it might highlight to a person that he could be on psychoactive medicines, which can be expensive, and it may show that his condition can take him out of employment.

Under the service the primary care team and the local community pharmacist came together to identify patients who would be appropriate and who would benefit from a medicines use review.  The medicines use review was carried out with the patient and any issues the patient was having with the management of his medications were addressed.  These issues were communicated to the patient's GP.  It is important for everyone involved in the patient's care to be aware of what is going on in order that we can all work together to improve the patient's care.  Then, four to six weeks later, a follow-up medicines use review was carried out to determine whether the patient had benefited from the initial review and whether the medication issues initially addressed in the review had been resolved.

One of the greatest assets any community can have is a pharmacist who knows the people on a first name basis.  That is important because, as the deputation has explained, pharmacists are able to relate to people better.  I welcome the fact that the flu vaccination can be given.  I also welcome the fact that pharmacists now participate in the methadone treatment service.  That is very important, particularly in parts of the community I represent because people do not have to travel and people in other parts of the country do not have to travel either.  That is important.<\/p><p>  I wrote to the Irish Pharmacy Union some time back with several complaints from families of older people who have been changed onto generic drugs.<\/p> <p>Some did not take them because the box was a different colour and they were frightened.  A couple of weeks later the pharmacist asked why they did not take them and they said they did not realise they were the right ones because they were a different colour.  They do ask the pharmacist to tell older people it is the same drug but in a different box.  That is very helpful.<\/p><p> I have seen older family members who are on repeat prescriptions keeping a store of different concoctions in their press.  I have told several doctors in my area to make sure that if people have not used drugs they do not leave them lying around because as well as pharmacies being broken into and attacked by people looking for drugs, houses are broken in to and drugs left lying around are taken.<\/p><p> Do pharmacists communicate with people on repeat prescriptions to ask if they taken all the previous medication?  I have seen older members of my family storing up drugs.  I am concerned for their safety and in general if they are prescribed drugs that they do not need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100008#G01400","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404234600,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I will start at the end and work back up through the questions.  The question of people collecting medicines they do not need, or that they do need but do not take is serious.  We have always advocated a dispose of unused medicines properly, DUMP, scheme to get the medicines out of people&rsquo;s homes.  People can clear out their cupboards and bring the medicines back to the pharmacy so that they are not in the house, running the risk of break-ins or of children and grandchildren getting their hands on them.  It means too that the pharmacist will see what is not being taken and will know that it is either something that should no longer be dispensed to the patient or will have to tell the patient that he or she must take the tablet because it is quite important.<\/p><p>  The incidence of people collecting medicine from the pharmacy that they do not need is falling off because of the prescription charge which is now &euro;2.50 an item.  That might not sound like a lot of money but in some people&rsquo;s budgets it is quite a lot, especially if one is taking ten medicines and it adds up to &euro;25.  Pharmacists are reporting now that more patients come in with multiple items on a prescription and say they will only take the sleeping tablet and pain killer now and come back for the others later when they have the money.  It is almost like a pay as you go system for filling prescriptions as people eke out their medicines to try to avoid paying the charge until it has to be paid.  That will become a bigger issue than unused medicines in people&rsquo;s houses in future.<\/p><p>  I agree that it is important for pharmacists not to just hand out the medicines to people but to say the box, the name, the tablet all look different but it is the same.  Many pharmacists now write the old name on the label.  For example, for a generic drug such as atorvastatin, which used to be called Lipitor, the pharmacist will write &ldquo;same as Lipitor&rdquo; on the label.  We do not want patients not to take their medication because they do not recognise the name.  Equally, we do not want them taking medication from this month&rsquo;s yellow box along with some from last month&rsquo;s blue box, if it is the same tablet, and accidentally doubling up on it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014070100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1404234600,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for being here and their members who provide a tremendous service in the community.
