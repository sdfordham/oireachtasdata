In light of the issue regarding recruitment and retention of doctors, I wish to ask the Minister for Health to consider amending section 49 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, which currently limits access of trainee specialists to those who have graduated within the EU or completed a period of internship within a restricted list of countries.  There are many young doctors working in this country who, despite having plenty of experience, are being blocked from accessing further training as they do not fit this restrictive criteria.  These are skilled and experienced doctors that the Irish health care system badly needs to retain.<\/p> <p>The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 states that a medical practitioner must have completed a period of internship to the satisfaction of the Medical Council to gain access to the trainee specialist division, which is fair enough.  However, the Medical Council states that doctors who gained their qualification outside the EU cannot gain access to training schemes unless they have completed their internship in a restricted list of countries, namely, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the Sudan.  If these doctors completed their internship in a country outside that list, they are deemed ineligible for the trainee specialist division, which is currently a requirement to apply for any of the medical training schemes.  There are currently no means to remediate this.  Many of these doctors have accumulated considerable experience and are working alongside and helping to train junior colleagues who are on training schemes, so there is an irony there.  Any career progression for these doctors is pretty much blocked and, as a result, we are losing these doctors, who are leaving to go to jurisdictions where they can access training and upskill to progress their careers, which is obviously basic for anyone in the profession.<\/p> <p>It was a young doctor, Dr. Sarah Barry, who brought this to my attention. She was a trainee in the midlands GP training scheme and also worked in smaller peripheral hospitals, such as the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore, and St. Loman's psychiatric hospital in Mullingar.  She has seen how reliant these smaller provincial hospitals are on doctors who have completed their medical degrees outside the EU and completed their intern foundation years outside the designated six countries.<\/p> <p>This issue has been flagged repeatedly with the national doctors training and planning association as part of the MacCraith reviews and it has been flagged to the HSE and the Medical Council but, as yet, I am unaware of any concrete plan to rectify the situation.  It appears that simply adding the words \"or its equivalent\" to section 49 of the Act could address the intern year issue blocking access to trainee specialist division and the intern year.  Priority could be granted first to EU residents as a similar system prioritises Australian citizens for their trainee schemes.  I have made my point and I am interested to hear the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#A00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Noone for raising these issues and for giving me the opportunity to update the House on the position in regard to them.

The number of non-consultant hospital doctors also increased by 288 from February 2017 to the end of November 2018, with 6,327 non-consultant hospital doctors employed, an increase of 1,438 in the past decade.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the current difficulties attracting and recruiting consultants, particularly to certain specialties, including psychiatry and paediatrics.

The Medical Council currently recognises internships from Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sudan and Malaysia as being equivalent to Irish internships.  A doctor whose qualification is from a country other than those cannot access specialist training.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, has therefore decided to amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  The amendment will be introduced by a regulated health professions (amendment) Bill, which will amend the five health profession regulatory Acts in respect of a number of areas.  This Bill will amend the Medical Practitioners Act to remove the requirement to hold the equivalent of the certificate of experience to access specialist training.  It is a large and complex Bill and is currently at an advanced stage of drafting by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in liaison with Department officials.  It is expected to be published in this D&aacute;il session, subject to no major issues arising.  <\/p><p>It is important to mention that Ireland is committed to a national policy of health worker self-sufficiency and has signed up to implementing the World Health Organization global code of practice on international recruitment of health personnel.

Article 3.6 of the code recommends that members states \"strive [...] to create a sustainable health workforce and work towards establishing effective health workforce planning, education and training, and retention strategies that will reduce their need to recruit migrant health personnel\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#A00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I do not think I have ever had such a satisfactory answer to a question I have asked as a Commencement matter.

I am sorry that I am slightly out of breath.  I have just returned from An Bord Plean&aacute;la where I attended in respect of the 3,500 units being developed at Poolbeg west, which is in Ringsend.  Last week, it came to public attention that the receiver was appealing the requirement for 900 social and affordable units.  There was an agreement on 18 May 2017 that there would be 900 social and affordable units on that site.  It was written into the special development zone, SDZ, terms.  It then followed that there was to be negotiations between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dublin City Council and the receiver in respect of the delivery of the 550 units which are not covered by legislation.  Unfortunately, nothing happened for ten months.  At five minutes to midnight yesterday, the assistant CEO of Dublin City Council, Mr. Shakespeare, issued a letter saying that negotiations commenced at the weekend.  The inaction and inactivity by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which says that social and affordable housing is a priority, is a joke.  What is going on?<\/p> <p>We are not only in a social housing crisis, but also an affordable housing crisis.  The programme for Government states that an affordable housing scheme would be announced.  There is an affordable loans scheme, but no affordable housing scheme.  I have spent two days at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have raised this issue twice under Commencement matters in this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, told me 18 months ago that there was no need for a pilot scheme on affordable housing on the Poolbeg west or the old Irish Glass Bottle sites and that there would be a national programme.  We have no national programme and we have no plans for affordable housing.  We nearly lost, and may still lose, 550 units in a prime location 2 km from the city centre.  We will have no integrated housing, rather we will have a dormant village in the heart of the city.  That is poor planning.<\/p> <p>This is at the Minister of State's door.  I am sorry that neither the Minister of State, Deputy English, nor the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is here because I am angry, as is the local community, but this goes much further than just Ringsend, Sandymount and Pearse Street.  Affordable housing is a national issue.  All we have heard from this Government is talk, but we have seen no action.  Negotiations only began at five minutes to midnight with the likelihood of losing 550 units.  That is unacceptable to me.  We want to see action.  This is in the Minister, Deputy Murphy's own back garden, yet we have seen no action from him.  Do we not care about affordable housing and social housing?  Certainly in the community in which I live, my neighbours feel that the Government no longer has any focus and only worries about the next headcount, which is getting bigger.  Urban villages in this city are being destroyed due to a lack of planning, a lack of commitment from this Government and a lack of policy.<\/p> <p>I am sorry the Minister of State is here because it should be the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Minister, Deputy Murphy, taking this debate.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, has a pain in his head from listening to me talking about affordability in this city and I wonder if that is the reason he is not here today.  We need action, not words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#B00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  First, it is encouraging to note recent media reports which suggest that the receiver has agreed to enter into negotiations with Dublin City Council on the provision of affordable housing on the site with the aim of entering into a binding agreement which will result in the provision of additional affordable units.  I wish the parties well in their discussions and I know that the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and his Department are ready and available to support and encourage such engagement by providing the necessary policy clarity at the relevant and appropriate time.<\/p> <p>It is worth clarifying that the Minister&rsquo;s role in relation to the planning system is primarily to provide the policy and legislative framework to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their statutory planning functions.  Therefore, in respect of the appeal which has been made in relation to the planning scheme for the Poolbeg SDZ, it is ultimately a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to determine this appeal and neither the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government nor his Department can be involved in the case.<\/p> <p>It is very important for the public to know, however, that his Department has consistently supported engagement on the development of Poolbeg west in order to ensure the level of social housing delivered on this site is far in excess of the 350 or so homes that would be ordinarily delivered through Part V of the Planning Act.  For example, the observations made by the Minister&rsquo;s Department on the draft planning scheme are very clear on this point and also clearly signal that there could be no compulsion about such matters.  Such arrangements would have to be progressed in the context of an agreement that would detail the various funding, delivery and value for money considerations that apply in the ordinary course of such matters parallel to, but separate from, the finalisation and consideration of the planning merits of the scheme.  The negotiations currently under way and the appeal process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la do not alter this position.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s Department remains committed to working with the city council, any relevant approved housing bodies and either the receiver or developers of the SDZ area in securing additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and at the scale proposed in the adopted planning scheme, but subject to agreement on all the normal relevant terms including value for money aspects.  It is, therefore, for the relevant parties using the array of social housing delivery mechanisms supported by the Minister's Department, including capital and current funded programmes delivered through the local authorities and approved housing bodies, to realise the potential for this site including enhanced social housing delivery.<\/p> <p>As I said at the outset, the Minister wishes all parties well in these discussions and he is hopeful that a resolution will be reached in the short term to pave the way for the development of the Poolbeg west SDZ, realising the much needed housing mix that it promises to deliver.  Whatever the result of the hearing currently under way, the Minister would like to assure the local community of his continued commitment to ensuring that the commitments regarding social and affordable housing will be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#B00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I find the answer the Minister of State gave to be totally unacceptable.

In a letter yesterday, Richard Shakespeare, assistant chief executive, planning and property development, Dublin City Council clearly indicates that the negotiations are taking place between the Department, the council and the receiver.  Therefore, the Minister of State has misled the House.  I ask him to go back to the Department, seek clarification, come back to the House and correct the record.

I ask him to return speedily because his reputation is on the line and his remarks are on the record of this House.  He should seek clarification on whether the Department is actively involved in negotiations.  Is it playing an active role?  The Minister of State indicated that it is not.  He quoted recent media reports in which Mr. Richard Shakespeare stated that the Department is involved in negotiations.

The parents of these children, who, through their experience, are experts, rightly rejoiced after the motion was passed.  They believed that, finally, they would be listened to and respected, particularly in the context of their experience, their voice and their input.  This has not happened to date.  On 16 February, members of Our Children's Voice, the warriors who have been at the forefront of this fight since the very beginning, met the representative from the HSE and were assured that he was very happy for parent representatives to be on the steering group and that he would be in touch with an invitation.  There was silence thereafter until just two weeks ago.  At that point, the HSE representative emailed to state that the executive will proceed with the establishment of the reference group and that further consideration will be given to the issue of the steering group.<\/p> <p>Let me be clear.  There is no need for those in the HSE to exercise their grey matter.  There is no need for the executive to give further consideration to this issue.  The House made its decision on 6 February.  Non-elected HSE representatives do not have authority over the decisions and determination of the Seanad.  Every Member of this House should be very concerned by the brazen disregard of the decisions of this House by the HSE.  I want to reiterate why this House passed my motion unopposed.  A few years ago, the HSE used a steering group, the membership of which included service users, in order to develop its policy on service user engagement.  This was the much-lauded and forward-thinking strategy on service user engagement by the HSE and the Department of Health.  Authentic service user engagement is vital and best practice.<\/p> <p>Our Children's Voice was represented on the HSE clinical group on domiciliary care for children.  There are precedents for this type of representation.  The parents making this representation today have long been organised in advocating on behalf of their children and have the necessary skill set to operate at steering group level.  This is about listening to the real experts, namely, the people who live with this day in and day out.  They are experts through experience and necessity.  The HSE has a real opportunity to gain from their expertise.  Our Children's Voice's mission statement indicates that it is \"a group of parents, hoping to give children who have high medical\/physical needs or life-limiting conditions a voice that will be heard\".  I ask the Minister of State to tell me why they are being silenced.  Why are we allowing the HSE to dictate to the Seanad, which passed my motion unopposed in February?  What is happening is disgraceful and disrespectful and it will be brought up in this House again and again until the HSE decides - or is instructed by the relevant Minister - to allow parents to join the steering group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#C00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Devine for raising the issue of parental representation regarding the care of children with complex medical needs.  Both the Minister and I understand the importance of this issue for parents.  Children with complex healthcare needs have substantial medical requirements as a result of one or more congenital, acquired or chronic conditions and there is frequently a need for technological assistance and ongoing nursing care to support parents in caring for their children at home.  The care of these children is best managed in partnership between parents and specialist medical staff who work together to help children lead as normal a life as possible and to avoid hospital admission.  To this end, the Minister secured additional funding in budget 2018 to increase the number of clinical paediatric home care packages delivered from 507 in 2017 to 584 this year.  I am sure the House will welcome this expansion of such an important service.<\/p> <p>Turning to the specific issue of parental representation, some parents and representative groups have recently sought to be included on the HSE's primary care steering group for children with complex medical needs.  Following discussion in this House on 6 February, the matter has been re-examined in recent weeks.  However, as was referenced in the House previously, this steering group is a clinical group which, as part of its remit, scrutinises commercially sensitive issues relating to the business process.  Representation on the group is, therefore, not the best or most appropriate means of securing the views of parents.<\/p> <p>We all want to ensure that parents can contribute their full expertise and knowledge regarding the needs of their children.  It is for this reason that the HSE will establish a parental reference group that will feed directly into the work of the steering group.  Although some details are still to be finalised, it is intended that the reference group will have an independent chair and up to ten parent representatives and will include the national lead for children with complex medical conditions as a member.  The group will meet up to three times each year.  This will include meeting the steering group.  The proposed structure will ensure that the voices of more parents from across the country can be heard directly in order to help us shape how we deliver care to their children.<\/p> <p>It is also important to note that, as part of a national quality assurance process, individual meetings have taken place between the HSE and parents in respect of the provision of paediatric care packages and these meetings will continue throughout the year.  The HSE will also be holding workshops with parents, which, again, will enable parents to be heard in respect of the needs of their children.<\/p> <p>The provision of additional paediatric home care packages and the establishment of the parental reference group demonstrate that the Government is committed to supporting the families of children with complex medical needs and to ensuring the provision of a service that works for parents and reflects their expertise and knowledge regarding those needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#C00700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's reply is completely unacceptable.

This situation speaks for itself and has led to a lot of recent publicity because there is an increase in comment, and more importantly, concern among residents and the general public.<\/p> <p>Deer populations have greatly increased in the last few years.  Before I get into the matter I would like to congratulate the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, on the further investment announced in the national development plan for trails and other amenities in the national park.  That is very important for Killarney and for tourism.<\/p> <p>I refer to the deer situation.  As I have said, the deer population has greatly increased.  What is primarily needed is a proper management plan and engagement between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Kerry County Council.  In the last few years the deer are encroaching on farmland all over the place, well outside the national park.  I know they are a wild animal and we cannot say they are totally the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but in a sense they are because that is the deer's' primary home.  I know that farmers can get a licence, and if the deer are on their property and damaging vegetation and feed, they can deal with it.  There has been a significant cull this year of about 97 animals.  Once the culls are happening properly in the open season, I think it is proper.<\/p> <p>We do not have an exact count for the native red or the sika, but the sika are also growing in number and, as we know, they are an imported species.  The Kerry Deer Society, of which I am a member, would not mind seeing a huge reduction in the number of sika.  They are more difficult to deal with than red deer.  They probably do not do as much damage to grazing, but they are all over the place and there was an unfortunate incident on Innisfallen Island where a few of them were found starved to death because there was no grazing left for them and the number there has been culled down to about 20.  I would argue that 20 is still too many sika to be left on Innisfallen Island, but that is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service to consider further.<\/p> <p>I wonder if the service is considering not alone depopulation, but translocation of deer.  I am thinking of the Kerry red, and in the interests of genetic purity, that we could transport some of these deer to other national parks.  I do not know about Ballycroy.  It is a vast acreage in Mayo.  There are some deer in Letterfrack already and in Doneraile.  The State should consider other offshore islands.  There have been some deer for years on Inishvickillane, thanks to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  There are other offshore islands that could be considered.  Perhaps that would be good for the deer as well.<\/p> <p>The concern is among neighbouring landowners on all sides of Killarney National Park - north, south, east and west.  The deer are even encroaching slightly on the town, coming in at King's Bridge, opposite St. Mary's Cathedral.  There are grass verges there and there has been some good grass growth.  The deer have been encroaching during the night and have been photographed right outside the cathedral gates.  That has been a new development.<\/p> <p>I could go on about a whole lot of other aspects but I do not think there is any point.  I am looking forward to hearing the statement the Minister of State has on the matter and I am sure we can have further engagement.  However, I would ask in the interests of road safety as well as everything else, that there be an active engagement with Kerry County Council on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#D00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>As Senator Coghlan will be aware, my Department together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Deer Management in Ireland - A Framework for Action in 2015, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.<\/p><p>There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resource are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department does license the hunting of deer, my Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  It is not part of the remit of the Department, nor indeed would it be generally possible to cordon them onto specific areas of land.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p><p>With regard to Killarney National Park in particular, Senator Coghlan will be aware that the Department, as part of its regular ongoing management operations, carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands, where appropriate.  Deer have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and also wet woodlands within the park, for example by bark stripping of mature trees and preventing regeneration.<\/p><p>My Department commissioned a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in Kerry national park.  The study found that the total estimated red deer density over the entire study area of 13.64 sq. km. was some 708 deer.  A further census of areas of the park was commissioned by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, southern division and conducted in spring 2017.  On foot of these reports <i>circa<\/i>100 deer have been culled within the park to date during 2018.  This is in addition to more than 120 deer which have been culled between 2015 and 2017.<\/p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing proactive management of the habitats and species in Killarney National Park, it is also proposed to conduct a Killarney National Park deer census during 2018.  This work will be undertaken by external specialists.  It is hoped to initiate this process shortly.  As mentioned earlier, the Department does not own the deer population.  Deer are wild animals and they roam freely throughout the countryside.  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners.  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, however, there is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  Landowners may also apply to the Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where necessary outside the annual open seasons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage. <\/p><p>The Department has granted over 5,000 deer hunting licences for the current deer hunting season.  Licences are issued for an annual period with all licences expiring on 31 July 2018.  Last year the Department issued 21 section 42 permits for deer in Kerry.  To date this year, eight section 42 permits for deer have been granted for Kerry with nine applications currently under consideration.  <\/p><p>The Senator will also be aware of the issue of fencing, which has sometimes been raised with regard to deer management in Killarney National Park.  There are no plans to fence the national park.  Fencing it would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  The presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and consequently fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.  The park is over 10.000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task that is unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking down fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.  The erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.  There are many deer outside the park boundaries.  I am aware that there have been cases where wild deer have been involved in collisions with vehicles.  I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists, as well as improved, possibly larger, signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  <\/p><p>Officials from the Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand that Kerry County Council has prepared a scheme of works, which includes a number of measures including the trimming back of overhanging tree branches and the enhancement and relocation of roadside signs etc., in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#D00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I accept there always has been culling of old and infirm animals, I refer to the native red deer primarily, which has been important but it is now necessary to do more.  There are over 200 deer at Knockreer and Killarney golf club alone, which is only a small section of Killarney National Park.  In Muckross there are several herds, which is apart from what is on Torc, Mangerton and the rugged terrain which was referred to.  I am sceptical about the number given of 708 but am delighted that another deer count by external specialists will be undertaken this year, which I welcome very much.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State spoke of the number of licences that had been issued.  It is quite in order for farmers to be allowed do this on their own ground because if the deer are on their land, they are the farmer's property.  However, within Killarney National Park, where so many people roam freely through trails and walks, it is essential that the Department would not issue licences to anyone apart from its own staff or rangers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#E00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

The fact that two out of every five people in Ireland know someone who is experiencing domestic violence is obviously a concern for everybody but another concern is how taxpayers' money was used in formulating a campaign that has since been pulled because obviously it is not fit for purpose.  One key issue is that approximately 28% of people suffering from abuse, abusive relationships and domestic violence are separated from their partners and the abuse still goes on.  One issue - it comes back to housing believe it or not - is there simply is no place for people to go when they are suffering in a domestic relationship which has turned violent and abusive.  As well as outlining what went wrong with the advertising campaign, the Minister might outline what strategy is in place to assist those women who need to move out of the family home with their children.  Many of them are facing little or no choice other than moving into the house of a friend, relation or family member.  In some cases, tragically, they must sleep in their cars to avoid the abuse they are suffering.  The current statistics are that Women's Aid dealt with 21,451 calls last year, of which domestic violence issues accounted for 15,000.<\/p><p>While the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is coming to the House to discuss the Good Friday Agreement and its 20th anniversary, there is also the issue of the undocumented Irish.  Promises were made by President Trump on St. Patrick's Day in the White House on a reciprocal arrangement on visas for the Irish in the US and for US citizens here.  We on this side of the House introduced a Bill in 2012 to give to US citizens who come to Ireland, and who find it extraordinarily difficult to get work permits to stay in the country, 10,500 visas a year.  Our hope is this would be the basis for a reciprocal arrangement with the United States.  The Irish Pastoral Centre in Boston, led by Kieran O'Sullivan from my part of the world, does extraordinary work in helping the undocumented Irish.  This is in light of the increasing numbers being deported, with 50% to 100% more undocumented people being arrested and deported from all communities, including the Irish community in the United States.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The window of opportunity that was afforded to the Irish Government by President Trump on the St. Patrick's Day visit needs to be pursued in terms of turning that promise of doing a deal between Ireland and the United States into a reality in the time available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Will the Leader arrange to have a debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy?

Everyone agrees that health, housing and education are the three major issues that need to be focused on.  It is important that this House has some update from the Minister on the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  I want to focus in particular on several issues.

While it is being discussed later on this afternoon, due to bereavement I have to head west.  I will just make three brief points on it.  If the Minister is serious about supporting agriculture, he needs to immediately instruct the payment of all outstanding payments to farmers.  I refer not only to GLAS payments, but to all of the other payments.  This would mean a huge amount to farmers, particularly farmers in the west who are really struggling to survive at this time.  There is no reason whatsoever why these outstanding payments cannot be made.  I urge the Minister to make them and to make a commitment that he will have them paid by the end of the month.<\/p> <p>I also ask him to suspend all inspections for the moment because of the awful weather we have had.  There is no point in inspecting farms at this time, when farmers are in crisis mode.  Those inspections can be delayed and it is within the Minister's capacity to do so.  I also appeal to the co-operatives not to take advantage of the fact that the demand for hay and silage is so high and to be considerate of the fact that the customers they have in those farmers are reliable customers who support them year after year and month after month.  Obviously the voucher system, for which we have been calling since last October, needs to be implemented by the Minister.  It would have been simple for him to do that.  A framework needs to be in put in place whereby something will be ready when we again have crises such as those caused by the really inclement or savage weather we have had in order that a button can be pressed and farmers can be helped in their time of need.

Last Tuesday night my sister, Mary, was very sick and was taken very ill.  She was given a letter by her doctor stating she had to go to the emergency department immediately.  She had a condition called Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which is like shingles in the ear and with which there is a very strong possibility of losing one's hearing or having one's face paralysed.  In any event, I brought her into the emergency department.  She was as weak as a kitten and she sat in the emergency department.  Eventually I got a very nice nurse to bring her in and get her on a trolley because she was about to faint.  It was at 8 p.m. last Tuesday evening that she was admitted.  We knew by the letter which she had been given that she had to be put on intravenous antibiotics straight away.  Unfortunately she did not get to see a doctor until 7 a.m. the next morning and did not receive antibiotics until 8 a.m.<\/p> <p>I am not just talking about Mary.  What I really want to talk about is what I saw in there.  It was like something out of a war zone.  That is the only way I can describe it.  The poor doctors and nurses were trying to walk around trolleys.  They could hardly move with the trolley situation.  The old people there were crying out in pain and crying out for their loved ones.  My heart went out to the doctors and nurses.  At one point I pleaded with one of the nurses to try to see if we could get Mary on this antibiotic.  We were worried because she could lose her livelihood if she lost her hearing.  That is what we were concerned about.  The poor nurse told me that they did not even have her chart yet.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I repeat that this emergency department was like a war zone.

This means that 84.12% of members of the Defence Forces are 7% worse off than every other worker in this State based on averages.  We also learn that if a serving soldier from the rank of captain and below has three children, he or she qualifies for family income supplement.

I ask that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs come before the House.  When we discuss the eighth amendment, how the people will, should or might vote and the legislation on the termination of pregnancy, whatever decision the people make, we must speak about the profound loss and bereavement that accompanies such decisions.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, spoke well about family planning, contraception, counselling and sexual health in the context of legislation.  However, very little is being done regarding bereavement counselling, mourning counselling or the outstanding and lifelong grief that family and their children were experiencing as a result of the woman's loss.  I recommend that Senators listen to the interview.  The woman in question was not judgmental in any way.  She was just telling her story.<\/p><p>In my report on dying, death and bereavement in Ireland, I mention how all of us are affected by this - 100% of our lives and 100% of the time.

Those services should be there in parallel to the legislation, whatever shape it takes.  I would like the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House to discuss this matter.  I would also like her to take on board my recommendations, which relate - in the context of every sphere of young people's lives, of education, of teaching and of family life - to how we can and should deal with this matter.  A loss such as that experienced by the woman to whom I refer will be with her and her children for the rest of their lives.

Yesterday, however, the Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, indicated and acknowledged that to exclude specific cases was a mistake.  I welcome this more constructive approach; it is long overdue.  There is a need for compassion towards women whose only crime was being poor and vulnerable and who were considered and treated as being worthless by society.

Personal attacks on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or the Taoiseach do not get us anywhere.  If anything, what was said at the weekend about these members of the Government displays ignorance on the part of the Deputy in question.  It is easy to play the blame game in respect of housing.  The issue of housing is very serious.  The housing crisis does not just affect people from one socioeconomic background.  Regardless of whether they are working, people face a challenge in terms of finding affordable houses they can either rent or purchase.  More and more, it is becoming evident that there is no divide regarding this problem.  The idea that one has to be from a certain socioeconomic background in order to find solutions or to have the will to serve the people is utter nonsense.  However, it seems to fit into a certain populist rhetoric.<\/p> <p>It would be better if Deputy Darragh O'Brien sought to hold local authorities to account.  For example, this year alone, the capital budget for the construction of house has risen from &euro;307 million to &euro;638 million.  On the other hand, very little social housing is being built.  The lack of construction of social housing is impacting on the entire market.  As a result of it, people who should be in social housing are trying to find private rented accommodation.  The latter is placing increased pressure on that sector.  Until 2010, 6,000 social houses were being built each year.  The question that arises in this regard relates to what local authorities are doing with the funding to which I refer.  Fianna F&aacute;il controls a significant number of local authorities.  Is property being acquired for the construction of social housing?  Have the appropriate personnel been hired in order that local authorities might have the relevant expertise available to them to allow them to build houses?  Questions have to be asked at this stage.  The Government is not going to build these houses.  From a statutory point of view, as housing authorities, councils have an obligation to build houses.  Why are they not doing so?  Why are they not being held to account by councillors from other parties who have been very critical of the Government regarding the lack of social housing.  We have gone beyond the point whereby this matter is being treated as a political football.  There are solutions available but the must be implemented.  The local authorities need to play their part and Deputy Darragh O'Brien needs to begin with the representatives from his party who are members of those authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#K00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I wish to acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of representatives from the Historical and Reconciliatory Police Society, known affectionately as the HARP Society.

Since then, however, we have heard many reports of the serious issues facing the principals, boards, teachers, parents and students in the 575 schools awaiting delivery of previous commitments to refurbishment, repair and expansion.  Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to represent my colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, who has been fighting for the Balinteer Educate Together national school, Dublin 14, as it tries to get its premises improved.  I heard from this and other schools about the problems this causes.  One in particular, Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna, County Dublin, has been waiting 22 years for the delivery of new school buildings.  Trish McGinley, the chair of the school's board outlined to RT&Eacute;'s \"Drivetime\" on Friday the effect such unfathomable delays have had on the staff and pupils at the school, as well as the incredibly poor response they have received from the Department of Education and Skills in this regard.<\/p> <p>I was contacted by Tramore Educate Together national school, County Waterford.  The population of Tramore is rising exponentially.  When I was a child, it was 3,000.  In the 1990s, it rose to 6,500.  In 2016, it stood at 10,381.  Fortunately, the Minister recently turned around a proposed constraint on class intake.  While this was welcomed, the school needs to move to a new site.  There is land available close by and the Department has proposed that the school will have to split classes between two sites. This is not good for health and safety.

Three years ago, many Members of both Houses stood in celebration with the LGBT community as the announcement came from the RDS that the civil marriage equality referendum had passed.  The legislation that gave effect to marriage equality, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, affords equal rights to same-sex couples who wish to have children and form families.  It has been three years since that historic legislation was passed by the Oireachtas.  However, Parts 2 and 3, which confer equal family rights for those who can only conceive through assisted human reproduction, have to be yet commenced by the Minister for Health.  While we claim that in this State all family formations hold equal esteem before the law, there are many stark realities that face these families, aside from simply not having equal status to others.  There are realities such as preventing a family from applying for an Irish passport and citizenship for their child, preventing the child from accessing his or her parents' estate if they pass away intestate and preventing a parent from making emergency health decisions on behalf of a child in the case where the other parent may be out of the country.<\/p> <p>I, like the Leader and many others, have been seeking certainty in respect of this matter for some time.  I am saddened that I and many others have been fobbed off by the Department of Health with deadlines which have been consistently missed and responses which have not been transparent or reasonable.  In that context, I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to call on the Minister for Health to come to the House to explain this delay, which has gone on for too long without any rationale.  I do not do this lightly.  However, given that I have attempted to get clear answers through different Oireachtas avenues on this issue, the Department seems unwilling to give them to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#L00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#L00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#L00600","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Several people referred to the delivery of housing.  It is important to note that in the context of the delivery of student apartments, over 2,600 bed units have been provided in the past 18 months.  Another 5,000 are under construction and the target is 21,000 units by 2024.  This will remove approximately 5,000 houses from student accommodation and make them available to those working or families.  The delivery of social housing is occurring but I accept that delivery is not fast enough.  We seem to have a problem with procedures right across the system, from agreeing that social housing should be built to navigating the planning process to proceeding to commencement and on to getting the work done.  The position needs to be reviewed.  Last Thursday, I attended a launch in my former local authority area in respect of the completion of 52 new houses and the turning of the sod regarding construction of a further 47.  That is just one of nine ongoing projects in Cork city.  The last time I had a Commencement matter on this issue, the Minister announced the provision of &euro;39 million in funding for seven different projects involving the construction of 134 houses.  That was a welcome development.  I make no apologies for bringing the Minister in and ensuring that projects are followed up on.  Local authority members and management, the Department and the Minister all have a part to play in that regard.<\/p> <p>When the downturn hit the construction industry, there was a significant loss of jobs.  Between 2008 and 2011, over 200,000 jobs were lost.  We are now back to having full employment.

Let us be positive, in that the jobs have been created here in other areas and we need to consider the challenge in the construction industry and how we can bring in the people with the relevant skills and how we can get the private sector moving at a far faster pace.  We must also examine how we are currently delivering local authority and social housing.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise one area of the 2040 national development project, namely, the healthcare sector.  Last week, the Department of Education and Skills announced plans for the building of new schools and it will set out the programme for the next four to five years.  An important issue in the health service concerns me.  Under the last Government, by which I mean the Administration prior to 2011, it took more than 25 years before the children's hospital was even started.  I am concerned that we have set up a clear programme for the building of new hospitals.  We need to bring the Minister for Health before the House to set out how this programme regarding the building of new hospitals and the new healthcare facilities will be implemented, the timeline in each case and a clear programme of action.  I am concerned that it may fall between two stools, that is, between the Department of Health, the HSE, local authorities and so on.  It is something we need to look at and something on which we should hold a debate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#L00700","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I also want to address the school builds.

He mentioned the issue of Norwegian Airlines cutting the winter flights.  The airline has done that in Cork as well.  The winter flights from Cork and Shannon are not happening this season.  That has a major knock-on effect for both the tourism sector and the self-confidence of the region.  It is important to have this debate about regional development, what we will do with Project Ireland 2040 and how we will develop the country.  If we are to develop Dublin Airport to its full potential and put a second runway in there, we must ensure that the other airports are protected.  We have a motorway journey from Cork to Dublin of two hours with buses going on the hour, if not on the half-hour.  That connectivity is there.  What we need is a connectivity to ensure that the airlines will work appropriately and will come into these regions, whether it is Shannon or Cork, in order that the tourism sector and the business sector in particular in those areas can flourish.<\/p> <p>We find in Cork that the lack of connectivity to the United States for the business sector is a big issue.  They want to be hitting the US mainland directly from Cork.  What they do not want is to be obliged to go to Dublin and then get a flight out because that is not how they want to spend their day.  The big pharmaceutical and bio-pharmaceutical plants in Cork are huge operations and need that connectivity to their American bases.  A debate with the Minister is important because unless we model and change Government policy on these issues, Dublin Airport will develop into a monster and the two other regional airports that have an international focus, Shannon and Cork, may not achieve their full potential.  Shannon has an advantage over Cork because it has independent status.  Perhaps we should consider re-opening that debate in Cork because if we had independent status, we might be able to have a bigger slice of the cake we need to deliver both Project Ireland 2040 as a national plan and the regional development this country badly requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#N00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the 20 Members of the House for their contributions on the Order of Business.

The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, when confronted about the issue at the publication yesterday, agreed to reflect upon the issues that were raised.  All of us recognise that this campaign has been going on since 2016.  It is an issue that requires huge support to be given to the victims of domestic violence.  As the Senator rightly said, that involves legislative means plus support.  Any issues that have been addressed need to be taken on board.  The campaign was well intentioned.  We are seeing extra resources being directed to assist the victims of domestic violence.  It is, as I stated yesterday, a menace in society that we must stamp out.  It has no place in Irish society.  The Government is committed to doing all that it can in the area of domestic violence.  As I stated yesterday, the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 is going through the Lower House.  The second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence has been published.  It has three central pillars, namely, prevention, provision of services to victims and holding perpetrators to account, along with implementation, monitoring and data.  It is important to recognise that the advertisement campaign was commissioned to reach an audience, raise awareness and encourage support.  If anybody has an issue with the campaign, he or she needs to be listened to as well.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the voices that spoke yesterday will be heard.

There was a telling contribution on radio this morning of a young man who spoke eloquently about whether he would come home and about the text alert system that is activated when US immigration is on the move in parts of the north-east United States.  It is an issue that will not go away and one on which we need to see continuous work.  I will work on a bipartisan basis on that.  It is important that we all support the initiatives being taken.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of housing and the two housing summits with the Minister and the CEOs of the different councils.

There are different viewpoints but there is a process that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has commissioned.  Maybe we can see what the outcome from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is.  I do not want to pre-empt the result of that but we will come back to it, if that is okay with Senator Norris.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of fodder to farmers.  I think we all agree there is a need to see fodder provided, be it in the east, west, south or north of the country.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has been proactive on the matter, as have Members of this House.  I pay tribute to Senator Lombard who in his own constituency of Cork South-West - I do not wish him to come back to Cork South-Central - has been proactive in working with the co-operatives and farmers in the area.  I compliment him on that.  It is important to recognise that payments have been made.  The Minister has been proactive on the matter and action has been taken by Government.  It is about ensuring that we have cattle fed.  It is about ensuring that fodder is provided to farmers.  It is also about ensuring that the co-operatives, which have worked with farmers, will not be seen to be overzealous in demanding payment.  The Government has put in place a range of incentives.  We will have the debate as part of Private Members' business later on.  It is also important to recognise that we also need to look at the issue of climate change and how that has an effect on us as a country.  As Members know quite well, we have now had weeks of incessant rain during which I would say we have not had two days of drying.  Moreover, land and underfoot conditions are very wet.  The Minister has been proactive.  We always have an animal welfare scheme.  There is a range of farm relief schemes available to farmers and that will come across as part of the debate tonight on the Private Members' motion.  I am not familiar with the issue the Senator raised regarding the transport issues in terms of the projects but if the Senator wants to give them to me later, I would be happy to take them up with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of trolleys in hospitals.  I completely empathise with the Senator, not only on her family's situation but in that every patient who is on a trolley is a person who deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At a time when we have the biggest spend on health care in the history of the State and our spend <i>per capita<\/i>is one of the highest in Europe there is something fundamentally wrong.  The political class and the Minister are blamed when there is no money available.  There has been an increase in recruitment and more hospital beds have been opened but I recognise that there has been an increase in attendances at emergency departments.  In budget 2018 &euro;40 million extra was provided to respond to winter pressures, &euro;25 million was allocated this year for social care measures which was &euro;3.5 million for 480 additional transitional care beds and &euro;18 million for 1,080 additional home support packages.  An additional 204 beds have been opened but someone coming into the country from abroad would imagine there was nothing happening.  It is not good enough that there are people on trolleys or that people have to be treated badly but the Government launched a national development plan which allows for an increase of some 2,000 extra acute beds.  It is important to consider the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It involves an emphasis on primary care and the need to see that develop.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.  What is the HSE doing to eliminate the problems?  We blame the Government in many cases.  I have been in a situation similar to the Senator's because family members of mine were in the emergency department over the Easter break.  There is something fundamentally wrong when a patient has to wait three hours for a discharge letter to be told they can walk out the door because they are okay.  There is something fundamentally wrong when a triage nurse cannot tell them they can go home, or if they have to wait eight hours when it is clear that the system is not working to benefit the patient.  As a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health I believe it is time all the vested interests in the health sector came out of their silos and into the centre on behalf of the patient.  That is the point that comes through in the Senator's story today, that it is distressing and should not have to happen.  <br\/><br\/>Senators Feighan and &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the North and the Good Friday Agreement.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be in the House today.  We should all take note of Bill Clinton's remark, &quot;don't let it go, you can't let it go by doing nothing&quot;.  We want to see the Assembly back in Stormont.  That requires everybody, gach duine le ch&eacute;ile, working together.  The Minister has said repeatedly that we cannot go back to the bad old days and we do not want to go back to them.  We want to see mature, sensible decisions made to return to power-sharing and the Assembly, to work for the people.  That requires compromise on all sides.  This morning we remember the former First Lady of the United States, Barbara Bush, who said compromise is not a filthy thing, it is a good thing.  The same applies to politics around the world.  <br\/><br\/>Senators Leyden and Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  We debated this yesterday on the Order of Business.  I do not want to get into an argument again but I understand that the Senators represent Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and other organisations.  We all want to see the men and women in our Defence Forces treated fairly and properly.  Senator Craughwell spoke about family income supplement; 1.3% of serving members receive that support.  To hear Senator Craughwell this morning one would swear half the Army was on that support.  It is not acceptable that people are on family income supplement.  I am not advocating that.  The Minister of State with responsibility for defence has started an independently chaired review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme over the past two years when more people have joined the Defence Forces than left it.  In addition, new pay scales have been introduced for the post-2013 recruits and starting salaries have increased by 25%.  Those are facts.  Under the national pay agreement all wages up to &euro;70,000 will be restored.  There is a review of 1994 and 2006 contracts.  In addition, there has been capital investment in ships, equipment, barracks, planes and there is an active recruitment campaign such that 751 people joined the Defence Forces last year.  I do not want to have a political row because I value and respect the members of the Defence Forces, some of whom are my friends, some past pupils, and, as Senator Leyden said, many live around Haulbowline.  We want to see pay and conditions increase and the achievements of our Defence Forces recognised and respected and I hope that will happen.  Politicising it is the wrong way to do it.  I would be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, come to the House again.  <br\/><br\/>I agree with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell about the story of Caroline and Michael who spoke on the &quot;Today with Sean O'Rourke&quot; programme.  They deserve great credit for the way they told their story and their bravery in coming forward.  The committee I chaired produced an end of life care report and the Senator did major work in her own right which should not be left sitting on a shelf.  We must have empathy, compassion, care, respect and always treat people properly.  The Senator was correct in what she said this morning.  As part of the heads of the Bill relating to the eighth amendment the Minister for Health has spoken about maternal care and the care of infants.  The ancillary recommendations of the committee on the eighth amendment will also resonate with some of what the Senator said this morning.  We need to take greater care of people.  I would be happy to invite the Minister to the House on this as a standalone item.  I do not wish to patronise Senator O'Donnell but we cannot allow a report that is a landmark be left sitting on a shelf because it is about people.  People should not have to go on a radio programme being personal and open about their situation.  I compliment their courage in telling their story.  We need to have compassion in our maternity services and I hope we continue to have it. <br\/><br\/>I join with Senator Devine in commending the Minister for Justice and Equality on broadening the Magdalen laundries redress scheme.  The sign of a good Minister is that he listens.  It is a question of including women who were doing the same work as others and being treated in the same way.  I welcome that decision. <br\/><br\/>Senators Mulherin and Davitt got into an argument on housing.  As Leader of the House I try not to be personal but when the only remark of Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesman on housing is about a Minister or a Taoiseach without reference to policy that does not say a whole lot.  We will have a debate on housing.  We have come through the worst of recessionary times.

The fundamentals are that we do need to see a collective end to the scourge of people being homeless and being put into hotels.  We need to see a continuation of the social housing building that the Government has commenced.  We need to see the issue of the affordability of land being tackled and we need to look at all measures that can increase the output and supply of housing.  Personalised attacks on the Taoiseach or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government have nothing to offer in any debate.  What we need to see is not just idle rhetoric but actual reality happening in terms of policy development.  I looking forward to working with all Senators to see that happen.<\/p> <p>Senators Maria Byrne and Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the participation of women in sport.  I congratulate Joy Neville on being awarded one of the People of the Year awards.  It is great to see young women being able to reach the pinnacle of their careers, whether it is Katie Taylor, Katie Walsh, Joy Neville or whoever.  It is fantastic and I support any initiative we can undertake to encourage women's participation in sport.  <\/p> <p>Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of school accommodation.  I am not familiar with the particular issues they raised in terms of the specific schools but the refurbishment of schools is something the Government is committed to.  If I may educate some of the Members of the House who come in making statements - I am not sure what kind of research they do - in 2017, the Government spent half of what the Fianna F&aacute;il Government spent in 2008 on rented prefabs.  We are planning for the future.  That is why we have seen the announcement of new schools and &euro;8.4 billion in a school building programme.

To be fair, Senator Warfield outlined to me before today that he was going to raise the matter.  I was in touch with the Department.  A number of technical drafting issues have come to light in respect of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The implications of these issues are being explored by officials in the Department and the Office of the Attorney General and clarification on whether primary legislation is required to resolve these issues is being sought.<\/p> <p>In the event that primary legislation is required, the Minister will seek this as a matter of urgency.  I ask Senator Warfield to give the Minister a bit more time to come back to us on the matter.  I have flagged the matter with the Department because it is a very important one.  As the Senator has said, there are people affected by this delay.  As I have outlined to the House, there are issues that need to be addressed and more time is required in regard to the matter. I would be happy to come back to the House again with the Minister at a later date.

Senators Kieran O'Donnell and Lombard raised the issue of the connectivity in the context of Shannon Airport.  I congratulate the airport on its New York Stewart International Airport daily flight.  As Senator Lombard rightly said, those of us in the southern capital of Cork have been disproportionately affected by Norwegian Air's decision.  I have written to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting that the DAA come to the committee to explain why Cork Airport lost out in this case.  As Senator Kieran O'Donnell rightly said, it is about having a structured debate around our aviation policy in the future whereby we do not allow everything to happen in Dublin and where the growth is not just centred around Dublin but that both Cork and Shannon can be seen to grow exponentially as well.  I would be happy to have that debate with the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>If Senator Warfield would allow me to have the Minister come back to me again with an update rather than divide the House on a very important issue, I would be happy to come back to him.

In March, the Bill completed its passage through the D&aacute;il, following positive and constructive engagement with Deputies.  There was cross-party support for the Bill and cross-party collaboration on a number of amendments which have strengthened the Bill and resulted in the text we now have before us.  I look forward to working with Senators to examine the Bill further over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>The cost of childcare places a huge financial burden on many families, especially on parents who are trying to get out of poverty, or who want to take up job opportunities or take part in education but who cannot afford to do so because of the financial barrier of childcare fees.  The high cost of childcare is also a barrier to the participation of young children in high quality early care and education, which we know from international research can make a lasting difference to children&rsquo;s life chances.<\/p> <p>Making childcare more affordable for families will bring many benefits.  It will improve outcomes for children.  It will also support parents to transition from welfare to employment and support lifelong learning for parents.  It will advance gender equality, supporting women's labour market participation and helping to close the gender pay gap.  It will also help to tackle child poverty and support economic growth.  These benefits are why I am so proud of the progress we have already made in making childcare more affordable, and why the Bill is so important.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides the legislative underpinning for a new affordable childcare scheme, which will replace all existing targeted childcare subvention schemes with a single, streamlined scheme.  It is a scheme that will provide the framework for sustainably increasing public investment in childcare over the years ahead.  The scheme will make childcare more affordable for parents by providing subsidies which will be paid on the parents' behalf to their chosen registered childcare provider.  The provider must use the subsidy to offset the fees it charges.<\/p> <p>The scheme will provide income-related financial support, which targets support towards parents who face the greatest financial difficulty in affording childcare.  It will also provide non-income related, or universal, financial support, which allows a level of support for all parents of children of a prescribed age who use registered childcare services.  The Bill also allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for childcare on the grounds of child development or child welfare.  It names five statutory bodies that may make referrals for free or additional childcare support.  This, for me, is one of the most important aspects of the Bill, intended to help ensure we can meet the needs of the most vulnerable children and of families that may be a long way from participation in the labour market and that would otherwise benefit from only limited childcare support.<\/p> <p>The Bill marks the first time that any of our childcare funding schemes will have a statutory basis.  The Bill is critical for good governance in a number of ways.  It will establish clear eligibility and scheme rules, it will create clear procedures, including an appeals process, and it will ensure the Department and the scheme administrator have adequate powers to ensure that public funds are being used efficiently and to take action where public funds are misused.  Crucially, the Bill will enable the introduction of a streamlined, automated income-assessment process, providing a statutory basis for data sharing between the scheme administrator, the Revenue Commissioners, and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This new income assessment process will allow the targeting of childcare supports towards those with the greatest need, in particular families seeking to enter the labour market but that have a low or moderate level of income.  It will also allow us to move away from the current reliance on social welfare payments and medical cards as the only means of assessing financial need for childcare.  It will be quite monumental when we get to that point and will impact everyone positively, providers as well as families.<\/p> <p>The IT-driven approach at the heart of the affordable childcare scheme will also improve administrative efficiency and streamline the application and registration procedures for parents and childcare service providers.  My goal is the creation of a world-class system that is user-friendly for parents, efficient for childcare providers, and excellent value for money for the public Exchequer and society.  While I am keen to introduce the scheme as soon as possible, the IT system required is complex and I want to be sure it is robust and long-lasting.  The development of the IT system, which is being carried out in close co-operation with the office of the chief information officer, is well under way.  A request for tenders for the IT development was published in January and the evaluation process is ongoing at present.  Earlier delays regarding the IT system are, indeed, regrettable.  However, the improvements I introduced last September involving the introduction of a universal childcare subsidy for all children under three years of age and increases of up to 50% in the value of existing childcare subsidies mean that more than 71,000 children and their families are already benefitting from increased childcare subsidies.  These important measures allowed me to fast-track many of the benefits of the affordable childcare scheme without compromising on the rigour and time needed to develop and launch this landmark new scheme.<\/p> <p>An important aspect of the Bill, and one that has so far been underestimated, is its importance for raising quality standards in childcare.  We know that childcare must be of high quality if it is to improve outcomes for children.  While the primary focus of the affordable childcare scheme is affordability, the approach embodied by the scheme reflects the international evidence that supply-side funding gives the Government greater leverage to improve quality standards than demand-side approaches such as tax credits.  It does this in several ways.  The Bill limits participation in the scheme to childcare providers registered with Tusla, including registered childminders, providing assurance that critical quality standards must be met by all providers in the scheme.  All childcare providers who wish to participate in the scheme will have to sign a contract with the Department.  Section 8 of the Bill allows quality conditions to be specified in the contract that are more rigorous than those required by the early years services regulations.  The Bill allows for future development of the scheme, with section 13 allowing the possibility of quality-raising incentives to be built into the formula for determining how much funding the scheme provides.  More broadly, the flexibility of the Bill allows us to change the subsidy rates over time, enabling the Government to adjust the scheme in response to the findings of the independent review of the cost of quality childcare, as well as in response to the ongoing professionalisation of the early years workforce.<\/p> <p>If we are to support the move to a professional workforce with wages and working conditions that reflect the importance of the work carried out by early years educators, inevitably the cost of delivering childcare will rise over the years ahead.  Subsidy rates will, therefore, also have to rise if childcare is to remain affordable to parents.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Finally, by requiring all participating childcare providers to register with Tusla, I am very aware of the historical anomaly that school-age childcare remains unregulated.  To address this anomaly, I announced last December that I would introduce regulations later in 2018 in advance of the childcare scheme's introduction to enable school-age childcare services to register with Tusla and, thus, participate in the scheme.  In the first instance, these new regulations will be limited to registration requirements.  Work will then commence on the drafting of full regulations that will cover quality issues such as qualification requirements.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the Bill itself.  Senators will recall that I published the heads of a Bill and general scheme in January 2017.  In February 2017, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs carried out pre-legislative scrutiny.  The recommendations made by the committee were very useful and have helped to shape the Bill that I am presenting today.  During the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il, a number of important amendments were made.  I greatly appreciate the positive contribution of Deputies from all parties who worked together with me on those amendments.<br\/><br\/>In setting out the main provisions of the Bill, I will briefly highlight some of the key amendments that have been made since the Bill was published.  Section 1 provides definitions of key terms.  In particular, it ties the definition of &quot;childcare services provider&quot; to the list of registered providers maintained by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Throughout the Bill, the term &quot;childcare services provider&quot; therefore includes registered childminders.  The definition of &quot;parent&quot; in the Bill includes a person acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>and, therefore, includes guardians.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme which will be funded out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas each year and states that the scheme will be operated by the scheme administrator.  Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, provide for the appointment of the scheme administrator and describe its functions and governance arrangements.  Section 6 allows for the scheme administrator to outsource certain functions while retaining responsibility for administration of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 sets out the eligibility criteria for parents seeking to apply for financial support under the scheme.  The residency requirements allow for applications not only from parents who are ordinarily resident in the State, but also from EU and EEA citizens who are not resident in the State and from other categories of parents who are formerly employed or self-employed in the State.  However, financial support will be limited to childcare services registered under the Child Care Act 1991, and these must be located in the State.  Where parents are separated, section 7 allows both parents to receive financial support, but each parent may only receive support for the days or times that he or she has care of the child.  Section 8 limits participation in the scheme to &quot;approved&quot; childcare services providers, which must be registered with the Child and Family Agency and also have signed a contract with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to participate in the scheme.  As such, I assure Senators that the wording of the Bill provides that registered childminders will be able to take part in the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 specifies the process by which parents may make applications for financial support, including the information they must provide.  When applications are for income-related financial support, in most cases the income-data will be gathered through an automated process involving the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Income data will be gathered with the consent of the applicant and on the basis of PPS numbers supplied by the applicant.  The Bill allows for the maximum number of hours of income-related financial support to vary depending on the parents' participation in the labour market.  As a result, section 10 requires employers, education and training providers to verify information provided by an applicant on his or her labour market status when asked to do so by the scheme administrator.  Section 11 provides for the income-assessment process, which must use the definitions of &quot;income&quot; and &quot;allowable deduction&quot; in Schedule 1.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 specifies the information that the scheme administrator must provide to the applicant after determining the amount of financial support, if any, for which the applicant qualifies.  It also stipulates that a determination may be valid for 12 months at most, after which the application must be renewed.  Section 13 provides for the calculation by the scheme administrator of the amount of financial support for which an applicant qualifies and sets out the factors to which the Minister must have regard when making regulations on the calculation of financial support.  Amendments made to section 13 in the D&aacute;il require the Minister, when making regulations on the number of hours of childcare to be subsidised, to have regard to parents' availability to care for a child, and also to have regard to transition periods between work and study, namely, those brief but crucial bridging periods before a parent's employment, self-employment or study commences or after it ends.<br\/><br\/>Section 14 allows for additional support where there is an identified need for childcare on grounds of child development or child welfare.  It builds on existing arrangements under the administrative schemes being replaced.  Additional support may take the form of higher rates of payment, such as the provision of childcare at no cost to parents, or additional hours of financial support each week, or provision of financial support for children who would otherwise be too young or too old to participate in the scheme.  This section allows for agreements between the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and certain statutory bodies.  These agreements will set out the procedures by which those statutory bodies may refer children for additional childcare support as well as the additional support to be provided.  An amendment made to section 14 in the D&aacute;il requires the Minister and statutory bodies, when making those agreements, to have regard to the objective of stability for children attending childcare services.<br\/><br\/>Schedule 2 lists the relevant statutory bodies and the purposes for which they may make referrals.  An amendment to Schedule 2 of the Bill strengthened the wording regarding the purpose of referrals for childcare support from Tusla, which will be a key source of referrals for families in need of additional care.  Section 15 provides for procedures relating to the payment of financial support to approved childcare service providers and for conditions to be prescribed in respect of those payments.  Section 16 requires an applicant to notify the scheme administrator if he or she is no longer eligible for financial support under the scheme or if he or she ceases work or study.  Section 17 allows for parents and childcare services providers to request reviews of decisions made by the scheme administrator.  In cases where an application has been assessed through an automated process, a review allows a parent to request an administrative officer to examine the application.  A review is the first stage of the appeals process.  This section also allows the scheme administrator to carry out reviews on its own initiative, for instance to verify information provided by a parent or by a childcare service provider.<br\/><br\/>Sections 18 and 19 allow for the appointment of authorised officers who may enter the premises of childcare service providers in order to examine attendance records, financial records and other documents relevant to the scheme to ensure the proper use of public funds.  Section 20 establishes the appeals process which follows completion of the review process under section 17.  The Minister's consent is required for the appointment of appeals officers who will be required to be independent in the performance of their functions.  Parents and childcare service providers will also have recourse to the Ombudsman and to the High Court on a point of law.  Section 21 allows the scheme administrator to recover money from parents and from childcare services providers, both in cases of fraud or misrepresentation and in cases of overpayment.<br\/><br\/>Section 22 amends the Child Care Act 1991 to address issues arising from the regulation of school-age childcare which, as I stated earlier, will commence in 2018 in order to allow school-age providers to take part in the scheme from the outset.  The amendments to the Child Care Act clarify the purpose of school-age childcare and ensure that the definition of &quot;school-age service&quot; covers services for children up to the age of 15.  The amendments also set a limit on the number of school-age children for whom a childminder can care while remaining exempt from the requirement to register with Tusla.  These amendments also set a limit on the number of school-age children for whom a childminder can care while, again, remaining exempt from the requirement to register with Tusla.  I stress that these amendments are an immediate necessity to enable the registration of school-age childcare services in advance of the introduction of the scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, at the same time, I will be advancing an action plan on childminding which I intend to publish in the year ahead.  This plan will build on the recommendations of the working group on the childminding sector, which published its report in March.  The action plan will set out reforms and supports to provide a pathway for a progressive increase in the number of registered childminders over the years ahead.  This is consistent with my broader policy goal to continually drive quality improvement across the early years sector, including by supporting ever-growing numbers of childminders to come within the scope of regulation.<\/p><p>Section 23 amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to refer to the affordable childcare scheme as a &ldquo;relevant purpose&rdquo; for which specified bodies may share information on the basis of a PPS number.  This amendment will allow the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to transfer information on an applicant&rsquo;s income to the scheme administrator on the basis of the PPS number provided by someone who applies for income-related financial support.<\/p><p>Section 24 allows for the sharing of data between the bodies named in Schedule 3 for specified purposes, which include assessing an applicant&rsquo;s income, registering a child, making payments, verifying children&rsquo;s attendance, and carrying out a review, an appeal or the prosecution of an offence.<\/p><p>Section 25 describes the regulation-making powers under the Act.  Following an amendment made in the D&aacute;il, section 26 requires a review of the scheme to begin 12 months after the first payments under the scheme are made.<\/p><p>Section 27 allows beneficiaries of the existing administrative schemes to continue receiving the same level of financial support for a transitional period after those schemes are replaced by the new scheme.  This would arise in circumstances where existing beneficiaries choose not to move over to the new scheme.<\/p><p>Section 28 provides for expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the scheme to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 29 creates sanctions for persons guilty of offences under the Act.  Section 30 allows commencement of different provisions of the Act at different times.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the views of the Members of the Seanad and to working with them to formulate the best possible legislation to help families to access affordable, quality childcare.

Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support the Bill and we look forward to it commencing.  Our criticism is with the 18-month delay which did not provide certainty for families or childcare providers.  I am happy that it is now being commenced.<\/p> <p>I am very passionate about childcare, partly because I am in the throes of it as the parent of two small children.  It is a key issue for women in Ireland.  We need to improve the provision of childcare if we are to bridge the gender pay gap, a matter in which I have a great interest.  I appreciate the Minister's commitment to the professionalisation of the childcare sector.  I ask her to outline the additional supports she will provide for workers in the sector.  As she said, their pay is not great.  They are becoming more professionalised and their pay is not reflecting that professionalisation.  They need extra support to provide the quality service they want to and have the ability to provide.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.<\/p> <p>I am also concerned that many people living in rural parts of the country do not have ready access to childcare centres.  I know the Minister is trying to professionalise and regularise the childcare sector, but parents will often find it hard to access.  Does she have any ideas for moving that forward in an acceptable fashion?  As childcare has not been to the forefront of politicians' minds over the years, we are now playing catch up.<\/p> <p>The Minister said that separated parents can apply for subsidies separately.  I ask her to clarify if the income threshold will cover the two parents or will each of them have a threshold they need to reach.  As separated parents run two separate households, their expenses would be greater than those of a couple living together.  It becomes a catch-22 if both separated parents have separate thresholds and it might mean that parents living together in the one household might be disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to make reference to that in her closing remarks.<\/p> <p>The budget will be presented in a few months and I presume the negotiations are going on at the moment.  Is the Minister fighting for anything in particular?  Is she seeking to get extra resources into this scheme?  Is it for the professionalisation of the profession or is it to increase the subsidy available for parents or is there something else on her horizon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#S00200","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to the House.  I welcome the drive, energy and hard cash that she has been investing in our young children since her appointment.<\/p> <p>As the Minister said in her speech, research has proven that access to good quality early childhood care and education, integrated with maternity, parental and paternal leave is good for children, especially in tilting the balance for children experiencing disadvantage.  I am thinking about the 3,500 children living in emergency accommodation, the estimated 139,000 children living in consistent poverty highlighted by CSO in December, Traveller children and children with disabilities.  I am also thinking of children living in direct provision.  I volunteered this summer in a holiday-placement scheme supporting them.  They really are living in the most dire and limited circumstances.<\/p> <p>Investing in early childhood care and education has a multiplier effect.  It is good for children.  It is also good for their mothers and fathers, in supporting them and allowing them to take up training, study and work opportunities.  Investing in early education and childcare also means that Ireland is at last beginning to catch up with what parents and children take for granted in other countries Europe, a matter to which I will return later.  For too long we have been an outlier and laggard in this regard, letting down our children, compromising their parents' ability to get on and damaging our society and even our economy.<\/p> <p>The Childcare Support Bill is a definite step in the right direction.  I welcome that it is putting the affordable childcare scheme on a statutory basis for the first time.  It was very heartening to listen to the budget and, as well as the usual lines we all look out for, having childcare there as a line to look out for, to monitor and to fiercely argue for because we are really only beginning as far as I can see.<\/p> <p>I welcome that a single, streamlined system is being put in place.  Bureaucracy, poor policy design and complexity often get in the way of good political intention.  The affordable childcare scheme needs to be simple for providers.  I remember getting an angry call from the then Secretary of State, David Blunkett, now Lord Blunkett, for being critical of the 45 funding streams for childcare the UK Government had put in place back in the late 1990s.  Investment is only good if it can reach the parts, if it is straightforward and simple, and if it is under good governance.  This is especially so for parents.  Schemes must be user-friendly, as is mentioned in the briefing note, particularly if the Minister&rsquo;s intent to reach poorer parents and reduce child poverty is to be achieved.  I will be scrutinising this and other measures as the Bill progresses through the House.  I may table some amendments.<\/p> <p>I welcome the supply-side approach.  Demand-side subsidies really do not work.  I speak as someone who previously argued for them in the UK, but I was wrong.  The Minister is right in having this supply focus.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the amendments to section 13 when making regulations and having regard to parents&rsquo; availability to care for a child, and the bridging periods before, after and between periods of work or study.  It is really important that we get this right so that the scheme can be workable in real life for parents.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sometimes the policy makers' design is impossible to work in practice.

We are all aware of how moving around, dislocation and different arrangements can affect children&rsquo;s sense of security and well-being, the very children who may already have suffered greatly.  We want to do everything to support them and not make anything worse for a child by the poor design of a well-intentioned scheme.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the commitment to regulate school age childcare.  This was the focus of my first job in childcare in the UK in 1990s.  When we hear about scandals in sports and in scouting it is about time that Ireland brought in these much needed regulations to safeguard children.  Children who attend can also benefit from the affordable childcare scheme.  I welcome commitment to strengthen the quality and availability of childcare with childminding to come under the scope of the regulations.<br\/><br\/>The proposal to begin review of the scheme 12 months after the first payments are made is also welcome as is the commitment to strengthen the wording in relation to the purpose of referrals for childcare support from Tusla.<br\/><br\/>I direct the Minister to a good report from OECD, Thematic Review of Early Childhood Education and Care Policy in Ireland, in which I was involved.  This report was published in 2004 - 14 long years ago.  At the time I was working as an adviser to the UK's Minister of State for Children Margaret Hodge, embedded in the Department for Education and Skills in Whitehall.  I was also part of the OECD review team under the leadership of John Bennett.  I dug out the report on Sunday and in many ways it makes for disappointing reading.  In spite of great efforts and energy on the part of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, Ireland is still lagging far behind our European counterparts with regard to early childhood care and education.  The 2004 OECD report made many sound observations and good suggestions to the Government that have yet to be taken up.  It is a useful checklist for the Minister, Deputy Zappone and her officials and I shall now highlight some key points from the report.  It advises the integration of all early education and care policy under one Ministry; annual targets so that progress can be checked; and, attention to the early years and childhood needs of disadvantaged children, children from the Traveller community and children with disabilities.  The 2004 report stated explicitly that the educational achievement of Traveller children is a matter of deep concern.  It was then and it still is.  Report after report shows this and would be good to hear from the Minister what she is going to do about the early childhood and education gap for Traveller children through this Bill and other measures.<br\/><br\/>Other good suggestions made by OECD in 2004 include funded parental leave of sufficient length; free accredited early education; a publicly funded morning education session for all children from the age of three; and the wisdom, positive effects and cost effectiveness of intensive early intervention.  I would love to see a Sure Start style scheme rolled out in Ireland.  I have seen the benefits of this type of scheme and I am heartbroken at its dismantling in the UK.  We should look to this type of scheme and be ambitious about it.<br\/><br\/>The OECD strongly advised that Ireland should quickly reach the average rate of public expenditure for OECD countries for early childhood education and care.  The affordable childcare scheme will help but I would like to know where we stand now regarding the average spending <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the OECD league table of investment in early childhood care and education.  As pointed out by Senator Clifford-Lee, I would also like to see how we are faring and what we should aim for in the budget with regard to achieving the goal of getting to the average.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister for her drive and commitment to improving early childhood care and education in Ireland and for bringing forward the Childcare Support Bill 2017.  I look forward to working with her to make the Irish early education and care system fit for the modern State that we are, and above all good enough for Ireland&rsquo;s children and their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#S00300","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials to the House.  I thank her for her ongoing work in this area.  I will be brief.  I support the Bill in full but I wish to raise just a couple of points.<\/p> <p>Ireland has come a long way in a relatively short period of time in childcare.  It is in the relatively recent past that the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was appointed.  This showed a focus on children's affairs.  Over and over again, the issue main raised in areas where younger couples live is the issue of childcare.  It is clearly an issue the Government has listened to.  Much has been done, and is being done with this legislation.  I join with Senator Clifford-Lee in her question on the budget.  While not ungrateful for the work done in this regard - and we give kudos for it -  we also need to know what direction we are going and what it is we hope to achieve in the upcoming budget.  This would be very interesting.<\/p> <p>The Government is clearly delivering on its election commitment to help ease the financial costs of childcare for hard-pressed working families.  The Minister would say, and I would join with her in this, that Ireland is building a world class, properly funded childcare system, which should last for generations.  We have, unfortunately, been generations out so it will have to be done incrementally.<\/p> <p>This universal measure is implemented to ensure that all families benefit, which is welcomed, and a further targeted payment will be made to help those families who need it most.  This money is intended to help families who have borne the brunt of one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world caused by years of Government neglect and under-investment.  It is about breaking down the barriers that stop people getting a fair chance to fulfil their potential and it is a big part of the republic of opportunity idea.  The gender pay gap is hugely significant in this space.  If we bring in more of the types of measures that have already been brought in around parental leave - rather than maternal leave - employers will not now automatically assume that a woman will disappear for a large proportion of her career with that particular organisation.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has allocated an additional &euro;20 million in 2018 to support these initiatives.  I am hopeful we will get further significant investment in this area for 2019.  The new affordable childcare measures introduced by the Government in September will continue to be supported in 2018 and into 2019.<\/p> <p>I have been contacted about some slight issues in this regard that I wish to raise with the Minister, and I shall give the Minister an opportunity to respond to them.  One Family and the Children's Rights Alliance are concerned that the Bill retains an intention to means-test child maintenance.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on this.  From a policy perspective we want all income to be treated equitably.  As the Bill stands, could it be said that the scheme acts as disincentive to employment for lone parents? Stakeholders believe that child maintenance should be seen as income for the child, not parental income.  Perhaps the Minister will explain where she is coming from around this aspect.  Organisations believe that the addition of this child maintenance as child income would be an excellent tool to bring more income into low income households.  This will be the outcome of the legislation.<\/p> <p>I entirely support the Bill but I believe there is a lot more for the Minister to do in this space.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in her Department's interactions with the Minister for Finance in the upcoming budget.  That is the only show in town in improving access to childcare and in increasing equality for families and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#T00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Childcare Support Bill 2017.  It marks an important step in the right direction to bringing our childcare provisions to a more formalised standing and to give certainty to a sector, the instability of which has seen childcare costs spiral out of control.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see childcare costs reduced and we believe this can only be achieved through State subsidies and investment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Childcare costs disproportionately affect working class communities, single parents, young mothers and young families <i>en masse<\/i>.  We want fair pay and conditions for workers in the sector where the average pay, only &euro;10.27 per hour, is less than the living wage.  The Government has consistently failed to get to grips with this issue and the Bill does nothing to address it.  While the Minister has stated numerous times that the Department does not dictate wage levels, the Government dictates the standards and conditions that are to be met by childcare providers.  A discussion is needed about the lack of fair standards and conditions for those who choose childcare as a career.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in is also concerned regarding the delay in implementing the information technology system for the new scheme.  I understand it will not be in place before the commencement of the scheme in September.  In the meantime, childcare providers will administer the scheme, which generates additional costs and adds to their workload.  The funding allocated makes no provision for this additional burden.  I hope the Minister is mindful of this and her Department provides the utmost assistance in this matter.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, while the Minister assures us that the scheme is open to Tusla registered childminders, much more needs to be done to encourage childminders to register with Tusla.  Obviously, we do not want a scenario to develop in which the State subsidises people who are not subject to regulation and oversight.  This is an area on which work must be done in the period ahead.  In the medium to long term, the State needs to move beyond simply subsidising private providers towards a publicly-funded system. <br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister on accepting a number of Sinn F&eacute;in amendments tabled by Deputies Denise Mitchell and Kathleen Funchion during the D&aacute;il Stages of the Bill, particularly on the issue of holding a review of the scheme after 12 months and providing supports for vulnerable children.  I hope to continue this positive relationship as the Bill proceeds through the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#T00300","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I warmly thank Senators for their words of support for the Bill.  It is great that they support it, although it does not surprise me.  At the same time, it is important for me to receive their encouragement in respect of the Bill and my ongoing work on childcare and early years education and care.  I genuinely mean that.<\/p> <p>I found the contributions of Senators thoughtful and their excellent questions spurred me into thinking further about certain issues.  In answering some of their questions, I will use the opportunity to speak briefly on our current thinking on some of the issues, which my officials and I may not articulate as much as we may like, including perhaps in the D&aacute;il.  I will also answer some of the specific questions raised.  That is meant as a compliment to Senators whom I thank for preparing such excellent contributions to the debate. <\/p> <p>All the contributions noted the significant progress we have made on the journey to date.  I appreciate those comments.  Statements to the effect that we have a long way to go are also helpful to me and this is a view shared by me and my excellent officials, some of whom are present.  It is important that parliamentarians in both Houses offer constructive criticism as it will support our efforts to secure increased investment.  <\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that the affordable childcare scheme will not be the only vehicle on this journey.  The scheme will replace a number of other schemes and result in the streamlining of financial supports.  I am especially excited that it will offer a way to wrap around the early childhood care and education, ECCE, free preschool programme, our largest early years scheme as measured by funding and number of participants.  While the Bill has been designed to support quality-raising measures, the quality of childcare will also be addressed through other measures, including training, the inspection regime and efforts to improve wages and working conditions in the childcare sector.<\/p> <p>I appreciate Senators' comments, specifically regarding the amendments that were proposed and accepted in the D&aacute;il.  As Senator Kelleher noted, it is not just good policy that is important but also policy that is informed by practice.  The Senator was able to speak from the perspective of her professional background.  Some of our colleagues in the D&aacute;il were also able to use their professional background when offering recommendations on amendments.  We also heard from other sources, including advocates.  Senators referred, for example, to organisations such as One Family, the Children's Rights Alliance and Early Childhood Ireland which work hard advocating from a perspective of expertise as well as the experience of their members.  All of that is good.<\/p> <p>I will now address some specific questions, not necessarily in the order in which they were raised.  I am grateful for the support expressed by Senator Clifford-Lee on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I also note the Senator's focus on women.  She raised the issue of additional supports for workers and asked a question on rural areas.  I am keenly aware that the professionals who work as childminders are critical because many of them have told me that in some areas, particularly in rural settings, centre-based childcare is not available and parents must, therefore, use childminders.  For this reason, it is important that we implement as quickly as possible the initial actions and recommendations of the working group.  As the Senator is aware, I have increased the number of family resource centres and provided a slight increase in support for existing centres.  While there are not as many family resource centres as I would like, some are located in rural areas and provide a base for childcare centres. <\/p> <p>I will address the questions many Senators asked on the budget presently.  Senator Kelleher focused on children living in more vulnerable contexts and those who are experiencing difficulties or harm regarding some aspects of their identity and background.  I am aware of this issue and have already tried to address it.  Section 14, for example, enables us to identify certain categories of children and their sponsors who can access free childcare for such children on the basis of agreement between me and the providers in question.  This will also mitigate or reduce harm in the context of children in emergency accommodation and even reduce the harm of poverty.  I am trying to get access to free childcare for families in emergency accommodation, even in circumstances where they move from their original place of residence.  My vision for the childcare scheme is to ensure it focuses on families who have less.<\/p> <p>The Senator also asked a question on the OECD review carried out in 2004.  She is correct that Ireland lags far behind other countries in this area.  It would be good to use the review as a checklist.<\/p> <p>The access and inclusion model, AIM, takes a wider approach in developing a charter addressing what it means to be inclusive and setting out how we operate in that context.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Department is sponsoring an incredible amount of training of professionals in order to ensure that they operate as inclusive childcare providers and that will potentially have an impact on Traveller children.  We could look at that a bit more.  The Senator mentioned Sure Start.  Naomi Eisenstadt had a lot to do with establishing that.  She will be coming here as my guest in early May.  I am having her meet a number of people for them to glean from her wisdom.<\/p><p>There were a couple of other questions.  On maintenance, all means-tested schemes run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection include maintenance payments.  As they include child maintenance within the income assessment, this scheme is no different in that regard.  Including maintenance payments within the income assessment is essential to the principle of treating all income in the same way regardless of the source and the principles of equity and fairness in the treatment of all applicants.  Another question was raised in respect of separated parents.  Each parent is an applicant in his or her own right and enjoys the full benefit of the thresholds when being assessed for a subsidy.  That clearly answers the question.  Each qualifies for a subsidy in his or her own right for the days and hours for which he or she cares for the child.  Where a separated parent is paying maintenance, that would be acknowledged and deducted when calculating assessable income.  The needs of lone parents have been explicitly taken into account from the outset in the design of the scheme.  <\/p><p>On Senator Clifford-Lee's concerns regarding professionalisation of the early years workforce and its low wages, of course those issues are of great concern to me.  On the specific requirements of professionalisation, I will mention something which I announced at the weekend when I was with the membership of Early Childhood Ireland.  On Saturday I announced our new support for continuing professional development.  We are now going to establish a systematic approach and a structure for the support and formation of an ongoing continuing professional development programme for workers.  We will be employing a person to do that.  For the first time we will provide some training for professionals that will be paid for.  It will be brought to the professionals themselves or the centres from which they come will receive money to support them in replacing staff while they are receiving training.  That is another step forward in terms of supporting the professionals.  <\/p><p>There are two other things I wanted to mention.  The first has to do with the money.  I will reply to some of the comments of Senator Warfield and his colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, who are very clear in the way they articulate a focus on the model of investment which we have in Ireland and on a public model.  Obviously we have a mixed model in the country.  Here is the question on which my officials and myself have been really focused in recent days and on which we will be focused in the upcoming weeks as we work on the early years strategy.  How do we get public moneys to the practitioner and the professional?  That starts to address the question of the focus on the public but also on the professionals and the practitioners.  How do we get the public moneys to the professional?  We are going to be doing a more intensive examination of a couple of other jurisdictions to help us answer that, perhaps in a different way than we have in the past.  <\/p><p>On the budget itself, the goal I have and the point about increasing the percentage of GDP invested in the area, of course I will be focused on those issues.  The question is how to approach the matter strategically and in a way that will get significant investment.  Again, this is something that is happening in the context of our discussions on the early years strategy.  As we develop a draft, we will put it out for a big open policy debate and hear what people have to say on it.  I note the headlines today about some of the conversations we have had in Cabinet recently, in which our Minister for Finance said there potentially could be a big pot there and that a lot of the focus will be on housing, health, education and capital spend.  That list did not include childcare.  That is not to say that childcare is outside of that focus or that it will not be emphasised but I am noting that and I know the Minister knows this.  <\/p><p>I understand the strategy of focusing on capital spend and so on as we move towards a more prosperous economy, because capital spend is a once-off which does not result in a fuelling or heating-up of the economy in the same way as does investment in ongoing expenditure.  In light of my concerns about significantly increasing the investment in childcare beyond the &euro;20 million which we got this year - because, as Senator Noone pointed out, that will not be sufficient for 2019 - I will be asking the Minister for Finance whether there is some way to spend more.  Are there certain strands of spending in which increases do not necessarily fuel the economy in the same way as would increases in other spending strands?  Are there some strands of spending in which an increase may contribute to further fuelling of the economy but in which there is a greater justification for such an increase because of all we know about the state of the childcare sector as it stands?  These are not comments coming from my officials or my Department.  I am asking these questions myself as a politician but I am engaging with my Department in that regard.<\/p><p>Reducing the gender pay gap, which was mentioned by Senators Clifford-Lee and Noone, can be achieved by paying professionals in the childcare sector more.  Most of them are women.  That is a way to develop in terms of that issue.  If many of our childcare professionals are not making a living wage, a fact pointed out by Senator Warfield and of which I am aware, then if moneys going into that sector are increased and more is given to the people earning that money in low-income households, does it not necessarily mean that the income of the household will be raised, thereby impacting on child poverty in a different way than through subsidies for childcare?  I am just sharing a couple of the thoughts I have been having recently in order to begin building my arguments with the Minister for Finance.  I understand the dialogue and the thinking being developed by the Government in respect of the upcoming budget.  I am thinking about where I sit as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and about my absolute and passionate commitment to look for a considerably more significant investment that we have had in the past.  I want to be able to indicate that ambition in the context of the next ten years and the early years strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#U00200","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524043800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#V00250","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#V00275","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524043800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 24 April 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524043800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 4 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Northern Ireland and 20th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement: Statements","time":1524043800,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#JJ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to the House.

Twenty years on, it is important that everyone should recognise just how far the peace process has been able to progress since the agreement was signed on 10 April 1998, but also the path that is still ahead of us.<\/p> <p>The anniversary is an opportunity, first, to remember all that has been collectively achieved through the agreement.  The horrendous violence of the past has been ended and peace has been secured.  Politics and daily life in Northern Ireland has been transformed, as anybody who takes the time to travel to Belfast or Derry will see.  The agreement ushered in a new era in North-South co-operation, which brings practical benefits for people across the island.  The Good Friday Agreement has also served as a key to unlock the full potential of relations between Ireland and Britain, which is so important given the depth of the mutual connections between our economies and our people.  Perhaps most profoundly, the agreement enabled the journey to full reconciliation to begin, but there is a lot of work still to do on reconciliation.<\/p> <p>In reflecting on these achievements secured through the Good Friday Agreement, we must also remember all of those who lost their lives in the violent events of the Troubles.  We remember also the survivors, the family members and communities who suffer still from this legacy.  The legacy of the past has still to be addressed and this requires the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement framework and there are, of course, other difficulties and challenges today that also need to be overcome within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.  Most immediately, the devolved institutions and the North-South Ministerial Council need to urgently operate again, and the Government is working with the British Government to seek a way forward from the current impasse.<\/p> <p>In the declaration to the Good Friday Agreement, participants pledged to work in good faith, \"to ensure the success of each and every one of the arrangements to be established\" under the agreement.  As we seek to address today's challenges, that commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, in all of its dimensions, must be renewed.  The Good Friday Agreement is the fundamental framework for relations in Northern Ireland and across these neighbouring islands.  The anniversary is a moment to renew our commitment to that indispensable framework and our belief in what can be achieved collectively through the agreement.<\/p> <p>Partnership between the Governments, power-sharing between the parties and parity of esteem between communities is what was agreed on 10 April 1998.  The agreement was then endorsed by the people in the historic referendums, held North and South, the following month.  It is incumbent on everyone with responsibilities under the agreement today to ensure that the overwhelming and enduring democratic mandate for the Good Friday Agreement is upheld.  The agreement must be fully implemented, all of the institutions of the agreement need to operate, and the principles of partnership, equality and parity of esteem need to be respected and lived, particularly by those of us in politics.  This demands leadership, courage and sheer hard work and diligence.  That is something that the two Governments, working with the political parties, can and must provide in order to get all of the institutions of the agreement operating effectively and to continue to move the peace process forward in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>As the House will be aware, over the course of the last year the Government and the British Government, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, have worked to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to form an executive.  The devolved power-sharing institutions are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement and they need to operate, as does the North-South Ministerial Council, as I have already mentioned.  Unfortunately, to date it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an executive, despite intensive engagement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Following the absence of an agreement between the two largest parties in the last talks process at Stormont, the Taoiseach spoke to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and emphasised the Government's full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  I have been keeping in close and frequent contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, who I met in Belfast on 10 April and again in London two days ago.  I will continue my contacts with the main parties in Northern Ireland, as will the Secretary of State, and we will meet again in two weeks' time.<\/p><p>We must also work together in the context of Brexit, to protect all of the relationships and co-operation that the agreement has built - within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between the United Kingdom and Ireland as a whole.<\/p><p>As we renew our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement at this time of its 20th anniversary, I have also been placing the focus on the duty to seek a full reconciliation, which was finally made possible with the accord in 1998.  Reconciliation is the deepest part of the peace process and it is understandable that it is a slow and difficult process given the tragedy and history involved.<\/p><p>I want to highlight and commend the many people, organisations, communities and politicians who have made enormous progress to try to advance the reconciliation that is needed.  The Government is proud to support this work through my Department's reconciliation fund and through our contributions to the International Fund for Ireland.  Our commitment will be sustained in the years ahead, as we seek collectively to further the process of reconciliation.  We only have to switch on the news, listen to political debates or see some of the simply unacceptable views that are posted on social media to understand that we are not where we need to be in moving on from the past.<\/p><p>The full promise of the Good Friday Agreement can only be realised through the commitment in its first lines \"to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust\".  That means neighbours living together in peace and treating each other as neighbours.  The Irish language version of the agreement translates reconciliation as \"athmhuinteras\".  Athmhuinteras means friendliness, neighbourliness or connection.  The Good Friday Agreement enables us to live together on these islands as neighbours and friends, realising the full potential of our connections, without in anyway diminishing our identities, cultures or language - allowing for Irish or British, or both.  A more complex set of identities is possible through the agreement and that can only enrich us all.<\/p><p>All of us need to keep that focus on reconciliation at the forefront of all that we do in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland - to seek a connection, and to speak and act, as a friend, or at the very least as a neighbour.  As I have said, there is a particular onus on those of us who are politicians to stretch ourselves and to make ourselves uncomfortable if necessary to try to advance the greater good.  That will not always be easy but it will be needed to make progress with the demands of this stage of the peace process, just as it was displayed at Castle Buildings in April 1998.<\/p><p>There is no better alternative than the Good Friday Agreement to reach the higher goals of peace and reconciliation through sheer determination to bridge practical differences because we are all in this together.  After hundreds of years of strife and decades of recent conflict, we all stand - Irish, British, unionist, nationalist, loyalist, republican or something else entirely - as people who have the responsibility to find a way of living together.<\/p><p>Twenty years ago, we agreed through the Good Friday Agreement an accord to pursue new and better possibilities.  Since that time, we have realised many of them, however imperfectly.  On the anniversary of the agreement, we should remember how much has been achieved by brave courageous people from communities, from political parties and in terms of broader leadership.  We should renew our commitment to the new beginning the agreement represents.  We must take the next steps in our peace process with confidence and determination to address today's challenges and to achieve the full reconciliation that the Good Friday Agreement and its structures make possible.

People often refer to the two communities in Northern Ireland.  I think we need to refer to them as the two traditions and the aspiration, of course, is to have one community.  That is what the Good Friday Agreement promises.<\/p> <p>An analysis of 64 peace processes around the world showed that at the time only 19 were successful.  While there are numerous reasons that most of them had failed, there are common themes as to why peace succeeds or fails.  One of those, which was tragically present in Northern Ireland in the late 1990s, was the concept of a hurting stalemate where both sides were inflicting massive wounds on each other to the point whether neither could suffer any more and therefore decided that rather than continuing the bloodshed, they would sue for peace.<\/p> <p>The analysis of those 64 peace processes also identified the need for an outside actor, who is neutral and able to act as an honest broker.  We were lucky that we had the United States in that regard.  Both sides need to pursue the same objective - in this case the Irish Government and the British Government.  For the first time in centuries, all the stars aligned.  All the actors and all the people and the leadership that were required were in place, in the form of John Major and Albert Reynolds initially, then and Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern, David Trimble, Deputy Gerry Adams, and on the Protestant paramilitary side, David Ervine and all the rest, all pursuing the same agenda.  Even then we saw how difficult it was up to the last day for it to come together.<\/p> <p>Peace is not an event; it is a process and it will go on for decades.  The current impasse can be resolved when one considers the scale of the mountains that have been traversed - bigger than Mount Everest.  Decommissioning, the RUC and the UDR have all been addressed and we are stuck on a language Act.  It is bigger than that; it is an issue of respect and is about culture.  It is about the issues of identity and how two traditions can live in the one community.  That is the challenge that still faces us.<\/p> <p>Of course, we are despondent that Stormont is in mothballs and therefore the North-South Ministerial Council is not in existence, possibly at the worst time with the issue of Brexit.  The most recent House of Commons report on our own Border identified that there are no current technological solutions anywhere in the world that would keep that Border frictionless and open, other than, to quote the House of Commons report, the aspirational.  We are facing a very real threat that the existing 275 Border crossings will be reduced again to the number of Border crossings that were open during the height of the Troubles when 40,000 security force personnel could not keep them open and could not keep them secure.  It looks like we will be reduced to 20 Border crossings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There have been calls for the Irish and British Governments to get together and hold an intergovernmental conference, that in the absence of the parties in the North being able to reach agreement that there might be a role for Senator George Mitchell or some other individual, although there is no one else in the world like Senator George Mitchell.  However, as we reflect on all the things which are not going right at the moment, we must reflect on the last 20 years and all the things that have been achieved in that time and all the lives that have been saved as a result of the peace process.  Brexit is a huge challenge to Northern Ireland.  I fail to understand how the unionists are not pursuing the best outcome for the people of Northern Ireland which is a foot in both camps and special status within the EU, while being part of the United Kingdom.   It would give them the best of both worlds, yet they do not pursue it for ideological reasons.  John Hume had many things to say about the pursuit of ideology for its own sake rather than asking what is the best outcome for the citizens.  <\/p><p>It is interesting that the Minister quoted from the beginning of the agreement, regarding the achievement of \"reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust,\" which as we all know is largely absent in Northern Ireland at the moment between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Expressions on all sides on the cultural issue in relation to the Irish language are not helpful.  Once again, what I do not understand from the unionist perspective is how when one can have a Welsh language Act and Scottish language Act, and police vans in Scotland have \"police\" painted on them in Gaelic, why can this not be done in Northern Ireland?  If I was a unionist, I would think that it strengthened the union, by respecting people's identity as they do in Wales and Scotland.  It is something that makes them British.<\/p><p>If unionism was a business, it would be going out of business because it cannot attract new customers.  Its new customers are to be found in the middle ground, they have been described to me as \"small \"N\" nationalists and small \"U\" unionists\" and are asking themselves what is the best future.  I debated with Sammy Wilson on the radio on BBC Northern Ireland, when I said that we have a vision for the next 20 years and we think it is a united Ireland.  The vision is down the line but it is one we can make; can unionism make an argument of what the best future is for all the people in Northern Ireland?  Will a Brexit Britain be better than Northern Ireland in the EU?  Sammy Wilson had no answer to that.  There is no answer to that because as we all know, Northern Ireland will be the region most affected by Brexit, more than Scotland, Wales or England itself, which voted for Brexit.  That is part of the problem.  The unionist communities have concerns that do need to be addressed.  If Stormont was up and running, we would be celebrating a huge success.  In the challenges that lie ahead in getting it reconstituted, having it up and running again and having the trust back, it needs leadership from the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in but also from Britain.  The stars aligned in 1998, but they are not aligning now.  With the DUP it is the tail wagging the dog in Westminster and Theresa May is largely hamstrung. <\/p><p>The Good Friday Agreement is lodged with the United Nations as an international agreement.  To hear a British Prime Minister row back from the undertakings of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements that Britain has no strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and it is up to the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future, and say it is no longer Britain's position, is a concern for us all.  We know she is doing that because the DUP is the tail wagging the dog.  When that situation ends we might see Britain being more flexible.  The Government's approach in the negotiations on Brexit and on Northern Ireland are positive but the issue of the backstop is very important and more clarity is needed on it.  Of all things that could destabilise Northern Ireland, the return of physical infrastructure on the Border would be the biggest backward step.  We could live with Stormont being mothballed but the return of the Border, whether permanently or for a period, would be a very serious step backwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#KK00200","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Daly.

It can be tempting when we think of Northern Ireland to look at its history.  I do not want to dwell on the political history of Northern Ireland, the island of Ireland or indeed the United Kingdom for one minute.  I had the privilege of being at a dinner held by the Goliath Trust at the Europa Hotel at which George Mitchell gave the after-dinner speech.  Bertie Ahern was also there and there was a live link with Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair.<\/p><p>The Goliath Trust is an initiative which came out of the peace process to co-fund children and young people at disadvantaged schools from different cultural traditions and none.  There was much conversation that night and music over the evening.  That night I was struck by the number of young people who spoke of their disillusionment with both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, who spoke of being let down.  That is not a criticism of the parties, <i>per se, <\/i>but it is what they told me and I want to tell the House.  They said that there was a vacuum, yet they had seen vigilantism, crime and a new appetite for aggressive and unacceptable behaviour in their communities and they felt helpless.  They did not feel supported.<\/p><p>After a long evening, and various events the following day, having met teachers and community leaders, the thing I took away was that they all felt let down.  In his own style, Bertie Ahern said something that only he could say - maybe he planned to say it - but he concluded the evening saying, &quot;Lads, stop the messin'&quot;.  I told someone that would be on the papers the next day, and sure enough <i>The Mail <\/i>Irish edition featured it.  Our Bertie had come up trumps again.  What he said was that the politicians ought to get on with the job that they were elected to do to represent their communities and their people and to show strong leadership with integrity and get on with the job.  That is what I took from it.  As the Minister has said, the Good Friday Agreement is the only game in town.  People want parity of esteem and they also want leadership.  They want the agreement to stick.  There is a whole cohort of people who are totally disillusioned with politics who want people to lead them.  That is the message that I took away from the people I spoke to in Belfast.<\/p><p>It is important that we build relationships and we continue our work.  The Acting Chairman is on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly as I am.  Just speaking to people, socialising, meeting them, travelling North and South is important.  <\/p><p>I conclude by referring to Brexit.  I pay tribute to Sinn F&eacute;in which produced a very comprehensive paper on it looking at special economic status for Northern Ireland.  It produced a paper and that is more than I have seen from most people.  It is worth looking at and taking a fresh look.  The Minister is committed to it, but there is a strong case for a special economic zone for Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>It is a long process requiring patience.  I thank the Minister for his work and acknowledge it in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018041800002#LL00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I had the pleasure of entertaining the Historical and Reconciliatory Police, HARP, Society in Leinster House and hosted them for lunch.
