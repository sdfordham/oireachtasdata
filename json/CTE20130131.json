I am joined today by colleagues from Enterprise Ireland who are present to assist the work of the committee.  In presenting the annual report and accounts for 2011, I will briefly outline the key results achieved.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's mission is to partner with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland's international trade, innovation, leadership, and competitiveness.  The ultimate objective is increased employment and prosperity in Ireland.  The companies we work with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland.<\/p><p>  To help our clients achieve growth, Enterprise Ireland uses a holistic developmental approach and engages client companies across all aspects of the value chain.  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the contribution of the staff of Enterprise Ireland, both at home and overseas, in delivering on the objectives of the agency.<\/p><p>  While it is understood that the focus of the committee's session is on the Enterprise Ireland annual report and accounts for 2011, it is appreciated that members will also be keenly interested in developments during 2012.  To this end, summary updates have been provided throughout the briefing document provided to committee members in advance of today's meeting.<\/p><p>  Despite operating in a very challenging domestic market and in highly competitive international markets, our client companies put in an exceptionally resilient performance in 2011 following three consecutive years of decline.  At the end of that year, total employment by Enterprise Ireland clients stood at 162,692, made up of 141,228 in full-time employment and 21,464 in part-time positions.  In 2012, total employment in our client companies increased to 169,451, with 145,460 full-time jobs and 23,991 part-time positions.  During 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs was launched, containing over 270 individual actions to be delivered.  Enterprise Ireland had responsibility for more than 100 of these actions and we delivered the bulk of the actions assigned to us in the action plan in full and on time.<\/p><p>  In Enterprise Ireland we understand that in a small economy, exports sustain and create jobs.  The stabilisation of employment in our client companies in 2011 was supported by buoyant international sales.  With total exports reaching &euro;15.2 billion, our clients exported more in 2011 than at any time in the history of the State.  The support and promotion of in-company research and development and innovation, as well as collaborative innovation with others, is central to our clients' continued success.  Innovation is at the heart of all entrepreneurship, be it in a high-growth-potential start-up company turning knowledge into solutions or in established companies that are constantly improving their products and processes and thus their ability to compete and win sales overseas.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's annual accounts for 2011 were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 7 June 2012.  As our annual report demonstrates, we support companies both directly, through the provision of financial supports and non-financial support through our client support network, and indirectly, by helping to build a wider enterprise infrastructure through our work with the seed and venture capital community and the banks as well as our work with the research community.  The total budget available to Enterprise Ireland in 2011 was &euro;336 million.  This can be broken down as set out in table 1 of the briefing statement previously provided.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies, located in every county, continue to make a substantial economic impact at a critical time in the State.  At Enterprise Ireland we are keenly focused on our ongoing mission to support companies and support employment creation.  We aim to move forward into 2013 with the objective of playing a central role in the implementation of the 2013 action plan, which will be published shortly.  Notwithstanding progress made during 2011 and 2012, Enterprise Ireland-supported companies will have to increase their scale significantly in the future if they are to continue to win out against global competition.  In this regard, access to finance to fund export growth will be a key determinant of success, as will the composition of the senior management teams and the leadership and ambition of the boards of emerging Irish companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100003#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1359626400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan.

The accounts show income of &euro;343 million and expenditure of &euro;309 million.  A clear audited opinion was issued in respect of those financial statements.  The agency's activities are mainly funded by the Exchequer, with the bulk of funding from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Vote.  Enterprise Ireland also generates income from profits on disposals of investments and seed and venture capital funds.  The agency repaid &euro;34 million to the Exchequer in respect of 2011.  This money was raised mainly from the sale of investments in client companies.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's objectives include the provision of support for the development of Irish enterprises trading in world markets.  Expenditure in 2011 was in four main areas.  The agency provided direct financial support to companies in the form of grants and equity investments.  In 2011, &euro;59 million was provided by way of grants, an additional &euro;57 million was provided through investment in shares and seed and venture capital funds.<\/p><p>  &euro;97 million was spent on developing science and technology.  Approximately three quarters of the latter funding went towards developing industry collaboration with third level education bodies and realising the commercial potential of research, and the remainder was used to develop internal research and development activity in companies.<\/p><p>  Since 2008 Enterprise Ireland has had overall operational responsibility for the 35 county and city enterprise boards.  In 2011 it provided a total of &euro;32.7 million to the boards.  The committee will be aware that, as part of the rationalisation of public bodies, the Government plans to replace the boards with a new network of local enterprise offices.<\/p><p>  The agency's administration, operation and promotion costs in 2011 amounted to &euro;89 million, which was just under 30% of total expenditure.  This related to providing services and non-financial supports to Enterprise Ireland's clients, such as the client services network, and corporate services costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100004#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness"},{"type":"speech","time":1359627000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan and his colleagues for attending this meeting.  I thank the staff of Enterprise Ireland for the tremendous work they have done over the past several years as we attempt to rebuild and recreate our economy.  The statistics and information contained in the annual report and accounts for 2011 make it clear that the economy is being repositioned from people selling houses and property to each other to Irish companies selling their wares abroad.  Great credit must go to Enterprise Ireland and its staff for their success in recent years.  The &euro;15.2 billion exported by client companies in 2011 was more than the pre-recession amounts in 2008.  Equally, new export sales from Irish client companies, at &euro;2.4 billion in 2011, was the highest ever level of gain.  I also pay tribute to the agency's efforts to link with businesses and expositions.  I recently attended the Showcase expo in the RDS, where the engagement of Enterprise Ireland with what have traditionally been small local businesses involved in craft production was very encouraging.  The agency spoke to these business about the potential for their wares to be promoted on the global stage.<\/p><p>  However, a number of questions need to be addressed in order to establish that everything is going well and to find out if there is anything that can be improved.  Given our dependence on Enterprise Ireland to deliver, we need to be careful that complacency does not set in.  In reading the annual report I was struck by the figures with regard to the cost of creating a job.  The cost per job was &euro;11,761 between 1996 and 2002; &euro;4,385 between 2000 and 2006; and &euro;12,024 between 2005 and 2011.  The first question that springs to mind when looking at these figures from a remove is why has it become more expensive to create a job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100004#L00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359627000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Hopkins to address that question and provide some background to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100004#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359627000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The cost per job is calculated by Forf&aacute;s and the same formula is applied to IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  The calculation takes account of all costs associated with grant-giving, as well as income received from sale and disposal of investments over that seven-year rolling period.  This compares with the number of jobs created and sustained until the year in question.  The current year figure of &euro;12,024 applies in respect of 2011.  The low cost per job between 2004 and 2007 was due to substantial own-resource income in 2000 and 2001.  That was a mitigating factor in reducing the cost per job during that period.  Since then we have been earning income from the sale and disposal of investments but not to the same extent as during those years.<\/p><p>  As part of our investment strategy we are examining the cost per job with each investment we make.  That is an important factor when we decide how to support a company.  We want to make the investment at the lowest cost per job possible but we must be mindful of the state of the individual company and how it is operating so that the support we offer meets its needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100004#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Hopkins"},{"type":"speech","time":1359627000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>That is a useful clarification.  The Action Plan for Jobs has played an important role in keeping State agencies focused on creating jobs.  Enterprise Ireland is responsible for approximately 100 of the 270 actions in the plan, which is a significant proportion.  How many of the 100 actions have been ticked off as done and what were the most important ones this year?

The Action Plan for Jobs contained more than 270 individual actions to be delivered in 2012, spanning all Departments and 36 State agencies.  The 270 actions were broken down into quarterly milestones.  Enterprise Ireland had responsibility for more than 100 of these actions, representing one third of the action programme.  Progress reports on the delivery of all milestones were published at the end of each quarter.  Details of all actions delivered are available in these progress reports from the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The fourth progress report is due to be published shortly and will outline a number of actions which Enterprise Ireland concluded in the last quarter of the year.<\/p><p>  A number of significant objectives were realised, including the launch of the second call of the innovation fund for Ireland, the development capital funds, support for a record number of high-potential start-ups, the establishment of technology centres such as in cloud computing and support for more than 200 significant company projects involving investments of more than &euro;500,000.  Enterprise Ireland delivered in full and on time the vast majority of the more than 100 actions assigned to it by the action plan.  The precise amount was 97%.  We are, of course, operating in a challenging environment with regard to resources and I can provide details to the committee on the missing 3%.  We are looking forward to co-operating closely with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the implementation of the action plan for 2013.<\/p><p>  The actions have put an enormous strain on the resources of the agency.

Where EI has overseas offices, the objective is to maximise their effectiveness and they are co-located with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I welcome the opportunity to address this issue because there is a little disinformation going around.  Of our more than 20 overseas offices, 15 are currently co-located with an embassy or consulate, six are co-located with other Government agencies and the balance cannot be located beside an embassy.  For example, in Australia, our office is in Sydney, which is the business capital, but the government capital is Canberra and there is no reason for us to have an office there.  In Brazil, our office is in Sao Paulo but the government office is in Brasilia.  Our embassies are located in Canberra and Brasilia and it does not make sense, therefore, to have us located there.  In India, both ourselves and the IDA have a joint office in Mumbai, which is the business capital whereas the government capital is New Delhi.  There are business reasons for us not being co-located in a small number of countries but we are co-located in 15 countries.  The policy is clearly that first we co-locate with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if possible.  Second, if we cannot do that, we co-locate with the IDA or other Government agencies.  It is only because of business demand that we have a small number of stand-alone offices overseas.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of resources earlier.  We have permission to have a full staff complement overseas of 149.5.  However, in recent months, we have been working with our parent Department and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and we have submitted a plan to increase our overseas representation by 20 posts.  These are people who would be employed in the field, not expatriates who would be sent from Ireland to these markets.  That plan has been endorsed by the Minister and it is currently awaiting consideration by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We believe there is an opportunity by 2015 for up to &euro;250 million in additional exports from this resource, which we estimate conservatively would create 1,200 jobs in Ireland.  We are strong in markets such as the UK, near Europe, Australia, Canada and United States but they are not the economies that are growing fastest now and, therefore, we have to be where the action is.  We have set out a plan that would see us put additional resources into Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, south east Asia, Korea, the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC - specifically, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman - Turkey and Japan.

It is fair to say that prior to that visit not many Chinese people knew where Ireland was.  We have to deal with reality as well in EI.  It is probably one of the biggest coups the country has brought off in recent times.  He started out in the US and then travelled to Ireland and it was an enormous coup.  Many of our European partners would only have loved to have had that opportunity.  We had him in Ireland for three to four days, which gave us an enormous opportunity.  The press coverage of the visit in China was phenomenal.  There is a good chance if one mentions Ireland in China now, people know what one is talking about.  That is the degree of the step forward that has happened.  It is difficult for us in China because, traditionally, the Irish did not emigrate to that part of the world.  The Irish diaspora is not strong in China and, therefore, that recognition of such a visit is important to us.<\/p><p>  We are closely working with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to which we report on trade matters, and that is in great evidence in the context of the work of the export trade council, to which we also report.

There is an integrated plan for the top 25 countries in the world involving all the agencies, which is co-ordinated by the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Foreign Affairs and Trade and, therefore, the left hand knows exactly what the right hand is doing.

In a developing economy, the cost base would be tracked tightly while in a developed economy such as Ireland's innovation needs to be tracked because overseas buyers look at Ireland as a source of sophisticated products and services.  In the past, they would look to Germany, the UK, US, Japan and Switzerland for such products but Ireland is now on that list and, therefore, the companies making export gains worldwide are intellectual property, IP,  rich, highly innovative and dedicated to active research and development.  Innovation is making the difference in the numbers and the capability of the companies.   We are concerned about the cost base, particularly in manufacturing.  One of the things that happened in 2012 was our manufacturing base remained steady and we are keenly focused on that in the context of the lean manufacturing initiative on which we are working with our companies.  There is ground to be made up.  If a company is not efficient at home, it will not be efficient overseas.  We have to address efficiencies in the plants and we have continued to work with our companies on the lean manufacturing approach.<\/p> <p>In terms of the skills gaps, we would have exactly the same pressures IDA Ireland has in relation to the skills.  We would have vacancies currently in relation to computer science graduates, particularly software people who have five to eight years' experience.  We would have gaps in relation to semiconductor design engineers and we would have perhaps some gaps on the engineering side.  Perhaps it is a nice kind of problem to have to some extent, but what we have done in Enterprise Ireland is that we are setting up this year - at the start of it - a small skills unit within Enterprise Ireland to focus on the skill needs of our clients.  We are not in a position whereby we are supporting companies - we are actually financially supporting vacancies in concept as opposed to jobs.  We want the jobs to be filled when people get approval for jobs.<\/p><p> We are working closely with the Department of Education and Skills.  There has been a very good reaction from that Department in relation to the conversion courses for people who had considerable skills in the construction sector - architects, engineers and quantity surveyors.  They tend to be very good at maths and good at maths is the key discipline required to transfer successfully into a career in computer science.  The first of those people are now coming off that - I think Springboard is the name of that programme.  The reaction back from our clients to date is very positive in relation to the quality.  Our view of that is: why would it not be?  These people are very qualified and very well experienced.  They are experienced in business and experienced in life as well because they are not graduates just coming out of university - they have been around for a while, both overseas and at home, and therefore they can add value to the companies concerned.  However, it is an area of focus for us.  It is an area where we continue to liaise with IDA Ireland, with our parent Department and with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100005#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359628200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>One of the biggest problems about which we all hear and know is that of accessing credit for companies that want to export or just establish here.

The immediate issue was access to credit of companies that we were dealing with and which were under considerable pressure at that time.  The team consists of three experienced executives and we work with our front line.  As they are working with individual companies, issues of credit arise in various contexts and the team then interacts with contacts it has established with the banks.  In particular we have established relationships with the three primary banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.<\/p><p>  We have a central contact point.  We have talked about the kinds of issues our companies face.  That central contact point is responsible for helping to introduce us to the individual bank account manager who would be dealing with the individual company, obviously with the agreement of the company.  We would then engage with the bank on the particular issues that might be facing the company in relation to bank credit and the need for the company to get particular facilities.  We would deal each year with approximately 150 companies on that basis.  In some companies there would be a number of multiple interactions if they were dealing with a number of different banks.  In 2011, we had 190 interactions in that context.  Over half of those clients that we would have worked with would have got new facilities.  Some would have got restructured and confirmed facilities.  There would have been some declines - approximately 20%.  Then in some cases the company might have been offered a revised banking loan but would have found it not appropriate to their particular situation.  That is our intervention on immediate issues in relation to companies that we work with through the banking relations team.<\/p><p>  As we got more involved through the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, we realised that actually there were some bigger issues involved - the issues that are common to all companies in the economy, such as the lack of experience in the banks in actually dealing with business plans, cash flow lending and that kind of issue, the challenges there would be in terms of requests for collateral and so on, the reality of debt overhang on a personal or business basis, particularly coming from the property boom, but that is an inhibitor, if one does not want, to the businesses.  All of those are issues that, if one likes, are shared by our companies as well as companies in the rest of the economy.<\/p><p>  As we got involved in the discussions with the bank, we also realised that actually the Irish banking system was not fit for purpose for the modern exporting sector - the modern SME exporting sector in particular, and particularly in three respects.  First, the Irish banking system had not, actually, become familiar with the modern technology economy so software, for example, was a sector that Irish banks would have very little involvement in up to that period of time.  Also med-tech and clean-tech, in other words the new technology sectors, would be areas that they were not familiar with.  The second feature was and is the area of new markets.  Irish banks would have been lending to companies which were exporting to the UK and that was a reasonably common and comfortable area from a banking point of view.  However, once one went beyond the UK and particularly once one went beyond the EU, that then became a more challenging question, if one likes.  Obviously in the recent years where the Irish banks have reduced their overseas involvement, that has become an even more challenging issue.  Third, there were certain products that are important to exporting companies, such as performance bonds, invoice discounting for software companies and similar types of products that again the Irish banking system would not have been familiar with.<\/p><p>  So we have undertaken with the three primary banks in particular, but not exclusively, a programme of work which involves first of all a number of workshops with them in terms of educating them about the kinds of companies we work with and introducing them to various groups of companies: the Irish Software Association; the IMDA - the med-tech association, and so on.  Second, we work with them and encourage them to take on people who actually have experience in these areas.  For example, in AIB the emerging sectors team is a product of that where they have taken on five or six people who have actually worked in software, VC and so on.<\/p><p>  On new markets, we have been working with the three banks, encouraging them to get involved in our trade missions.  On some of the missions to China, for example, there have been representatives from the banks.  They have also, for the past number of years, participated in our international markets week where they have stalls.  The companies can meet them and talk about the financing issues that they have as they are meeting our colleagues from overseas about particular entry into new markets and so on.<\/p><p>  Last and by no means least on the question the Deputy asked about facilities, we have been working with them on encouraging them to think about particular new facilities they might be able to offer to innovative and exporting companies.  An example of this is that AIB has recently got a risk-sharing facility from the European Investment Bank for up to &euro;80 million.  That is particularly aimed at innovative companies in the new sectors as it were.  For us that is a very positive and heartening development.  We are engaged with particularly the two pillar banks in discussions around how they can use the recently introduced loan guarantee scheme to underpin the kinds of offers they might want to offer the kinds of companies that we work with.<\/p> <p> The Deputy asked earlier about some of the issues.  Export working capital remains a major issue for our exporting companies as they enter new markets and try to root themselves there.  Having the ability to offer flexible terms to new and existing customers and having enough money to spend on the sales forces they need to put into those countries are extremely important.  Lack of export working capital is a major constraint on many companies and is a gap in our banking system.  We know our companies are in competition with those from other countries with more supportive banks and government-backed risk sharing schemes such as the export credit insurance scheme in Germany and the Export-Import Bank of the United States.  We see measures like these as being particularly important, a major priority for the agency and our clients and an input into the action plan for jobs 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100006#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall O'Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359628800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>That was a very enlightening answer which we probably needed to hear because I had never before heard of our banks being so ill-equipped in terms of knowledge to deal with an export economy.

People will be concerned about State-owned banks having that kind of skills deficit.

He also pointed to issues relating to certain kinds of products.

We are strongly of the view that there needs to be an improved response from existing banks located in Ireland.  We are also very positive about other banks getting involved and supplying the needs of those clients.  For example, the entry of Silicon Valley Bank into the Irish market is a very welcome development.  This is a highly specialised bank which originated in Silicon Valley that is deeply experienced in lending and investing in software companies and the software industry.  This is an industry worth over &euro;1 billion on the indigenous side.  Silicon Valley Bank has entered the Irish market with a view to providing facilities to some of our companies that have particular growth and export potential.  We see that it will be able to co-operate with existing Irish banks but also compete with them.  From a broader perspective, that is a welcome development.  There are other overseas banks with a particular interest in some aspects of the Irish exporting sector.<\/p><p>  We see it as a need for a richer and more developed ecosystem that includes all elements in competition and co-operation.  The primary banks are particularly focused on the full range of companies in terms of size while typically many foreign banks entering our market might focus on the larger SMEs or the mid-caps.  We think everybody has a role to play.  For us, it is all about the needs of our clients and building up the capability of the various elements of the banking world to respond to those needs.  The launch of the SME credit fund by the NTMA, which is a non-banking solution, is also part of attempts to build up a range of supports and credit facilities, both banking and non-banking, which meet the needs of our exporting companies and the full range of companies in the wider economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100007#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall O'Donnellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1359628800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>In respect of the more fundamental mainstream issue of lending in its purest sense, I know every company is different, as Mr. O'Donnellan explained.

One of our key objectives is to maintain high morale within those bodies.  A couple of months ago, we asked all of the staff of the boards to come to Enterprise Ireland to have a chat about managing the process and to provide our input into it.  The Government has decided to restructure the microenterprise and small business support system and to introduce, in due course, legislation to dissolve the 35 county and city enterprise boards and to establish instead local enterprise offices.  To date, Enterprise Ireland has had a largely financial co-ordination relationship with the enterprise boards.  The relationship will change fundamentally.  We are in the process of setting up a centre of excellence on microenterprise, which we have not had before.  The centre will work with the new local enterprise offices in relation to how they might operate.  The process is advancing apace and three sub-committees have been established by our parent Department to work on challenges to a smooth and efficient changeover.  Enterprise Ireland is represented on those sub-committees and contributing to their work.<\/p><p>  Going forward, there will be a service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and each local enterprise office which will set out exactly what is expected in return for the funding which will be made available.

We have a great deal of time for the work of the city and county enterprise boards and we want to see it continue.  It is important to every county to have local enterprise facilities because they are the main link to microenterprise.  Enterprise Ireland is not that link.

I picked out from Enterprise Ireland's annual report for 2011 that 42% of its sponsored companies are based in Dublin.  While that is understandable, there is a difficulty with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland acknowledging that certain urban areas are getting the lion's share of investment and jobs, whether originating domestically or from abroad.  No one is complaining that Dublin, Cork and Galway are centres to which enterprises are attracted, but a regional imbalance and disparity is developing.  It is becoming worrying.  Has Enterprise Ireland identified this as a problem and does it have a policy to draw investment into areas like the south east which are experiencing unemployment rates of 19%?  There are parts of Waterford City where the unemployment rate is closer to 25%.  It is becoming a major regional problem.  I have asked about how the new EU post-2013 regional guidelines will take shape as they are being drafted over the next couple of months.

The slight majority of our companies and jobs are located outside Dublin.  Unlike the IDA, we have client companies in every part of every county.  It is very distributed.  I will share some of the breakdown of figures for 2012 which I hope will be helpful to Deputy Deasy.  There are 145,460 jobs in Enterprise Ireland supported companies, of which 65% are in counties other than Dublin.  Job commitments for 2012 totalled approximately 7,600, 66% of which approvals were in companies outside Dublin.  There were 97 new high potential start-up companies in 2012, of which 41% were outside Dublin.  The term \"significant investment\" which I mentioned earlier, relates to investments by established companies of &euro;500,000 or more.

I accept everything Mr. Ryan has thrown at me about where the organisation creates these jobs and the percentages, but an imbalance has arisen to the effect that there is more unemployment in some parts than others.  This needs to be addressed from a policy standpoint within Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the Departments that have a role.  I have raised the issue of regional guidelines and incentives with the IDA.  While they may be given to these companies, they are not working.  The IDA accepts that they are not working.

He highlighted how higher education can make a major contribution to the development of indigenous enterprise by pointing to CIT's association with Enterprise Ireland in operating the Genesis programme which has resulted in 200 start-up companies, over &euro;100 million in investment and the creation of almost 2,500 jobs.  Mr. O'Donnellan alluded to the importance of this, as did Mr. Ryan.  The HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are adjudicating on applications for the creation of more technological universities.  If that is where Mr. Ryan thinks the emphasis should be, what role does Enterprise Ireland, with the Department and the HEA, play to deliver on that?

We also helped the institutes of technology fund the professional management of those incubation centres.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.  Unlike the normal impacts of business around there, this industry has been driven from the educational facility.  Also in Waterford one sees the flow of graduates and researchers into local industry and start-ups.  It is vitally important to equip the institutes properly for incubation.  In 2011 and previous years there was a programme aimed specifically at linking companies in the region to the institutes and funding those projects.  This evolved in 2012 into the Technology Gateway programme which was set up specifically to give the institutes the resources to reach out properly to industry and to engage with it.  Rather than wait for industries to show up and ask for research, the institutes actively market the research.  This is having quite a strong influence.

The area I come from tends to get lost as the region is unusual.  I do not have a full fix.  The IDA does not know my county exists but Enterprise Ireland is a little better in this regard and I would like to see its information.<\/p><p>  I had a look through the accounts this morning and last night.  Page 57 details the income and expenditure for the year.  The largest item in the accounts is financial support to industry, which was &euro;194 million in 2011.  The corresponding figure for the previous year was &euro;294 million, so this represents a drop of more than &euro;100 million at a time when one would have hoped support to industry would have been at its highest.  This is referred to in the notes to the account.  The biggest drop is in the employment subsidy scheme.  According to note (a) on page 63, the scheme ended in 2011.  I would have thought that if any scheme should have been continued from 2011 onwards, it was an employment subsidy scheme to support the retention of full-time or part-time jobs and viable enterprises which might otherwise be lost as result of the impact of the global and financial recession.  To see a cutback of more than &euro;100 million under this heading is extraordinary at a time when we need to protect jobs.  One can talk about start-ups and innovation but the most important thing is to hold onto what we have.  I am amazed there was a cut of almost 50% in funding in an area I would say deals with job retention.  Will Mr. Ryan explain why this is and where we are going in terms of job retention, given that there has been such a drop-off in this area?<\/p><p>  I am confused by an entry on page 56 with regard to a contribution to the Exchequer of &euro;34 million during the course of the year.  This is detailed in note 10 on page 68, where it is described as excess proceeds over the amount accounted for in the Government Book of Estimates.  Enterprise Ireland is handing back approximately &euro;30 million.  Ministers fight hard for allocations for organisations such as Enterprise Ireland.  I find it mind-boggling.  The subsidy for employment for existing companies is being cut by &euro;100 million while money is being handed back to the Government.  Could the &euro;30 million handed back to the Government have been used for job retention?  These figures stick out as going in opposite directions and I ask Mr. Ryan for a comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100010#R00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359630600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Hopkins to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100010#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359630600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I will address the contribution back to the Exchequer.

This was to help concentration of the industry.  Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;7 million in the beef and sheep meat investment fund in 2011 and more than &euro;10 million the previous year.  Are we over-concentrating key sectors in the hands of a small number of people in the private sector?  There was a time when we had many disparate co-operatives in the dairy sector.

Given the incident in recent weeks, we must ensure a variety of production facilities to take up the slack if something happens to a particular producer or company group.  Is Mr. Ryan concerned that the scheme is contributing to over-concentration?  Farmers are trying to sell their products to a cartel of two or three bodies that control the overall price.  It is bad enough that two or three supermarket buyers, the Tescos and Dunnes Stores of this world, can dictate prices to their suppliers.

It is working with the banks and encouraging them to concentrate their lending in strategic economic growth areas.  Encouragement is good.  Are the banks doing it?  I am encouraged to see that Enterprise Ireland has held international forums in London.  Many of its client companies are meeting overseas contacts with international management experience and knowledge of technologies.  If Irish banks are not lending, is there an opportunity for some of the foreign banks to invest in Irish manufacturers on advice from Enterprise Ireland?

Is Enterprise Ireland exploring the possibility that such companies could source financing from banks in that country?<\/p><p>  It was stated that Enterprise Ireland had 97 high-potential start-ups.  How does it identify a high-potential project?  We are all approached by people who believe they have high-potential ideas.  They are normally directed to the enterprise boards and so on.  I believe there was a simple rule of thumb that an organisation with fewer than ten employees went to the CEBs while an organisation with more than ten employees went to Enterprise Ireland.  Will this link remain?<\/p><p>  The main issue facing most of Enterprise Ireland's client companies is the level of overhanging debt.  Many may have invested in premises, machinery and upgrades during the good times - the expensive times - and are now carrying large debts.  These debts are not core to manufacturing, exporting and finding new markets.<\/p> <p>I understand the troika is looking at the issue of relief for mortgage holders.  There also needs to be relief for small businesses, many of which have tremendous potential but are possibly being held back because of an overhang of debt, servicing of which is preventing them investing in job creation.

For those of our client companies exporting to Brazil, Russia and China, the overseas banks, which have a good contact network in these areas, supply more than finance.  They supply strong sectoral and market knowledge of areas, including on what a contract in the United Arab Emirates means, because it means something different in Saudi Arabia.

Mr. Ryan can send the information on to the committee at a later date.<\/p><p>  I have one final question.  It was mentioned several times that Enterprise Ireland has large investments in shares and seed capital funds.  If I understand the figures on pages 70 and 71 correctly, disposal of investment in shares last year amounted to &euro;24 million and write-down, in respect of diminution in value, in terms of shares still held, was &euro;6 million, which amounts to &euro;30 million.  In respect of the seed and venture capital fund, the disposal figure is &euro;6 million and the figure in respect of diminution in value is &euro;11 million, giving a total of &euro;17 million.  It appears to me that the total cost as a result of disposals and diminution in value under the year under review is &euro;47 million.  Taking the overall total in the accounts, the diminution provision thus far in respect of shares held is &euro;147 million and in respect of diminution in value of the seed capital fund is &euro;90 million, giving a total diminution in value of &euro;237 million.  The total value of diminutions as per the balance sheet is &euro;253 million.  Am I correct that in terms of cumulative investment, there has been an almost 50% write-down in the value of shares and investments in seed capital funds held by Enterprise Ireland?  The figure provided in the balance sheet is &euro;252 billion and the figures provided in the accounts indicate a diminution in value of &euro;237 million.  Presumably, the investments were of the order of &euro;500 million and there is a diminution in value of &euro;237 million, which means the balance sheet figure, on a prudent basis, of &euro;253 million.  Is that an accurate assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100012#T00900","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359631800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the &euro;24 million in respect of disposals and write-downs.<\/p> <p>As we mentioned, we dispose of shares and investments during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100012#T01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Hopkins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359632400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Yes, Mr. Hopkins did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013013100013#U00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359632400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Of that &euro;24 million, &euro;18.5 million was the cost of the disposals made.

That is essentially what happened.  Enterprise Ireland was left to face an incredible position on jobs losses in the sector.  It required us to work on a programme for the transformation of the sector to develop it into an international construction sector with a base in Ireland, as opposed to being an Irish construction sector only.  It was necessary for us to intervene at the level of chief executive officer.  Duke University and Enterprise Ireland put together a leadership for growth programme to assist construction services companies, architects, engineers and other construction personnel such as surveyors to focus on export markets, on which they had not focused for the previous ten years.

I do not know where the links have broken down.  I will spare the political criticisms for those who deserve them.  I wonder where this figure of 100,000 jobs has come from.

Of the European Union member states,16, not including Ireland, are represented through an office supported by the European Union.  It is strange that trade agreements are being reached between Taiwan and these 16 countries through that European Union office in which we have no representative.

The Commission presented its proposal in June 2011, which was updated to take account of Croatia's accession in July 2012.  The proposal has elements inside the multi-annual financial framework, MFF and elements outside the MFF, which are being moved in and out.  There are many moving parts.  If some elements cause confusion, please ask me about it and I hope I will be able to allay the confusion.<\/p><p>  The treaty base for the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, is Article 312 of the Lisbon treaty, which defines the MFF as the multi-annual financial framework that sets out the ceilings for budgetary commitments and payments under a limited number of headings.  There are six headings in the current proposal.  The treaty also provides that the MFF regulation is adopted by unanimity in the Council of Ministers and with the consent of the European Parliament.  Every year the annual budget is negotiated between the Council and the European Parliament within the multi-annual framework.<\/p><p>  The regulation we are discussing today is the overarching regulation.  The MFF as a whole consists of about 75 sectoral regulations covering CAP, cohesion, research, education.  Once the overarching regulation is agreed work will be able to advance on the various sectoral components.  I understand these have been discussed by the Oireachtas committees dealing with the sectoral areas.  There are a number of proposals related to the Revenue side and how the EU budget is funded but we are not discussing that specifically today, but again we are happy to take questions, if the committee members wish to have information on it.<\/p><p>  The current MFF was for a seven year period that expires at the end of 2013.  The yellow slide deals with the Commission proposal, which is probably the second in the pack, and is the latest version of the proposal dating from July 2012.<\/p><p>  In the bottom corner of the right hand side, one will see the figure &euro;1,033 billion, which is the total value of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF proposal in 2011 prices.  It represents 1.08% of EU GNI, - which is basically EU GNP minus EU budget pluses and minuses.  Not to cause too much confusion, there are a number of elements outside the MFF, that are added on to the figure of &euro;1,033 billion.  This can be seen in the green slide, the provision for elements such as the emergency aid reserve, the EU globalisation fund and the solidarity fund totals &euro;58 billion. <\/p> <p>These elements are outside the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, because they are demand-led contingency funding instruments which are allocated towards areas in which funding is unpredictable, for instance, large pan-European projects such as ITER and GMES.  When these elements are added, the total volume in the Commission proposal is &euro;1,091 billion, which is equivalent to 1.14% of the European Union's gross national income.  These figures are important as the main focus of the European Council negotiations is what will be the size of the MFF.  Mr. O'Sullivan will explain the different views in the European Council about its size.<\/p><p> The Commission proposal was for a multi-annual financial framework of &euro;1,033 billion, with a total budget of &euro;1,091 billion.  As regards the breakdown, to return to the table in yellow, the proposal is broken down into six different headings, the largest of which is Smart and Inclusive Growth, for which the proposed figure is &euro;494 billion.  This heading is divided into two areas, the largest of which is Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion, for which the figure proposed is &euro;379 billion.  This heading also includes smart growth elements, including the research instrument, Horizon 2020, the Connecting Europe facility, for which the proposed allocation is &euro;40 billion, and education.  We have included a slide which gives the breakdown of all the different elements of this heading in case members would like greater detail. <\/p><p> The second largest heading is essentially expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy, for which the proposed figure is &euro;386 billion.  Without speaking in too much detail, Cohesion Funding and the CAP combined account for 73% of the total spending under the multi-annual financial framework.  They are, therefore, the big spending areas of the MFF.  The document I circulated includes a paragraph setting out areas of expenditure outside the MFF, which I will not list as I have spoken about these areas.  However, we can answer any questions members may have on the issue.<\/p><p> The table is the annex to article 1 of the multi-annual financial framework regulation and while the latter is obviously the focus of this discussion, the table is the most important part of the regulation.  Apart from the table, the MFF regulation contains a number of largely technical provisions which relate to the rules for agreeing the annual budget within the MFF ceiling, arrangements for annual inflation adjustments, provision for unforeseen circumstances, GNI capping for Cohesion Funding - this is not applicable to Ireland - and a number of other matters on which we can elaborate if members so wish.<\/p><p> What is the current position following the Commission proposal?  The political discussions on the multi-annual financial framework have been ongoing for the past 18 months under the Polish, Danish and Cypriot Presidencies.  These discussions are not about the regulation but about the financing table and overall principles relating to the operation of the expenditure and revenue elements.  Since November, the negotiations have moved up to European Council level and are being chaired by President Van Rompuy.  The first substantial discussion by the European Council, which took place at the end of November last, was based on a compromise proposal from President Van Rompuy which involved a reduction of &euro;80 billion in the figure in the table.  This &euro;80 billion cut was spread across the different headings and I can provide more details if members so wish.  While agreement was not reached at the discussion, the Council concluded that there was \"a sufficient degree of potential convergence to make an agreement possible in the beginning of next year\".  On that basis, the European Council has been scheduled to meet on Thursday of next week to continue with discussions with a view to reaching agreement.  My colleague, Mr. O'Sullivan, will continue the presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100003#D01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359633300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>A word first about the position Ireland has taken so far in the negotiations.  We have an overall objective, namely, to optimise Ireland's net budgetary position and establish a framework which supports growth and employment in Europe.  Within this overall objective, the Government's approach has been guided by a number of priorities.  The first is to have a properly funded and properly functioning European Union with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  As members can imagine, in allocating funding for the next seven years, we are also setting out political priorities.  It is, therefore, important that the allocations fit these particular priorities.<\/p><p>  The second priority is to protect Ireland's receipts under the Common Agricultural Policy to the maximum extent possible.  This is our overriding financial priority.  <\/p><p>  The third priority is the protection of Ireland's cohesion receipts to the maximum extent possible in the context of changing relative GDP <i>per capita<\/i> rates and pressure to concentrate funding on less developed regions.<\/p><p>  The fourth priority is to ensure adequate resources to reflect Ireland's and Europe's needs and priorities in the areas of research, infrastructure and education.<\/p><p>  The fifth priority is retention of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the sixth is to ensure that any changes to the revenue side of the own resource arrangements have a minimal impact on our net contributions.  I will say a word about net contributions in a moment.<\/p><p>  The final deal will obviously be the result of a negotiation and it seems certain at this stage that it will result in a much smaller budget than that originally proposed by the Commission.  This will involve trade-offs and compromises by all member states, including Ireland, and our negotiating tactics coming into next week's European Council must take account of that.  <\/p><p>  I should stress that the Government is acutely conscious of the importance to the Irish economy of European Union funding, in particular given our current national fiscal position.  Negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework have been active since last September and the General Affairs Council, COREPER and the European Council have been fully engaged, as have Irish Ministers and officials in bilateral contacts.  Irish embassies in EU capitals as well as our permanent representation in Brussels have also been intensively involved. <\/p><p>  I draw members' attention to our national net position in a couple of the tables that were circulated to the joint committee to put these concepts into figures.  I ask them to look at Table 10, Public Sector Receipts from and Payments to the EU Budget.  I draw their attention to the bottom row, which sets out receipts and payments for 2011.  The table states simply what we contribute and what we receive on an annual basis.  Ireland's net position in 2011 was a net gain of &euro;586 million.  Members can see the history of the Irish position for every year going back to 1973.  The &euro;586 million figure is crucial to us in negotiations. <\/p><p>  I draw attention to the line in Table 11, which indicates what parts of the EU budget provide the flows to Ireland.  We receive &euro;1.6 billion per annum from Pillars 1 and 2.  The two relevant figures, &euro;1.297 billion and &euro;348 million, are shown at the bottom of the table.  This is from where our income or flows from the European Union budget come.  Of the total of &euro;1.9 billion for the whole year, &euro;1.6 billion is for agriculture.  Clearly, therefore, this area is a key part of our considerations.  <\/p><p>  I ask members to look at a final graph which was, I believe, lifted from <i>The Economist<\/i>.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1359633300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Is that graph in the document circulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100004#E00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359633300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Yes.  The graph has an interesting indicator.  In many of the negotiations, discussion varies between net contributors and net recipients.  This is in some senses an artificial discussion but it is also an important one of which people are aware.  The graph features a line, above which are the countries that are net recipients and below which are the countries that are net contributors.  Ireland is a net recipient and intends to remain so.  The other axis of the graph shows gross national income <i>per capita<\/i>.  As members will note, Ireland is among the net recipients with the highest GNI <i>per capita<\/i>.  This is an advantageous position for us nationally and one we hope to retain.  I point this out because the issue frequently arises in negotiations.  That is our national net position.<\/p> <p>As holders of the Council Presidency we have a number of responsibilities and other priorities to address and we have to support President van Rompuy in securing agreement.  We then have to take it to the European Council, put it into draft legislation, move it through the Council and obtain the European Parliament's assent.  As a result of the Presidency we have a particular role at the European Parliament.  One of our responsibilities next week at the European Council is to ensure that what the European Council decides is something on which the European Parliament would be able to negotiate and finalise.  That is what I wanted to say on our national position and our national priorities.<\/p><p> In terms of the position of the Commission, the European Parliament and other member states, in summary, the Commission made its proposal in 2011 when it proposed a larger figure and it is still attached to its original proposal.  However, it is aware that negotiations are moving in another direction.  The Commission is concerned that the new elements in the budget are protected and particularly the new allocation towards research, innovation and SMEs.  It is concerned also at the timetable and getting all the agreements reached as early as possible because the Commission has a role in implementing the budget.  The European Parliament would have sought a larger budget.  It was also concerned that its rights as co-legislator and its responsibilities in co-decision are not affected by an MFF which puts a different legislative procedure in front of it.  It is seeking consultation, engagement and more flexibility. <\/p><p> In summary, the other two main groups involved tend to be divided into the nine member states which are sometimes referred to as the 1% club, a group of net contributors who have been pushing since 2011 for a lower budget.  Essentially, they want it to be 1% of EU GNI or less.  Those countries are the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Italy and Sweden.  They contribute more to the budget than they get out of it and are seeking to reduce it.  Some are more extreme than other but the UK, with German support, is pushing for an overall amount in the region of &euro;940 billion.  That is the amount they are moving towards and they will be working towards that amount again next year. <\/p><p> On the other side is a group of member states, mostly the newer members and those from southern and eastern Europe, who are particular supporters of cohesion policy.  These are member states which have been pressing hard to ensure the cohesion side of the budget is protected and they have obviously resisted any attempt to reduce the overall size of the budget.  Within that group, there are those who have argued against the 2.5% cap on cohesion and there are other specific interests.  However, those are the two main groups.  <\/p><p> Some of the member states which are not strong supporters of the CAP, including the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden, argue that rather than increase the overall size of the MFF, payments to CAP should be cut so as to redirect funding towards areas where the EU adds value in research and development and innovation.  Other member states, France and Germany, while seeking a smaller overall amount, have not taken that view and are more supportive of the CAP and in some cases cohesion.  That is the geometry we are looking at as we go into next week's meeting.  As it is a negotiation, we will see how it goes.  The UK, as the committee will be aware, has been vehement and public about retaining its rebate arrangements, as have the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria but to lesser extent.  That is the position of the others involved in the negotiations.<\/p><p> We expect, and it is likely, there will be agreement at next week's European Council.  Agreement is not certain but we expect it.  Once agreement is reached revised drafts of the regulation with the table will be tabled for adoption by the Council.  Meanwhile, the Irish Presidency will have to engage with the Parliament to seek to ensure that these texts are likely to be acceptable.  After Council adoption, formally as a legislative item, it has to go to a vote in the European Parliament and we would hope to have that done by June. <\/p><p> The sectoral legislation on CAP, cohesion, overseas development and other areas - 60 plus items - has been moving through the Council and we hope to have those completed by June.   What happens if there is no agreement?  The treaty is clear that a one twelfth rule of 2013 will apply from January next year; funding would continue on that basis.  What that would do in terms of proper planning and proper use of EU taxpayers funding and in terms of the EU reputation is another matter but the fallback is that if there is no agreement we continue on a case by case basis, and the one twelfth rule would apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359633900,"counter":283,"content":"<p>If I allocate ten minute slots, I can allow people back in again.

Currently, the BMW region is at about 93% of the EU average over the 2007 to 2009 reference period.  In the original proposals, the reference period was 2006 to 2008.  The reference period has been changed to reflect the latest data from 2007 to 2009.  We are not sure, if the reference period was changed to 2008 to 2010, whether the BMW region would even meet the threshold because the calculations are relative.  Any decrease would have to be relative to the rest of Europe.  Basically, the problem for the BMW region is that in the current round, it is called a &quot;phasing-in&quot; or a &quot;transition&quot; region as it is moving from a less developed region to a more developed region and it will lose that status this time around.  This is a constant feature of all of our negotiations with the EU Council and Commission.

The problem is that if we redefined the regions, we would probably have a smaller area that may qualify for \"less developed\" status but because the population is so small it would not result in much of an increase for that particular area.  We would be decreasing the population covered and population is a key factor in determining the size of the allocation to a region.  We do not envisage looking at the NUTS 2 regions in this context at this time.

Nonetheless, at this point in time and in the context of these negotiations, we do not consider it to be a runner.

We are looking at what some people would consider modest cuts or cuts in farm subsidies, regional aid spending and an overall cut of approximately &euro;30 million in the EU budget for foreign policy.  Where is that being captured and examined under the current negotiations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100008#J03700","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359636300,"counter":373,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will note, under the original Commission proposal we were heading towards &euro;70 billion and the most recent proposal from President Van Rompuy was &euro;60.5 billion.  It is one that has been subject to significant reduction in terms of the way the negotiations are going.  That is as a result of pressure from the CAP and cohesion areas.  The MFF discussion will only settle the overall figure for heading 4.  It will not go into the details of the individual spending instruments but we have supported funding for initiatives on food security, sustainable agriculture, the environment and gender equality in particular.  We have pressed that if there are further cuts or cuts to this heading that we would not support an across the board cut.  The larger instruments include: the European neighbour instrument which provides funding for measures in eastern Europe and the southern Mediterranean; the pre-accession instrument which covers countries joining the EU; and development co-operation instrument which covers mostly development work in middle income countries.  We have argued that the cuts should be applied to these instruments rather than to the smaller instruments covering humanitarian aid and other items, as we think they are less likely to impact on the poorest areas.  We have a particularly policy line on this.  We have been projecting that but it is clear that this area of the budget is being squeezed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kyle O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1359636300,"counter":374,"content":"<p>We all remember when the farming community highlighted the issues relating to the CAP in their protest in October.

In that regard, the so-called security research, which includes large grants to armaments companies in the European Union to produce weapons of mass destruction, is provided for here.  I ask the witnesses to bring my concern about and total objection to that to the attention of the Government.  I would point out, and the witnesses might be able to clarify further, that two weeks ago my colleague Paul Murphy, MEP, in an exchange with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, asked how Horizon 2020 would work or the current research funding.  Incredibly, in response she stated:<blockquote><br \/>I think it is important to realise that the areas in which research funding is provided is civilian in nature at all times.  That does not mean of course, however, that funding which is given aspects of security may not be used in any other ways, but we don't have control over that.<\/blockquote>My colleague pointed out how two Israeli arms manufacturers, for example, got research funding from the European Union.  I accept it is not the witnesses' business to comment or make a judgment on policy but it is mine and I am saying that as far as Horizon 2020 is concerned, I believe the view of a huge majority of the Irish people should be that there would be no further research into the creation of weapons of mass destruction, which is what this is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013013100011#M00900","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637500,"counter":420,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, that point can be noted.

In an explanatory memorandum to an earlier version of the Council regulation a document points out that while the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund have proven their utility, the maximum amount foreseen under the current financial framework has never been used.  There is a proposal to decrease that but in terms of the experience of many countries, and people in this country, when I was a member of the European Parliament I was involved in trying to assist the Dell workers in Limerick access these funds.  I was part of a delegation from one of the committees that spoke to the Dell workers in Limerick on that.  It was hugely bureaucratic and that was the reason the amount was not taken up.  Rather than cut because of that should the approach not be to eliminate the bureaucracy and make it much more quickly accessible to the workers who need it?

I have, as asked, prepared an overview.  Having presented it, I will be very happy to answer detailed questions.  I thought it would be helpful and relevant to describe the role of the Prisoner Ombudsman and to consider certain issues regarding the context in which I do my job.  The contextual issues are very relevant to the question on which the committee has expressed an interest.  The office of the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman was established in February 2005 to help to manage recognised tensions in prisons by ensuring that prisoners with problems or concerns had an appropriate and effective way to deal with them.  It follows that in order to be effective, it is vital that there is full confidence in the independence and integrity of my office.  The ombudsman role is, therefore, fully independent of the prison service.  It is important to emphasise that the Prisoner Ombudsman is not a prisoner advocacy service.  Our function is to carry out independent, fair and impartial investigations and to make recommendations for change where appropriate.<\/p><p>  The office carries out two types of investigation, the first being the investigation of eligible prisoner complaints.  In order for a complaint to be eligible for consideration by the ombudsman, it must first have been considered through the prison service's internal complaints process.  The complaints we consider cover a wide range of areas, many with underpinning human rights obligations.  These can include,<i> inter alia<\/i>, alleged assaults, bullying and discrimination complaints, regime issues, the prisoner privilege scheme, the use of control and restraint processes, cell-sharing arrangements, the use of spars in safer cells, the conduct of adjudications and the application of punishments.  We are also involved in issues related to the investigation of serious incidents and prisoner transport.<\/p><p>  Over the last five years, we have taken a number of steps to ensure the office provides an accessible and effective service and to build confidence in our independence and the integrity of our investigations.  I can describe those steps in more detail if members are interested.  Last year, the office received 373 eligible complaints from across the prison estate, which level of demand has continued this year.<\/p> <p>It is worth noting that this has been achieved in circumstances in which the office still has not been placed on a statutory footing, although the present Minister of Justice has given a firm commitment to take this forward now.<\/p><p> The Prisoner Ombudsman also investigates all deaths in prison custody.  These investigations help the State achieve its investigative obligation arising under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights by ensuring that, as far as possible, the full facts are brought to light and any lessons from a death are learned.  The aims of the investigation are to establish the circumstances of the death, to examine whether any change in operational methods, policy and practice or management arrangements would help prevent recurrence of such a serious incident, to inform the Coroner's inquest and to address any concerns of the bereaved family.  In the past five years my office has completed and reported on 24 death-in-custody investigations and we are currently investigating a further seven deaths and also carrying out our first near-death investigation.  Clearly, many issues connected to the care and protection of vulnerable prisoners and particularly those at risk of self-harm or suicide are at the heart of these investigations.  My staff are regularly in and out of Northern Ireland prisons and have full access to information required in connection with our investigations.  There is no doubt that this, along with the publication of our death-in-custody investigation reports at an early stage, makes a significant contribution to bringing openness and transparency to the relatively closed world of prisons.  There is therefore significant media interest in our work, and obviously the way we do our work is relevant to the protection of human rights. <\/p><p> Areas of concern identified by Prisoner Ombudsman investigations and related recommendations may have a significant impact on the rights and treatment of prisoners in different situations and circumstances.  Well over 90% of all Prisoner Ombudsman recommendations are now fully accepted and a recent example of the impact they can have is the root and branch reform of the issue and supervision of prisoner medication which is currently under way.<\/p><p> The context in which we do our job has significant implications, not only for how we operate but also for the challenge of prison reform in Northern Ireland.  The experience of the conflict, in which 29 prison officers were killed and many others seriously injured - sadly, that figure becomes 30 when we include the tragic death of Officer David Black last year - has significantly shaped current service delivery in Northern Ireland prisons.  During the conflict the function of the prison service was primarily security-focused, with prison staff reluctant to engage with prisoners in any meaningful way.  It is a legacy of the conflict that the emphasis over the years remained on security and that the attitude and approach of staff did not adapt to the needs of a changing prison population.  As a result, the culture and approach to management, work practices and industrial relations reflect a different time.  The ratio of prison staff to prisoners in Northern Ireland is more than double that in England and Wales.<\/p><p> In April 1998 the Good Friday Agreement, as the committee is well aware, provided for fundamental reform of the substantially Protestant police service in order to build cross-community confidence in policing.  It was my privilege to be a member of the first policing board in Northern Ireland.  The peace agreement did not, however, provide for reform of the prison service.  There is no doubt that over the years the prison service has made efforts to try to deliver a more humane prisoner-focused regime, but the returns on investment in terms of the effort made, in the absence of a serious overarching commitment and plan, have been limited.  It is only now, following the devolution of criminal justice matters to Northern Ireland, that serious efforts are being made to take forward prison reform.  At the heart of those efforts is the belief that while security is and always will be an important function of prisons, the need to deliver a purposeful regime that achieves real change in offending behaviour is equally important.  It is worth noting also that at the time of the Hillsborough Agreement the actual cost of keeping someone in prison in Northern Ireland was &pound;90,000 per prisoner per year.<\/p><p> The second area of context that fundamentally affects the way we do our job and the challenge of reform is the health and social characteristics of the 1,800-plus prisoner population.  In the general population 2% of children are excluded from school, but 49% of male and 33% of female prisoners were excluded from school.  In Northern Ireland there is 6.5% unemployment, but more than 70% of prisoners are unemployed at the time of committal.  In the general population 5% of men and 2% of women suffer from two or more mental disorders, but 72% of male and 70% of female prisoners are estimated to suffer from two or more mental disorders, while 62% of prisoners are estimated to have a personality disorder.  In the general population around 13% of men will have used drugs in the past year, but 66% of men in prison are likely to have done so.  Similar statistics relating to literacy and numeracy levels, qualifications, prisoners taken into care as children and so on tell much the same story.  It is worth noting that one-third of all committals in Northern Ireland and half of all committals of women are for non-payment of fines.  It costs well over &pound;3,000 to process each fine defaulter through the system for their average four-day stay.  The human face of these statistics took me by surprise when I became Prisoner Ombudsman, particularly when dealing with young offenders and when investigating deaths in prison custody.<\/p><p> Following the Hillsborough Agreement, a comprehensive review of the Northern Ireland Prison Service was carried out by a team under the chairmanship of Anne Owers.  The resulting report identified significant and long-lasting problems in Northern Ireland and called for a programme of change and a transformation-of-culture approach to working practices.  It emphasised that incremental improvements are not enough and stated that there needs to be a determined cross-party approach to driving through the whole package of change.  It is fair to say, not least because of the financial imperative, that there is now a general acceptance in Northern Ireland of the need for prison reform, and the Minister for Justice is wholeheartedly committed to delivering this.  The Owers review did not, however, result in the production of a Patton-style implementation plan and has not enjoyed the resourcing and financial investment that underpinned policing reform, not least because its specific goal is to reduce substantially the cost of the prison service.  The absence of the early production of a coherent, joined-up plan with key activities properly sequenced has limited the progress made to date and the return on the money that has been invested in kick-starting reform.  Nevertheless, severance and recruitment programmes are well under way.  A new, more fit-for-purpose operating model and shift patterns have been agreed but are not yet fully implemented.  Additionally, a change team with responsibility for producing a forward plan is now in place.<\/p><p> Some progress has been made towards cultural change and the emphasis of the new staff training programme is on positive engagement and problem solving.  A key objective is to achieve a critical mass of staff in each prison who are committed to the delivery of a rehabilitative regime.  The new director general is determined to modernise the service and has achieved agreement to make some significant new appointments.  These are welcome developments, but the full impact has yet to be felt on the ground and prisoner lock-downs continue to be a problem right across the prison estate.  High staff sickness absence levels have done nothing to mitigate these problems.  There is much still to do and a number of factors are significantly affecting the quality of the regime offered to prisoners.  Crucially, the progress of the work required under the prison reform programme to deliver adequate and consistent purposeful rehabilitative activity for prisoners is well behind what is required.  This includes the provision of education and skills training, work experience, behavioural change programmes, exercise and leisure activities and a wide range of other activities and interventions that can help motivate prisoners to change offending behaviour and prepare for release.  There are far too many prisoners with not enough to do.  This has an impact on vulnerability, drug and medicine abuse and prison safety, and undermines their capacity for rehabilitation. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the prison population is increasing.<\/p> <p>The prison review team has emphasised the need to take urgent action to implement alternatives to custody for fine defaulters and those receiving short sentences for non-violent crimes.  It has also emphasised the need to address the greater delays in the criminal justice system than those experienced in England, Wales and here, and such delays impact substantially on the difficulty in providing a quality regime.  This problem is particularly acute at Maghaberry Prison where at any one time up to 55% of the prisoners are on remand.  The total percentage of the remand population is significantly lower than in England, Wales and Scotland.  I understand that is the position here as well.  It is our view that the programmes of work examining these issues must be addressed with much greater urgency than has been shown up to now.<\/p><p> There is growing political and community support for the delivery of an efficient and cost-effective prison service.  The prison review team has provided a comprehensive blueprint for the change required.  The commitment at the top of the prison service and the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust to the delivery of the necessary changes is not in doubt.  Some steps have been taken to put some important building blocks in place and this is having some positive impact on the treatment of prisoners.  There is, however, a need for a fully joined-up implementation plan for the future and there is also an urgent need to address several areas where a lack of progress to date could seriously undermine the potential of the change programme.<\/p><p> As a result of action taken by the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, there are now no under 18s in our prisons.  This was something for which we and others have lobbied hard and it is a welcome development.  I would be happy to assist with any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100003#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359630900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms McCabe, for that comprehensive analysis.

The concern Deputy Feighan expressed is one that I shared when I took up office because of the requirement for prisoners who were contacting the Prisoner Ombudsman to write registering any complaint.  We have completely changed that arrangement.  Now in the case of contacting the Prisoner Ombudsman, prisoners may use the telephone on their landings to make a freefone telephone call to the office.  We receive the call in the office and take details of the complaint.  We have further put arrangements in place such that we immediately access the prison service internal complaints process in order that we can tell the prisoner there and then on the telephone whether the complaint is eligible.  If it is not eligible we can give the prisoner advice and support and encourage him to do whatever he needs to do to address the complaint internally for it to become eligible.  Then, having confirmed that it is eligible, we can take steps to give it to an investigator in order that an investigation can commence.<\/p><p>  If there is a prisoner for whom English is not his first language, we have an arrangement in place whereby it will be communicated to him in his own language.  Then he can simply ring us and give the name of his country and we will immediately put him in conversation with an interpreter and they can tell us immediately about the complaint they wish to register.  At that stage we will go into the system and inform them immediately whether it is eligible.  Future communications with such prisoners will be in their own languages and, if necessary, our staff will take out interpreters.<\/p><p>  There is one weakness in the system.  Before prisoners can bring a complaint to us they must take it through the internal complaints process.  That process was reviewed some years ago because it was widely recognised that it was not serving the intended purpose.  We welcome the changes that were made.  For example, the process was reduced from a three-step process to a two-step process.  There was a built-in provision to ensure that once a prisoner had made a complaint, someone had to discuss it with him.  Previously we found many examples of where a prisoner complained but no one discussed the complaint with him.  The main thing it did not achieve - we have constantly registered the fact that we believe it is undesirable - was to address the fact that they still require the internal complaints to be made in writing.  If they are struggling, we encourage prisoners to avail of the services of the Independent Monitoring Board, IMB, to assist them, where necessary.  There are some instances where a trusted member of staff would be able to help, but we would rather have a system whereby prisoners who cannot write can complain without having to do so.<\/p><p>  The second question related to how vigorously the Anne Owers report is being implemented.  Is it the way I would wish?  Absolutely not.  People have different views on the Patten report on policing but I sat on the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  When it was published, the Patten report offered an implementation plan.  It was comprehensive, fully joined up, all the necessary strands had been identified and interdependent activities had been recognised such that there was a proper sequencing of the things that needed to happen.<\/p><p>  Given the political situation, this was a little more complex because Dame Anne Owers produced her report and the political responses to it varied.  There was no unanimous view that people wanted to accept the report and implement it.  My interpretation is akin to that of the Minister for Justice in taking the work forward: rather than having a scenario where the Anne Owers report has been accepted, we acknowledge that this is not the case and we now move to see how we can best implement it.  To some extent there has been a necessity to feel our way.  It has been done in more of a step-by-step approach rather than a comprehensive acceptance.  There have been consequences of that.<\/p><p>  We make a point of meeting each of the political parties on a regular basis.  We welcome the fact that over time because of the dialogue and because of people becoming involved in the issues and understanding the possible benefits of alternative approaches, we have made progress in terms of the commitment to reform.  However, the problem with doing it in that way is that in terms of maximising the return on the investment we are making, the process has not been as clean as I would have liked.  We are making progress step by step rather than having unequivocal support and thus having the opportunity to get stuck in to making it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100005#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359630900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Ms McCabe referred to the implementation plan.  There are no timeframes because of the step-by-step approach and there are consequences for prisoners within the system.

Is it possible that pressure can be put on to ensure that the implementation process is time bound?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100005#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maskey, MP"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359630900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We met each of the political parties.  We approached the justice committee and the Minister for Justice.  We argued from the outset of the need for a joined-up implementation plan.  The matter was discussed at the justice committee several times but the fact is that it did not happen.  However, one welcome development has been the establishment of a change team.  It has not started at the time or from the place we would have wished, but given where we are now, it is trying to produce a comprehensive programme of work.  It is engaging with everyone who has a part to play.  It is starting to consider sequencing issues and to put timescales against activities.  Crucially, it is beginning to do proper costing.  One of the downsides of not having an implementation plan has been that in the absence of one, we cannot say that in a given timeframe this is what we expect it to look like, or that if we make a given investment now, then we will get a given outcome at the other end.  Without it, if we approach different departments with responsibility for health, education or development and so on, and urge them to commit to it, it is very difficult to get commitments.<\/p> <p>In my view, this continues to be a flaw in the context of there being serious joined-up thinking right at the top at departmental, committee and ministerial level.  For example, everyone would benefit if the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, which has such a key role to play, adopted a much more joined-up approach.  In the absence of that, those at prison level and at South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust level are doing the best they can to co-ordinate their efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100005#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359631500,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCabe for her presentation.  A group of Senators and Deputies is very concerned with regard to the human rights of certain prisoners in Maghaberry Prison.  The group has made two visits to the facility.  I was involved in the most recent of these, which took place just before Christmas.  We met the authorities at the prison, the prisoners themselves and various groups.  We then met the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, and several other MLAs at Stormont.  We have since made a request to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP.<\/p><p>  I accept that Ms McCabe cannot discuss particular prisoners.  However, I am wondering about her involvement in this matter.  Serious concerns have arisen with regard to the fact that some people have been held, without charge, in Maghaberry Prison for some time.  There are also concerns about the dirty protest which took place at the prison over a period of almost two years.  A number of prisoners involved in that protest developed serious health problems.  How is it possible that someone from the prison was brought to a hospital to have a heart procedure and was then returned there while the dirty protest was ongoing?<\/p><p>  On strip searches, the authorities at Maghaberry informed us that a new machine is being trialled at other prisons.  When will such a machine be introduced at Maghaberry, where there was a serious problem in respect of strip searches?  In my opinion, such searches are an abuse of human rights.  During our visit, I raised the issue of one prisoner, who is now in hospital, in the context of her lack of access to fresh air.  I was informed that she could have been incarcerated in one of the other prisons but these would also have been unsuitable in the context of her health needs.  Some of the health needs of the prisoners are Maghaberry are just not being addressed.<\/p><p>  My final question relates to Ms McCabe's relationship with the parole commissioners and the Minister.  I have never come across a more obvious example of the ball being kicked from one authority to another because nobody seems to want to assume responsibility for these matters.  We are all concerned about the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace treaties, etc., but I do not believe anybody realises the significance of these human rights issues.  I stress the term \"human rights issues\" because I am not referring to the political views of the people in question.  What is happening could really undermine the great work that has been done in the past.  Perhaps Ms McCabe will outline her views on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100006#G00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631500,"counter":471,"content":"<p>In light of the number of issues Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has raised, perhaps Ms McCabe might like to deal with them before we proceed to deal with the questions of other members who are offering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100006#G00300","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359631500,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will begin by discussing human rights in general before dealing with the specifics.  When I was preparing my presentation, I tried to provide a long list of examples of the kind of areas in respect of which we consider complaints in order to try to demonstrate the extent to which human rights considerations are relevant to and underpin a great deal of our work.  That is both in terms of the issues we consider via complaints and also in the context of death-in-custody investigations, where issues relating to the right to life, the protection of individuals and vulnerability are very much at the heart of our work.  In the context of how we approach our work, it is absolutely at the centre of everything we do.<\/p><p>  On the specific points raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, in the past three years we have received a large number of complaints from prisoners in Roe House.  I mention the latter because the Deputy made particular reference to it.  We approach those complaints in the same way we approach all others.  We investigate each one in full.  Very often these are quite complex investigations because a great many factors come into play in determining what is happening, what should happen, what are the restrictions and - there are different perspectives in this regard - what is possible.  In each case we carry out a proper investigation and produce an evidence-based report.  We deal - beginning, middle and end of - in evidence and facts.  We then make recommendations, where we believe it is appropriate to do so, in the context of ways to address issues which arise.<\/p><p>  Where human rights and health care issues arise - we have considered several cases where matters relating to health care have been at least part of the complaint made - we make recommendations.  On foot of the recommendations we have made over the three years, a great deal of action has been taken.  In the past few weeks, in the aftermath of the conclusion of the most recent protest, we have continued to receive a significant number of complaints from republican prisoners.  This demonstrates that there is an absolute recognition of the completely independent and impartial way in which we do our job, analyse the evidence and - where we deem appropriate - make recommendations which are helpful and constructive.  There have been many instances where we have carried out investigations and come to the view that something which was happening was not appropriate.  In such circumstances, we resolved that, with a degree of creativity, there were better ways of addressing issues.  We have been influential, through our recommendations, in changing things.  There are other instances where we investigate and where we arrive at the view that, in all the circumstances, the Northern Ireland Prison Services is doing everything reasonably possible.  When we come across such cases, we highlight them.  That is my particular experience.<\/p><p>  In the context of people being held in isolation and as the Chairman explained, I cannot discuss individual cases.  However, this is a subject which concerns me greatly.  In the case of individual prisoners who have been held completely on their own in separate conditions, I have never received any specific complaints to investigate.  I would have contact from solicitors and family members and I make a point of ensuring that they know what they need to do if they wish to bring a complaint to me in order that I might carry out an independent investigation.<\/p><p>  I make it my business to keep abreast of what is happening in prisons because context is everything when I am examining complaints and making appropriate recommendations.  It would be my impression that, in very difficult circumstances, it is generally the case that the Northern Ireland Prison Service tries very hard to provide the best regime possible.  I have received complaints from other prisoners about the fact that the Northern Ireland Prison Service has made special efforts - on foot of concerns about isolation and people being held on their own - to ensure there is ample family contact for individuals.  The latter can cause great difficulties, particularly for women prisoners, who would dearly love to enjoy the same level of family contact and who feel aggrieved that the same facility is not accorded to them.<\/p><p>  When we carry out an investigation, we try to consider the complaint comprehensively and take on board all of the issues and challenges involved.  What we are always seeking to do is discover whether there is an appropriate and constructive recommendation which we can make and which might be helpful.  I have considered many complaints in respect of prisoners held in the care and supervision unit, CSU, for long periods.  I have clearly stated in my reports - I have also made recommendations in this regard - that the quality of regime we can offer prisoners incarcerated in the CSU presents serious challenges.  I am concerned about this matter and I am currently dealing with complaints from people held in the CSU.  I will be reconsidering the position with regard to what we are providing and making recommendations if I deem it appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  There are circumstances which present real challenges for the Northern Ireland Prison Service, not least where there is massive overcrowding and where there is huge pressure on resources.  For example, there are a great many prisoners in Maghaberry who are sharing cells at present.  Even when there is a real wish to be constructive, all sorts of practical difficulties can arise.  There are occasions on which we also consider the extent of the wish to be constructive.  We survey everything in the round and try to ensure that we make evidence-based findings and recommendations.<\/p><p>  On strip searches or full-body searches, as we refer to them, the question the Deputy posed really needs to be addressed to the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  From a human rights perspective, we have always stated our belief that searching should be as non-intrusive as possible.  There is a major issue with drugs in Northern Ireland prisons.  We have reported a number of deaths in custody recently in which there is every chance that medication and drug abuse may have played a part.  It is clearly the case that, in terms of self-harm, drugs are an absolute scourge with which we really must deal.  Searches should be as non-invasive and dignified as possible, not least because we must also cater for the needs of prisoners with mental health problems and learning difficulties.  We have always advocated that every effort should be made to identify methodologies which will ensure that the Northern Ireland Prison Service can do its job in the most respectful way possible.<\/p> <p> In terms of the Minister and the Parole Commission, I am very much complaint-led.  I would have regular meetings with the Minister, with each of the political parties, with the governors and the director general and all stakeholders, including the Criminal Justice Inspectorate and the RQIA, and I believe we can increase the value of returns of our efforts by working supportively and being knowledgeable about one another's work.  I try to influence the progression of the prison reform programme, and I will explain that.  When I am examining issues such as, for example, prisoners complaining about the regime or lock-down, in many instances I am extremely concerned about the quality of what we are offering.  I am also very conscious that in circumstances where I have a very good understanding of where we are at and what we are trying to achieve - there is a good deal of churn at the moment because many people are leaving and new officers are coming in - that if I make recommendations that cannot currently be delivered, I can create expectations and simply make a bad situation worse.  We concentrate our efforts on recommendations that can be delivered.  We look at what is going on locally and see if there are ways that we can do better.  We also spend a good deal of time talking to prisoners and explaining the reasons for the decisions and what we are trying to achieve through the prison reform programme.  Given that we take that responsible approach, we believe we have an absolute duty and responsibility to do everything we possibly can to push the prison reform programme ahead, to speak out when we believe it is not doing what it needs to do and to try to influence the decisions that are made along the way.<\/p><p> With regard to the Parole Commission, we look at specific cases.  If I get a complaint from a prisoner who feels that there may be issues related to the report that was put to the Parole Commission or that are likely to arise, or about the way that certain aspects of his or her co-operation with the regime or whatever is being treated and he or she believes it is unjust and unfair, in those circumstances we will carry out a full investigation and on many occasions we have made specific recommendations which have resulted in changes to what would happen with the Parole Commission.  I am fully informed about its work but I do not have any week-to-week engagement with it in terms of the job it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359632100,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, to be followed by Deputy Crowe and Senators Jim D'Arcy and White.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100007#H00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359632100,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Pauline McCabe and Mr. George Richardson and thank Ms McCabe for her very clear presentation.

Ms McCabe said in her report that her office is not yet on a statutory footing, that there is no implementation plan and that 90% of her recommendations are accepted.  I would like to refer to the 10% and the quality of those that are not accepted.  More than 70% of the prisoners have more than one mental health problem.

The case of Marian Price is under current review but it seems to be under review for a very long time.  She is being held in Belfast City Hospital in a secure wing in isolation.

I ask Ms McCabe to comment on that, particularly around the points of resistance in the system for the reform of the prison service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Doherty, MP"},{"type":"speech","time":1359632100,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  The treatment of prisoners and their families is a measure of how civilised a society is and historically we know that what happened in prisons in Ireland certainly impacted on wider society.  There was mention of strip searching.  I have talked to prisoners who were totally isolated, kept in sterile areas and had no real contact with the public but yet they were strip searched on a regular basis.  I talked to some prisoners in the past who were in prison in England who were strip searched three, four or five times a days and they would have had no contact with the general public.  There was a view that strip searching was used to degrade and to break those prisoners.  The fact that strip searching is still being carried out in sterile areas of a jail does not add up.  It is uncivilised and degrading for a person to have to undergo that.  Modern technology can overcome the need for it but it is not being used throughout the prison system.  We know from our experience of going through airport security that physical barriers have been introduced where people are searched.  I cannot understood why strip searching is being used in the prisons and it is not only in the North that it is being used.<\/p><p>  Ms McCabe mentioned that this is related to there being a big drug problem but historically there would not have been a huge drug problem on republican wings, of which I was ever aware, yet strip searches are being carried out on those prison wings.  Does Ms McCabe's office have a view on the use of strip searches and their effectiveness?  What has been found from strip searching prisoners, particularly those on the loyalist and republican wings?  What has been found in recent years on foot of strip searches?  Is it known how many strip searches are carried out?  Are there statistics?<\/p><p>  Many of us want to bring about change.  Change has taken place in the courts, the police service, Ms McCabe's office, the probation service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but the last bastion when it comes to change seems to be the prison service.  The lack of such change has a huge impact not only on the prisoners but on their families who have to go to the prison to visit them.<\/p><p>  Ms McCabe mentioned overcrowding.  Is her office concerned about overcrowding, particularly in the republican and loyalist wings as she mentioned that cells are being shared?  Has Ms McCabe expressed a view on the difficulties that are possibly coming down the track in this regard?<\/p><p>  With regard to those prisoners who are isolated, as in the case of Marian Price who is totally isolated, her only exercise is walking down a corridor.  She has no access to an outdoor area or to the sun, rain or snow.  She is isolated because she is a special case because of her medical condition.  The fact that in this day and age we can still isolate people in this way, people who are seriously ill, says a lot about the society that allows that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100007#H00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359632100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I will start with the overcrowding issue because it also relates to what Mr. Doherty asked about the prison reform process.  I should say, for the purposes of clarification, that there are no republican prisoners sharing cells in case I misled the Mr. Doherty in any way because he made that comment.  It is in the integrated population that prisoners are sharing.<\/p> <p>On the issue of overcrowding, which sits with the issue of why we are where we are with prisoner reform, some of it comes back to the level of political priority that it is given.  We recognise that, being brutal, the public in Northern Ireland at the moment is interested in a whole ream of things, and prisons and prisoners are low down the list.  There are not many jurisdictions where it is much different.  One of the things we have been keen to do in the past five years is to encourage public debate.  It would be entirely fair to say that the publication of our death-in-custody investigations have achieved much media coverage and have opened up all sorts of debates that had not taken place previously where people started to think more about what happens in prisons, what we are trying to achieve and what comes out of prison.  Those things are helpful but we have a long way to go.  There must be an absolute will to do it.  Sometimes those in offices such as mine feel that they work and fight incredibly hard for what is achieved.<\/p><p> I wish to respond to the question on overcrowding.  I made the point earlier, and I feel incredibly strongly about this, that we have had the three major problems for a long time, and sometimes I get incredibly frustrated at how long it takes to change things.  We are still sending fine defaulters to prison.  Everyone in Northern Ireland - all the political parties - are aware that we are sending fine defaulters to prison.  We are now into our second if not third pilot study to find out what we are going to do about sending such people to prison.  Everyone everywhere knows it is an utter and total waste of time and money and that there are much more effective ways of dealing with fine default.  It is one third of all committals across the prison estate and it is one half of women prisoners.  In one year in which a report was carried out, one woman went to prison for non-payment of a dog licence.  This is in circumstances where prisons are trying to deliver a prison reform programme, with limited resources and limited money, and we are trying to support their efforts.  In excess of &pound;3,000 is required for every single one of those committals and it is achieving nothing in terms of the overall objective.<\/p><p> The second area of difficulty relates to delays in the criminal justice system.  When I was on the policing board ten years ago, we got the first report from the criminal justice inspector about delays in the criminal justice system.  Ten years on, it has not changed one jot.  The prison is still stuffed with people on remand who, as has rightly been said, might be found innocent.  Prisoners on remand are in prison for far too long.  Again, that has a massive impact.  It also has a massive impact on the task of reform because of what one can do with remand prisoners versus what one can do with prisoners who have been committed.  All sorts of issues must be confronted.<\/p><p> The third crucial issue on which there has been much recent debate is people serving short sentences for non-violent crimes.  The committee had a presentation recently on restorative justice.  In Northern Ireland, the performance of the restorative youth justice and probation service is rather good.  We know for sure that it can work if we invest properly and manage properly community disposal so that it is individually needs-driven and the package contains restorative justice where appropriate and community service where appropriate.  We examine mental health issues, addiction issues, finance issues, housing issues and family support issues.  We know that if we effectively deal with those issues and address them, we can achieve a much better chance of someone not re-offending than if we send them to prison.  All of those things are contributing massively to overcrowding.  My view is that it is completely within our gift to deal with those matters, if the political will exists to do it.  The justice Minister is really pushing forward pieces of work to try to achieve change but it does sometimes feel as if it takes a very long time.<\/p><p> Mr. Doherty asked me about the parole commission.  I do not feel that I can helpfully answer those questions.  In my experience, every case is different.  Each time we get a case, we go to great pains to look at every aspect of it that is relevant.  We do a factual, evidence-based, objective and impartial report with appropriate recommendations, but I must have a complaint in order to be able to investigate it.  In my experience, to comment on any case where one has not had a chance to do the investigation oneself and look at all of the evidence is generally not helpful.  I fully understand the issues that are being raised.  They are questions that must be put to others.  Where I get a complaint I am very zealous about investigating it.<\/p><p> On full body searching, I will first come back to the comments made about the drugs problem.  The point was made that republican prisoners are rarely if ever found with drugs.  Whenever we look at the issue, we speak to the prisoners and the prison service, and we look at all of the relevant issues.  One of the difficulties the prison service will express, which we understand, is that even though republican prisoners say they do not use drugs and the evidence might support that, they also do not co-operate with drugs testing.  The problem they face is that if it was acceptable for a group of prisoners to say they do not use drugs but they will not co-operate with drugs testing then, arguably, any other group within the prison could say the same and this would give rise to all sorts of issues relating to the treatment of different groups.  There are prisoners who can remain drugs-free for a period in order to create a situation where subsequently they might have the ability to use drugs or get other people to bring in drugs.  That argument is often used.  I fully understand why people feel that it might seem unjust but it does have wider implications in terms of the total prison population.  The extent to which drugs, medicine abuse and bullying underpin efforts to try to rehabilitate and create a purposeful regime cannot be exaggerated.  I would put it high on the list of priorities to be tackled robustly.<\/p><p> Against that, I cannot emphasise too strongly that we should do everything we humanly can to make sure that searches are as least intrusive as possible.  It is appropriate for me to mention that at one stage some time ago I did get a number of reports from republican prisoners about full body searching.  We investigated them fully and we looked at the relevant CCTV footage.  As a result of the investigation we found that the searches were being carried out broadly in compliance with prison service policy.  Republican prisoners say that carrying them out in compliance with prison service policy still constitutes physical abuse and sexual abuse.  We acknowledge everyone&rsquo;s position and point of view in our reports.  What we did see is that the manner in which the searches were carried out, the quality of communication, respectfulness and everything else meant that there were better and less preferable ways of carrying out full body searching.  We made a series of recommendations on foot of those reports that we should always apply prison service policy in line with best practice and what the best people were doing.  They were fully accepted and a number of changes were made at the time to make sure that the recommendations were consistently applied.  It does not change the facts and I fully understand the principle Deputy Crowe made that some people believe there should not be searches.  My aim in terms of the wider picture is to find a technological solution that could detect drugs being brought in under any circumstances.  That would be the ideal scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100007#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359632700,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Is Ms McCabe saying that the reason republican prisoners are being searched is to find drugs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100008#J00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359632700,"counter":480,"content":"<p>No, I am not saying that at all.

Deputy Crowe put forward the point of view that one of the reasons people are subject to full body searches in prison as a whole relates to the movement of drugs.  The point was made that republican prisoners say that they do not use drugs in prison, which is supported by the evidence.  All I was saying is that when we do our investigations and look at the various arguments that are put forward, one of the arguments put forward by the prison service, which I understand, is that if one accepts that one group should not be searched, then there could be many circumstances where one should extend the argument to other groups.<\/p> <p>I also made the point that because republican prisoners, for reasons I understand, do not engage in testing, it creates a doubly difficult situation in terms of equality where others say they do not use drugs and they will not be tested.  That would create various difficulties in terms of equality of treatment and would have the potential to undermine the prison's position in some situations to prevent drugs being brought into prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359633300,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Regarding strip searching and internal body searching-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359633300,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy say \"internal body searching\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1359633300,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Yes, internal body searching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K00400","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359633300,"counter":485,"content":"<p>To be absolutely clear, there is no internal body searching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1359633300,"counter":486,"content":"<p>None whatsoever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K00600","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359633300,"counter":487,"content":"<p>None whatsoever.

I listened to other members when they were asking questions and I would like them to listen to me asking mine.  In December we visited Maghaberry Prison.  Some of my colleagues in my party were aghast and asked me why I was doing that but because I had faith in the former Cabinet Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, he invited me to accompany him and I did so.  I was shocked and horrified by what I heard from the different groups we met.  One of the groups we met had just come off the dirty protest and they said that some of the prison officers were using sexual connotations.  I will not repeat what they told us but it was to the effect that now that they were off the dirty protest they will be into this.<\/p><p>  We also visited Marian Price.  It is beyond me why she is being held in that prison.  She is physically unable to move.  As Ms McCabe is aware, her sister Dolours died a few days ago.  Marian told us that when she was being sent to the hospital for X-rays she was double handcuffed.  Having met the woman I know she is not able to run away but the way she is being kept there is cruel.  This is the issue Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is concerned about, namely, people being held there because they had a record in the past.  If the Government in the North has an issue with them, it should be brought to due legal process.<\/p><p>  When I returned I advised my colleagues who had told me I should not go to visit the prison.  On 17 December my observations were vindicated by Chief Inspector Brendan McGuigan, who issued his report on Maghaberry Prison, and everything we had heard on our visit two weeks earlier was in his report.  It referred to violent bullying, intimidation, overcrowding and significant weaknesses in the system.  He criticised the system in Maghaberry Prison.<\/p><p>  In as brief a reply as possible I would like to know what Ms McCabe intends to do about that.  When I visited the prison I was stand-offish about the people I would meet because I am totally supportive of the peace process, but I was shocked by what the prisoners told us, and it was vindicated within a week in Mr. Brendan McGuigan's report.  I will not labour the point.  We have to get to the bottom of this to keep the peace process in place.  That is the reason I and my colleagues visited the prison.  As briefly as she can do so I ask Ms McCabe to outline what she intends to do about Mr. Brendan McGuigan's report on Maghaberry Prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K01400","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1359633300,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCabe for attending.

I have explained this.  I have felt very frustrated, as have others, at the time it has taken to get the prison reform programme off the ground.  I have explained that some very important developments are now happening, but if they are to deliver the change required, other very important developments must happen with urgency and taken forward in a joined-up way.  The current efforts are very much targeted at doing that.  Anne Owens made the point that there is no point in cherry-picking.  She said what we need is root and branch reform and a joined-up approach to all of this process.<\/p><p>  In terms of the specifics the Senator raised when she spoke to the prisoners, I come back to the fact that by far my biggest client group would be the republican prisoners.  What I do each and every time, and sometimes I get multiple complaints about the same topic but sometimes I get individual ones, is carry out an investigation and, on the basis of facts and evidence, make the most helpful and constructive recommendations possible.  It is very important for me to investigate properly and gather the evidence regarding what the prison service is saying and what the republican prisoners are saying.  We deal in evidence and I find that, generally, in terms of moving forward, that is the most constructive approach to adopt.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt that when somebody comes into prison, comments are made, and in many instances we find there is substance to those comments, but I cannot comment in general because what I do when I get a complaint is carry out the kind of investigation I have described.  When I find things I believe are wrong, in breach of prison rules or in breach of human rights, I do not hesitate to go straight to the people who need to do something about addressing them.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Marian Price, I have said that I do not have a complaint and anyway I could not talk about an individual case.  I would respectfully point out, however, that we have to make a distinction in terms of those who believe there is a question around whether she should be in prison.  My interest as prison ombudsman is the way we are looking after and responding to the needs of whoever is in the prison.  That is the part of the equation with which I am concerned.  I believe the other questions are for others.<\/p> <p> Let me outline the two steps that I believe are most important in making a difference.  First, the strands of work that have not been done quickly enough to ensure adequate purposeful activity in prison for everybody need to be fast-tracked urgently.  Everything I have seen in the past five years persuades me that locking up prisoners, be they ill, addicted, lonely, angry or frustrated, for long periods does nothing to achieve rehabilitation.  It does nothing to protect vulnerable prisoners.  For those with an interest in drugs, it does nothing but encourage them to go looking for them.  It stops them from sleeping at night, which increasingly incentivises them to try to obtain medicine and drugs.  I met the change team yesterday and note it is trying very hard to address these issues.  The reports that we and others produce indicate progress is much too slow, but it would be unfair if I did not say that fairly strenuous efforts are now being made to take action on the back of the reports.<\/p><p> The second step concerns management capacity and capability.  We do have some good governors but the prison service has not addressed adequately the need to build a critical mass of managers and supervisors who are truly pulling in the direction in which we are trying to travel.  There are a great many people in the Northern Ireland Prison Service who have known no other world.  In any change programme, it is vital that there be staff with different ideas and experiences who can come into the mix and have an influence.  To date, the change programme has not provided for that adequately.  As I have said to all the parties, the Minister, the prison service and the trust, dealing with this issue should be accorded very high priority.  Steps are now being taken to achieve this but it is a quite difficult process.  There is much red tape and bureaucracy associated with what one is allowed to do in Northern Ireland.  This sometimes undermines very important steps that should be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013013100009#K01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359633900,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The report contains an oblique reference to unequal outcomes, depending on one's religion.

Having a representative workforce is the best way of ensuring everybody feels he is treated fairly and equally.  Clearly, this is not the starting point in the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The service recognises fully the need to monitor very carefully what is happening in that respect.  That we have identified that the figures being produced were flawed means, I hope, that the information gathered henceforth will be more accurate.

While I believe there must be consequences when people bully, one of the most likely outcomes in such circumstances is that the minute the person in question comes out of cellular confinement, he or she will be twice as motivated to go and bully the person who he or she initially was motivating and who now has resulted in him or her having a period of cellular confinement.

I refer to a situation in which it is a way of life that people are locked up for long periods and not something that is just used as a punishment.  The Deputy may have read my report on Allyn Baxter, which I published last year.

How important is balanced cross-community representation in the recruitment of prison officers, if they are being recruited at present?  Second, having read the United Kingdom commission's proposal on a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom, I noted there were many references to prisoners' rights.  One of the outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement is a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

I believe it is established good practice everywhere that it is in our interests to have a workforce that is representative of the people for whom they are responsible for whom they care and to whom they deliver a service.  We are in the middle of a major recruitment process in Northern Ireland to recruit new officers.  A severance programme is operational and officers are leaving the service, while other officers are being recruited and already have started to move out into prisons and to become part of the prison workforce.  The director general made a public statement not very long ago in which she expressed disappointment that the balance achieved, with regard to the people being appointed, is not what the service would have wished.  As for the predominance of appointments, there have been more male and more Protestant appointments than there have been Catholic or those designated as \"other\".  Obviously, when the Patten programme was rolled out, 50:50 recruitment was in place, which basically made sure that those who were recruited into the service, certainly with regard to the Catholic-Protestant ratio, were recruited in an equal measure.  However, within the prison service, the issues of gender, foreign nationals, disability and all those other areas of representation are absolutely as important.

On the positive side, I note that I have invested significant effort in running sessions for all the new officers coming in.  I go to the college and run sessions for all of them and take the opportunity to engage with them and talk about the way forward.  I must state the quality of people actually being recruited and the experience and attitudes they bring have been hugely encouraging.  We just need to make efforts in the future to encourage applicants who are more representative.  In fairness, with the wisdom of hindsight, perhaps not enough effort was put into encouraging applicants from right across the community.  In policing, I was on the board when civilian recruitment was being considered and even though we did not have a 50:50 ratio, we did a colossal amount of work to encourage under-represented groups to apply.
