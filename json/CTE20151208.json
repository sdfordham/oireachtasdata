In terms of quotas, all fishing opportunities are set down for member states in the total allowable catch and quota regulation each year.  Quotas are not allocated in respect of member states' exclusive fisheries zones, but are instead set out in relation to one or more International Commission for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, areas.  ICES areas cut across exclusive fisheries zone boundaries.  The quota allocations associated with each ICES area or areas of operation must be strictly adhered to by individual member states.  Furthermore, the collection and transmission of catch and landings data is mandatory.  However, the EU does not require vessels to inform the coastal member state of the quota made available to them when entering the exclusive fisheries zone to fish.<\/p> <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, has advised me that the following arrangements apply.  On entering Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone, the vessel's vessel monitoring system will provide the national fisheries monitoring centre at the naval base in Haulbowline with its position, which is in turn relayed to all naval vessels at sea and to all SFPA port offices.  The plots of the vessel's position are recorded every 15 minutes, with the operational display refreshed every two hours, while the vessel is operational in Irish waters.  The 15-minute positions are held within the vessel's system on board and can be called down if a catch area review is required, for which two-hourly records would not be sufficient.  When the vessel commences fishing, its electronic reporting system will open the vessel's fishing logbook to be viewed by the fisheries monitoring centre and, in turn, all SFPA operational staff, and will relay by way of submission of records by the vessel master the detail of the fishing gear in use, the duration of each fishing operation, the location by longitude and latitude of the fishing operation, and the species, catches and discards, should they occur, in kilogrammes while the vessel is active in Irish waters.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the overall framework for fisheries controls in the EU, in October 2009, a new regulation dealing with fisheries' controls was adopted.  Council regulation No. 1224 of 2009 establishes a community controlled system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Control and inspection are now focused where they are most effective, through an approach based on systematic risk analysis.  Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The control regulations were introduced in order that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.<\/p> <p>  The committee also requested that I address the possibility that large freezer fishing vessels carry on board independent fisheries monitoring personnel for periods of operation in Ireland&rsquo;s exclusive fisheries zone.  The SFPA and the Naval Service, through the fisheries monitoring centre, has monitored the movements of these vessels when in our exclusive fisheries zone using the vessel monitoring system, automatic identification system, and declared catches through the electronic reporting system or the electronic logbook, as it is known.  I am advised that there are four freezer vessels currently in our exclusive fisheries zone and that no inspections have been conducted in recent days due to adverse weather conditions.  These are ships.  To board one of these vessels, the weather must allow one to do it safely.  These vessels operate quite a long way out to sea most of the time and if one drops a rigid inflatable boat from a naval vessel, heavy swell would make it very difficult to go alongside this vessel to get on board.  The Naval Service is very conscious of the concern and is anxious to make boardings and assessments.<\/p> <p>  This risk assessment had informed the SFPA&rsquo;s identification of some of these vessels as a high priority for at-sea inspection and aircraft surveillance.  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland.  The weather has been particularly severe in the recent past.  Boarding vessels of this size at sea creates specific challenges and to date the operational decision of the Naval Service has been that weather has been too severe to attempt a boarding operation safely.  I am advised that the Naval Service has ships on patrol and is ready to conduct boarding operations on these vessels when weather conditions permit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the control measures available to the control authorities, within the north-west waters member states group we are examining additional control measures to support the landing obligation.  The ban on discarding pelagic stocks, such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on 1 January 2015.  A control experts group from the north-west waters member states group has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries.  The views of the Pelagic Advisory Council on the recommendations have been received and will be fully considered.  The draft recommendations of the control experts and the Pelagic Advisory Council's views are being considered by the north-west waters member states group.  That is a group of countries that are fishing in similar areas and have similar interests which collectively try to make strategic policy and implementation decisions.<\/p> <p>  The measures recommended by the control experts cover a range of actions, including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment, on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own refrigerated seawater tank vessels, to support the landing obligation.  It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically-assessed risks of a more transient nature&rdquo;.  It is important to note that the flag member state would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels.  Any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag member state and the coastal member state to monitor and control fishing activities better.  I would not be satisfied with the idea that a Dutch-owned vessel would have a Dutch observer while in Irish waters.  We need to reassure people, and the way to do that is to have Irish controls in place in the waters for which we have responsibility.  We will continue to work closely with the north-west waters member states group to identify the control actions that are most useful in order that the landing obligation is fully respected.<\/p><p>Finally, it is important to point out that the control of fishing vessels within Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone is a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating in the area.  As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved with the operational matters, including those relating to law enforcement.  That is for a good reason in terms of experience.  I hope that is a helpful statement but I can answer questions if people have them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#B01000","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  Deputies Harrington, Pringle and I are from coastal areas and we have been contacted by very concerned people about the action, particularly off the coast of Donegal, and the factory freezer ships like the <i>Margiris<\/i>operating there.  The big problem is we are told that the only way to police them properly is by having a control observer on the vessel.  From the Minister's presentation, it appears that the control experts advisory council has indicated that a flag member state will be responsible for placing control observers on the vessel.  It is essential that if vessels are operating in Irish waters, and given the concern that exists, observers must include somebody from the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, or a similar body, which would have responsibility for the jurisdiction and protection of fish there.  A programme was shown in Holland about people on board one of those vessels, which have graders and machinery to munch discards before letting them out underneath the boat.  If that is happening, I am reliably told that going on what the programme shows, there are up to 70% discards, which will do terrible damage to fish stocks if it is true.<\/p><p>Is it the Minister's assessment from the advisory council that a control observer will be from the SFPA when vessels fish in Irish waters?  Will the Minister say, definitively or reasonably accurately, that the percentage of quota allocated to those vessels is what is reported when they are in Irish waters?

There are a number of issues.  There has been much concern over the past four to six weeks about the operation of these vessels off the west coast.  As the Minister has said, there are four vessels there today and at various stages there have been four or five operating continually over the past number of weeks.  The Minister mentioned control measures etc. that have been discussed at the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council.  Would it be possible for the SFPA or the Naval Service to ask these vessels to come closer to shore to allow an inspection where it is safe to do so?  Is that not something that would be within the control suite of measures that the Naval Service or SFPA could use?  The <i>Margiris<\/i>is today only a couple of hours out of Killybegs and Bruckless Bay.  If she could be instructed to come in and be inspected, at least it would be something.<\/p><p>The Naval Service and the SFPA have continually indicated over the past number of weeks that the weather has been too bad to allow any boardings.  Is the Naval Service sitting off these vessels or watching what they are doing?  The <i>Margiris<\/i>, according to the SFPA, has only a quota for horse mackerel in Irish waters and has no quota for anything else.  Therefore, if the <i>Margiris<\/i>is not catching clean horse mackerel, it must be breaching the discard ban in place since 1 January.  What visual inspections are taking place and what monitoring is ongoing?  Are we relying on their electronic log book as a way of trying to police the operations of this vessel?  The quota is for horse mackerel only and there must be something else happening.  My information from fishermen is that it is difficult to get clean horse mackerel off the west coast of Ireland at this time of year, particularly with the bad weather we have had as well.  The weather disperses the horse mackerel, even if it was clean, and breaks them up.  What was the Department, the Naval Service or the SFPA doing over the past four or five weeks on this?<\/p><p>The Minister indicated in his contribution that inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  As I understand it, there is a requirement when fish are sold at the home port etc. that this must be reported as well through the EU process.  In one example, Spanish vessels have sustainable fishing certification for hake within Irish waters but it is noted in that certification that there are no returns of sale figures when the fish are landed in Spanish ports.  Do we have the same problem when the <i>Margiris<\/i>lands in Holland?  What figures are received for what is caught in exclusive Irish zones, for example?  How are people sure about what is happening?<\/p><p>A couple of weeks ago the <i>Margiris<\/i>and other vessels towed away large numbers of crab pots belonging to fishermen in Donegal.

These are major questions on how this is policed and we can do that as a member state.  This is taken in conjunction with how rigorously our own vessels are policed and monitored; to allow these vessels to operate with virtual impunity in our waters is very difficult for our fishing communities to accept or understand.<\/p><p>I have asked about observers in parliamentary questions as well and the answer has always been that if observers are placed on board, it is important to remember that they would be from the flag member state.

The truth is this has caused considerable comment and not just in coastal communities, as it happens.<\/p><p>It has become almost a national debate, in particular on social media and in some of the industry publications as well.  The four vessels are the <i>Margiris<\/i>, the<i>Annelies Ilena<\/i>, the<i>Jan Maria<\/i>and the <i>Willem Van Der Zwan<\/i>, which are Lithuanian, Dutch and German ships.  If we take what they say, and what the press releases of their association say, that they are operating in good faith, is there any reason that we cannot ask them that before they enter Irish-controlled waters they would come to port for a brief few hours for an inspection before they reach the fishing grounds and, similarly as they leave and if a boarding cannot be carried out by authorised officials, that the ships would be inspected at a port before they leave?  They are not just fishing vessels; they are processors and that is the way they should be dealt with.  There are cameras, inspections and at times much self-reporting in processing factories onshore.  The regime is a little different.  In this case, there are four processing vessels with huge capability not just to catch fish, but to process them.  We take it at face value that they are catching within their quotas.  The rules should apply in Irish territorial waters equally to processors onshore.  A pre-fishing inspection and a post-fishing inspection in Irish-controlled waters should be acceptable if they are genuine and acting in good faith.  I do not see how the vessel managers would not facilitate such a request if they were requested to comply.  If not, I agree with the Minister that if officials were to hold onboard inspections then the inspectors should be Irish-based officials.  I cannot say a Lithuanian, Dutch or German official would do anything differently but the perception would be all wrong and it would be difficult to manage.<br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that a significant amount of foreign or visiting vessels come into Irish waters not just in the pelagic sector, but also in the white fish sector.  Equally, we have Irish vessels fishing in other waters.  For example, a cod quota is caught by an Irish vessel in Norwegian waters and cuttlefish are caught by Irish vessels in UK waters, but the scale of it is completely different.  There is a significant issue of perception and a greater effort in terms of being more proactive on enforcement would allay many fears.  As Deputy Pringle and Deputy Ferris said, if the vessels are working outside the law, that would be picked up very quickly if such an inspection regime were in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#C01200","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I share many of the concerns expressed but it is inaccurate to give the impression that those vessels are operating with impunity.  This year, the 58 year old skipper of the <i>Annelies Ilena<\/i>, formerly the <i>Atlantic Dawn<\/i>, an Irish boat &ndash; let us take a look at ourselves in the mirror also &ndash; was fined more than &euro;100,000 in Donegal Circuit Court after being found guilty by a jury on three charges of illegal fishing in Irish waters.  When we can, we do inspect and if there are problems we bring the boats into port.  Deputy Pringle will remember the vessel being in Donegal.  I do not mean when it was the <i>Atlantic Dawn<\/i>.  That was not meant to be a jibe.<\/p><p>I have spoken to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service and I know there is a desire to board and inspect the vessels.  Part of the problem is that in the middle of winter, in particular given the weather in the past three weeks, there are safety considerations.  My understanding is that there are legal difficulties in requiring a vessel to come into port without having some cause for requiring it to do so.  It is expensive for a vessel of that size to spend a number of hours going into port, tying up, having an inspection and heading back out to sea.  There needs to be a reason to bring vessels of that size into port.<\/p><p>The information Deputy Pringle has from the SFPA may have been correct at the time it was given but the information I have today is that the database shows that Lithuania has a quota of 644 tonnes of mackerel in ICES zones 6, 7 and 6B, of which 544 tonnes have been caught, and the <i>Margiris<\/i>has a Lithuanian flag.  Lithuania also has a quota of 5,953 tonnes of horse mackerel, of which 4,000 tonnes have been caught.  Lithuania has a quota for a by-catch of mackerel but whether it has got it through some kind of swap arrangement, which may be the case, it would mean that the information the Deputy got is technically correct but that the quota has been swapped to get mackerel in order to be compliant when fishing in Irish waters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#D00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That swap might have only taken place after the vessels started fishing here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#D00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I do not know.

I can only take legal action if someone is breaking the rules and breaking the law.  It is a very difficult situation.  We are going on the logbook information that we can get on the vessels.  I would like to be able to back that up by inspections and seeing what is happening on the vessels.  I have made my view known but I do not want to force boardings of vessels in totally inappropriate or dangerous weather conditions.  I wish to reassure people broadly, as I have had many communications on the issue, that we do board vessels and inspect them and if we find that people are breaking the rules we bring them in and prosecute them.  There is a good example of that this year already.<\/p> <p>  To give members an idea in terms of the Netherlands, which owns most of the large vessels, it has a boarfish quota of 200 tonnes, a north-west herring quota of just over 1,600 tonnes, a Celtic Sea herring quota of 1,600 tonnes, a horse mackerel quota of 36,000 tonnes, a mackerel quota of 35,000 tonnes and a blue whiting quota of 55,000 tonnes.  As most people who understand the fishing industry know, the pelagic sector in Europe is dominated by Dutch-flagged vessels.  They are big players in this sector and we sometimes see their boats here, but they have a quota they are entitled to catch.  They just happen to catch it in much bigger vessels than most other countries, and that is what is causing concern.  Some of our vessels also have the ability to catch huge volumes of fish, very similar to what those vessels catch in a day, but they do not have the capacity to process them on board as well.  The vessels are not as large physically but the fishing capacity in terms of net size is very similar.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, this comes down to enforcement and reassuring people that not only are we getting information from electronic logbooks, but also that we are putting people on vessels and physically inspecting them, and that we are part of a decision around whether we put cameras on the vessels.  There are very mixed views within the fishing industry as to whether there should be cameras on vessels.  We are trying to come up with a balance that can reassure the broader public on the new rules of the Common Fisheries Policy in terms of the grading and discarding of fish and releasing large numbers of juvenile fish if the catch has an average size that is too small.  That type of activity in the pelagic sector could involve very large volumes and we need to stop it.

I will follow it up in discussion with other Ministers.  We have received correspondence from the Dutch pelagic industry on this and that industry has also sent some letters to newspapers to give its side of the story.  I realise there is concern about it so we will continue to discuss it.<\/p><p>With regard to the sustainable impact assessment of EU Commission proposals for this year, the annual fishing opportunities for fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Fisheries Council.  This year, the arrangements for 2016 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 14 and 15 December, which is next week.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and the quotas for Ireland will again be determined at that meeting following negotiations with member states and the EU Commission.<\/p><p>Before I discuss the substance of the impact assessment of the proposals, I will outline some pertinent facts about the Irish fishing industry.  Sometimes there is a certain misrepresentation of the state of the industry and a desire always to focus on negative issues.  Some positive facts about the Irish seafood industry are worth noting.  The industry is worth approximately &euro;850 million annually and employs 11,000 people.  There are approximately 2,100 registered commercial sea fishing vessels in Ireland and there are 164 seafood processing companies here.  Ireland exports seafood to 80 markets worldwide.  The top five markets are France, UK, Spain, Nigeria, from which I have just returned, and Italy.  The value of Irish seafood exports rose by 70% from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;540 million in 2014.  People who say this industry is dying on its feet should look at those figures.<\/p><p>Irish landings have substantially increased from 85,700 tonnes in 1973 to 314,000 tonnes in 2014 since Ireland joined the EU in 1973.  The Atlantic waters where Irish vessels operate, stretching from the north of Scotland to Brittany and into the English Channel contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  Ireland's total share in 2015 amounted to 227,693 tonnes, with a total value of &euro;205 million.  Ireland's share of these fishing opportunities for 2015 represented 20% by tonnage and 19.5% by value.  There are also very valuable inshore species which are not subjected to EU total allowable catch, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and are fished by the Irish fleet inside the six-mile coastal zone.<\/p><p>On the issue of quota in general, I am often called upon to get a bigger share of the quotas for Ireland or simply to ignore the quota regime altogether and allow a free for all for Irish vessels.  I would love to get a bigger slice of the pie for Ireland but to do so it must come from another member state.  The current quota regime was set down in 1983 based on track record in the 1970s and the only way to change this policy is to get agreement from member states and the European Parliament.  I must be realistic.  My counterparts in the UK and France are not simply going to hand over quota to Ireland.<b><\/b>Consequently, my focus is on making the best possible use of the resource that we have and to build up that resource.<\/p><p>The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way with the publication of proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland in mid-November last.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations -<b><\/b>such as blue whiting and whiting in the Celtic Sea - are not included in the proposal yet.  Earlier negotiations on the total allowable catch for mackerel<b><\/b>for 2016 resulted in a substantial quota for Irish fishermen for next year of over 75,000 tonnes.  This quota is worth over &euro;63 million directly to our catching sector and the new long-term management strategy that was also agreed will provide stability to our fishermen in this vital fishery for Ireland by avoiding large variations in the quota from year to year.<\/p><p>A very important element this year concerns a number of demersal stocks that will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016<b><\/b>for the first time.  The landing obligation or discards ban, as it is known, was a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and was agreed by all member states as well as the European Parliament.  For Ireland, the stocks affected in the first year from the point of view of whitefish, as it is already in force for demersal stocks, will be nephrops in area VII, whiting in the Celtic Sea and haddock in the Irish Sea and west of Scotland.<\/p><p>The point of the landing obligation is gradually to phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and to end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  It will not be easy but it is vital if we are to protect the sustainability of our coastal communities that depend on healthy fish stocks.  To give an example, we currently discard over 25%<b><\/b>of our whiting catches in the Celtic Sea.  We discard or dump 37% of our haddock catches in the Irish Sea.  There are similar and worse rates in most of our fisheries.  This is simply unsustainable and a dreadful waste of a valuable resource.  Operators should use improved fishing gear that does not catch juveniles so that all mature fish can be landed for the benefit of our coastal communities.  The bottom line is that we must constantly seek to manage what we have in a more sustainable way.  We must only catch those fish that we want to catch and we must avoid juveniles.  We must challenge the <i>status quo<\/i>and strive to make our fleets more efficient in what they do in order to maximise the economic return and protect the sustainability of our stocks.  That is essentially what the new Common Fisheries Policy is about.  It will benefit everybody in time, including fishermen.<\/p><p>One measure to lessen the immediate impact of the discards ban which was included in the CFP, at my insistence, is that the Commission is obliged to take account of previously discarded fish when considering its TAC proposals.  So called &quot;quota uplift&quot; must be applied to the TAC for each of the affected stocks.  This is a complex process and has not yet been finalised.  However, I am optimistic that there will be a degree of uplift for the relevant stocks in the final outcome next week.  I will aim to ensure that Irish fishermen get the maximum uplift compatible with stock sustainability.  In my experience fishermen understand fully the importance of protecting our natural resources and are open to new ways of doing things.  They also understand, more than anybody, the importance of good science.  Our industry works closely with the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in the industry science partnership to ensure that knowledge is fully shared.<\/p><p>The Commission's proposals for TACs and quotas for 2016 are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES,<b><\/b>the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  To inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  The preparation of this impact assessment is provided for in the programme for Government.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation<b><\/b>process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2016.  From 11 November, an online web portal on www.fishingnet.ie was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.<\/p><p>In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 24 November which gave a further opportunity to interested parties to outline their positions directly to me on the many aspects of this proposal.  In all, four submissions were received by the closure date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline is to be found on the website.<\/p><p>I agree with the sentiment in many of the contributions which call for greater adherence to the available scientific advice to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken allied with a concern that if we introduce total allowable catch, TAC, and maximum sustainable yield, MSY, level in a big bang, it would be an unacceptable scenario in terms of economic and social impacts.  Let me be clear, I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied they are necessary.  If the scientific advice is clear that cuts are necessary, I will support them, but I will not support cuts which would simply create a real risk of generating higher discard levels than at present, or where there is a risk that overly severe cuts could jeopardise seriously the social and economic sustainability of our fishing fleets.  I want and will fight for sustainable fish stocks, but hand in hand with this I will fight for a sustainable and vibrant fishing industry in terms of working through the changes we will introduce in the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.<\/p><p> I will go into more detail in a moment, but to illustrate what we are facing next week, I will outline some of the cuts for some other important stocks.  There proposed reductions are 9.6% in nephrops, and this includes the Commission's proposal for a quota uplift; 43% in cod and 27% in haddock in the Celtic Sea; 52% in haddock in the Irish Sea, and this includes the Commission's proposal for quota uplift, which seems extraordinary; and 12% in monkfish in the Celtic Sea.  I do not believe that reductions in quota on this scale are either justified or necessary.  There are stocks where I can accept the cuts proposed, for example, Celtic Sea herring, which is prudently managed by the Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee.  North-west herring is also of major concern to the Commission, which proposes a zero TAC.  This is another complex issue.  Given the fact there are two stocks and two management areas, the science cannot for one moment differentiate between the two.<\/p><p> The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, have undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute's view is that while noting an improvement in the status of some fish stocks, others remain a concern.  The impact assessment summarises the pressure on the 72 stocks dealt with in the 2015 stock book.  There are a higher number of sustainable fish stocks, at 26, and percentage, at 36%, in 2015 compared with last year.  The percentage and number of stocks overfished has declined in 2015, although the number and percentage of stocks with unknown status is similar to last year.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document laid before the D&aacute;il and in the accompanying stock book prepared by the Marine Institute.  I am willing to address any specific issues on the individual stocks raised.<\/p><p> The current set of proposals will see a net reduction in fishing opportunity of 13.8% by volume.  This amounts to a direct income reduction of more than &euro;11.5 million.  These figures can be further explained.  There is a proposed net reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal sector, which is white fish and prawns, of 12% by volume, with a direct income reduction of &euro;10.4 million.  Of this, the prawn fleet will see a critical reduction of 9% by volume.  This includes the Commission's proposal for uplift and a direct income reduction of &euro;5.5 million.<\/p><p> For the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and west coast, there will be an 18% reduction in fishing opportunities.  This is &euro;12.4 million for the demersal fleet.  This will directly impact on the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere and Rossaveel as well as other smaller ports.  The picture is somewhat better for the north-west stocks, in that there is a 14% increase in fishing opportunities, which is &euro;900,000 in value, for the demersal fleets.  This will directly impact on the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  We still have zero proposals for herring and we need a small fishery for this stock.<\/p><p> In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income will also be lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries such as net making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  Based on turnover multipliers from fish landed in distinct Irish ports, BIM estimates the full costs of the proposed quota reduction are in the order of &euro;23.5 million.  BIM further estimates on the basis of the most recent employment survey that these reductions could impact on between 275 and 325 full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.<\/p><p> The proposals do not include the Hague preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where total allowable catches are in decline.  These are additional amounts of quota which Ireland and the UK claim for important white fish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quota comes off their allocations.  Ensuring the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2016 would amount to more than 1,300 tonnes of fish, with a direct value of &euro;2.6 million according to BIM.  The full value of the Hague quotas in 2016 is &euro;5.2 million, with an associated impact on between 60 and 70 full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.<\/p><p> Apart from the stock specifics, there are also other issues of a cross-cutting nature I would like to comment on briefly.  Regarding maximum sustainable yield, I am committed to the ambitious policy of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  This must be implemented in a rational and progressive manner.  In line with the CFP, I consider that we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.  Cod and haddock in the Celtic Sea are examples of fisheries where there is, I believe, a strong socioeconomic justification to delay the delivery of MSY in the short term, but in any case ensure its delivery by 2020 at the latest.<\/p><p> I concur with the findings of the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  I will not support cuts based on an overly narrow or rigid interpretation of the scientific advice.  I will seek to make full use of the flexibility allowed under the Common Fisheries Policy, where justified.  I will support cuts where the scientific advice is clear that the reduction in fishery mortality is necessary for the long-term sustainability of the stocks in question.  There is a high cost from a social and economic perspective when quota cuts are imposed, and I must be satisfied in every case that these cuts are justifiable.  Fishing ports and entire communities around our coast are dependent on fisheries for their very survival.<\/p><p> I publicly thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment, and I look forward to the debate and any questions people may have.  I reassure the fishing industry and NGOs that we will approach next week in the way we have done in recent years, using science as the basis of our arguments.  I must have the interests of stocks in mind but also people's livelihoods to ensure we can keep them in business through a very demanding transition period, which is what we are in at present in terms of implementing a new Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#F00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

Reference was made to the improvement in the catches since 1973.

In his opening comments he said he is constantly being told that he should get more quota for Irish fishermen.  We do not seem to have a high-level vision at European level of Ireland&rsquo;s position in terms of fishing.  In the past five to six years we were constantly told how much Germany is the paymaster of Europe and we have to toe the line and do everything we are told by Germany.  Everyone does bend the knee to Germany and we have seen the outcome of that for every other country.  Since we joined the EU we have contributed fishing stocks to every other member state.  The EU changed the rules as we were negotiating membership to make protection of fishing stocks the sole competency of the Commission, which was its only sole competency at the time.  That was because they knew what we were bringing to the table and we did not because our industry was underdeveloped.  We should make a high-level case at every opportunity in Europe and we should have a vision.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s vision is of a united Ireland and that is what the party works towards and will try to achieve at some point.  We do not seem to have a vision for the fishing industry.  Our vision seems to be to make the best of an ever-decreasing cake every year.  We just manage to get as much out of the declining stocks as we can every year.<\/p> <p>  The quota uplifts are already included in the proposed cuts by the Commission.  What is on the table from the Commission already includes quota uplifts.  Is that a correct interpretation?  If it is, the CFP changes were sold on the basis that while it would be difficult especially in the demersal fleet for fishermen to meet the discard ban, there would be a quota uplift that would recognise the difficulties and see how that might be achieved.  What would the total allowable catch, TAC, proposals be if they did not include the quota uplift?  How much of a quota uplift is included in the TACs that are proposed?<\/p> <p>  What role does the social impact assessment play in the negotiations and does it carry any weight?  Is it just a negotiating tool for the Minister?  I would like to see more done in future years in terms of the social impact assessment rather than just looking at the value and loss in value of landings.  There are bigger social impacts evident around the coast in terms of the impact on communities, for example, in increased emigration and loss of human capital.  I would like to see the assessment expanded in future because we were told the Commission is supposed to be looking more closely at social impacts.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to north west herring and the need to have some form of TAC, in particular for small-scale fisheries.  That is vitally important, especially for boats of less than 15 m and less than 10 m.  They should have some amount of TAC because it is one of the few types of fishing that is sustainable for them if they could get access to quota.  It is vitally important that some TAC would be negotiated in respect of north west herring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#H01300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Harrington as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was not present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#H01400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I was not here earlier as I was busy.

It does paint a very bleak picture, in particular for area VII in the south.  It is important to get an idea of what that means for coastal communities as well as they look on the negotiations with some fear.  There is much riding on how the negotiations will progress.  From that point of view we wish the Minister the very best of luck in dealing with the proposed cuts by the Commission.<\/p> <p>  Those communities continue to invest quite a lot.  There is increased investment in enforcement as there is a new system of penalty points.  There is a greater enforcement effort in particular onshore in the factories.  The authorities are essentially following the money in the fishing industry.  There is greater compliance offshore due to the fear that exists.  We were hoping that we would see some return on that, in particular in terms of a quota uplift and reporting of discards, which is still legal in most species, in particular on the demersal side.<\/p><p>It seems disappointing.  It would be interesting to see the figures on a quota uplift based on what the Marine Institute and the FSAI believe are the actual amount of discards based on what fishermen do.  I would be very interested in comments on that.  Part of the reporting structure in the stock book shows improvements in some fisheries while some remain a concern.  We do not know what stocks have deteriorated and how that ties in with the Commission's proposals.  That has an impact on trying to achieve the maximum sustainable yield, MSY, by 2020.  The fishing community will have to make big investments.  It needs to see a better effort by the industry, the discards implementation committee or the Department at informing fishermen about what is actually going on and how they are to achieve these MSYs and greater sustainability beyond 2020 while putting up with cuts proposed by the Commission.<\/p><p> The reality is that in some fisheries - and it is sometimes seen on the pelagic side where there have been cuts and reduced quotas and landings -  it has had a positive impact on prices.  However, that does not happen with white fish, it simply does not work.  A proposed cut in the white fish sector, unlike prawns for example, does not have an impact on price.  We are price followers in many ways and white fish is expensive at market.  It does not increase but this measure does have a real effect on take-home pay for the fishing community.  It is a different dynamic between the two fisheries.<\/p><p> With regard to the social impact it is clear that either we do not have enough quota or we have an over-capacity in the white fish fleet.  It is becoming unsustainable for many operators who would have made a living in the recent past.  They are finding it increasingly difficult despite the inputs into the industry and with fuel costs being low.  We still see family businesses under immense pressure.  It is most disappointing that the enforcement regime, the compliance regime, the introduction of discards, the banning of the landing obligation and the MSY issue - which needs to be dealt with over the next four or five years - are all meant to give a return to the communities yet it seems to be going the other way.  This should be the central plank of the argument regarding the social impacts of these cuts for coastal communities, especially in the south and south-west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#H01600","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  It is getting late in the day, we still have an awful lot to discuss at this committee this evening and I must also attend the D&aacute;il.  I accept the Minister's comments up to a point and that the current inequitable fishing arrangement was arrived at in the 1980s.  It was wrong then and it is wrong now.  We do not receive a disproportionate amount of German mine or British mine yields or any other wealth.  Fishing was the one resource for which everyone made a power grab.  I did not agree with the decision when it was made and I still do not agree with it.  One might say, as the Minister has, that nothing can be done about this.  Normally I would accept that but I believe the Government, up until March 2016 and whoever comes after, has a unique opportunity to do something about this situation.  Our neighbours in the UK are rewriting the rulebook.  It is important for this State to say: \"Well if it is good enough for the UK to rewrite the rulebook then Ireland cannot agree to any rewriting of the rulebook unless a few rules are changed for us also.\"  God loves a trier and the crying baby gets the bottle.  If one does not cry one does not get the bottle.  The Government should put down a stake in this wide negotiation into which the UK Government is entering.  Let us be honest about it, other countries perennially put down stakes at EU meetings over matters they consider of national importance - over things that happened more than 100 years ago.<\/p> <p>  It is a travesty that Ireland has only 4% of the EU fish, even though 14% of the fish is in our waters and is worth &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion per year.  It is equivalent to all the funding being paid annually by the EU.  Can the Minister indicate if the Government will, if re-elected, make a case in Europe that the totally unjust 1980s arrangement should be put to rights?  We have a unique opportunity because there is no doubt we will be asked to support some package for the UK and I do not believe we should give them a free lunch.  The interests of our people must be negotiated as well.  We are not looking for anything that is not ours, we are just looking for our own property back.<\/p> <p>  One of the big failings of the Common Fisheries Policy was the failure to get the Hague preferences made permanent.  A great play is made every year to save the Hague preferences and each and every year they are \"saved\".  Some year a Minister will fail to save them and that is worth 70 or 80 jobs, as the Minister has said himself.  Will the Minister say how confident he is that the Hague preferences will be saved?<\/p> <p>  This committee and the sub-committee have done a lot of work on the inshore fisheries sector regarding coastal communities and islands.  One of the very sensible proposals was to seek to reserve a greater area of sea for boats measuring under10 m.  In the context of population it seemed that this would suit a lot more fishermen because 80% of the boats in Ireland are under 10 m.  Electorally there are more people involved with small boats than bigger boats.  Has any effort been made to sell the idea as a conservation measure of the fish and of the communities?  In its treaties the EU is always talking about protecting rural, isolated and depopulated communities.  Has the Minister put the proposal forward officially in Brussels that Ireland would get a significant extension of sea area which would be retained solely for boats under a certain size? This is a way to help our inshore fishermen.  Obviously that would be beneficial for France or Spain but because we are an island - and as far as I am concerned we live in one country that goes the whole way around the island - because of our coast Ireland probably has more shoreline than any other country in Europe.  I would be interested to have an update on the case made by the Minister to his colleagues in Europe and how much tick tacking he has done with colleagues across Europe.  Our British colleagues would be very interested and Scotland would be incredibly interested in this proposal.  Minister Michelle O'Neill in Northern Ireland would also be interested in the whole island approach.  Will the Minister indicate what he has actually done at European level to progress the idea, put forward by this committee, to increase the inshore area reserved for smaller boats?  If one lobbies them right, many French fishermen would be in favour of the proposal.  I am sure small, inshore fishermen in Spain and other countries feel the same challenges as our inshore fishermen from the large factory fishing boats.  I am very interested to find out what the Minister has done to promote the idea which was unanimously put forward by the sub-committee, set up by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#J00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>The inshore sector is not part of this debate, which relates to taxes and quotas.

We have done a great deal for the inshore sector in recent years.  For the first time, it has proper representation and is represented on quota allocation groups.  Also for the first time, it now has regional representative bodies in addition to its national representative body.  The Department will allocate approximately &euro;7 million to the sector from the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund under the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure it can run its operations properly and have a powerful say in future policy and quota decisions.  We have already made a decision, with input from the sector, to deal with recreational potting, which we will effectively prevent, except on a minor scale.  Tight restrictions will apply to what recreational potters can do when catching crabs or lobsters.  This is being done to protect the stock for the commercial sector.  We are doing a great deal on the inshore side, which is a sector that was ignored until a few years ago.  It now has a voice and is getting things done.<\/p> <p>  I do not disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that there should be a greater emphasis on providing opportunities for the inshore sector.  If we can negotiate that as part of European policy, that will be well and good, but I do not want to pretend we can do much in that area in the absence of a new Common Fisheries Policy, because that is where policy is decided.  I am focusing instead on achieving outcomes that can be delivered and providing the inshore sector with finance and an input into policy decisions, as has occurred for the first time.  We will examine the development of new product and branding opportunities around line-caught mackerel, for example, to create more and new opportunities.  In addition, as I have made clear to the industry, if we secure a north west herring quota, an allocation will be made to the small inshore vessels to ensure they benefit.  While a small quota for the bigger guys would mean a couple of additional days work each year and a top-up to their income from some of the other big operations they have in mackerel, a small quota would make a significant difference to inshore fishermen.  I have spent a great deal of time meeting and speaking to representatives of the inshore sector.  We will make the regional and national inshore fisheries forums, RIFF and NIFF, the new representative model for the sector.  This process is well under way.  <\/p> <p>  My preference was to have the Hague preferences enshrined in the new Common Fisheries Policy.  While this was not possible, we significantly improved the position that obtained before the new CFP was agreed.  The Hague preferences are mentioned in the preamble of the new policy, and while this is not guaranteed every year, we still need to negotiate and ensure we win that battle.  I would like the Hague preferences to be enshrined as a right, as opposed to being something that we have to negotiate.

Either Britain has recognised that the Common Fisheries Policy is good in terms of fish stocks or it has recognised that it cannot renegotiate the CFP.  Either way, it is not part of the package being renegotiated.<\/p> <p>  We are interested in trying to secure a bigger slice of the cake for Ireland and I will take any opportunity I can to achieve this objective.  However, I must try, year after year, to secure the best deal I can for fishermen in terms of providing practical assistance and income.  That is where the Department focuses its efforts. <\/p> <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy was agreed during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and under Ireland's chairmanship, and I am very attached to it.  To argue that there is no vision for fishing is completely untrue.  The new Common Fisheries Policy is a more visionary document for fishing than we have seen since Ireland joined the European Union.  We have committed to apply science in a much more rigorous manner.  We have committed to a model of sustainable fishing and maximum sustainable yield.  We have committed to regional decision making in a much more effective manner and we have committed to ending the disgraceful practice of discards, which is not the fault of fishermen but a by-product of flawed policy.  We are trying to ensure stocks in Irish waters, some of the most fertile fishing grounds on the planet, will grow and become more sustainable.  We will achieve this, with our European Union colleagues, through a Common Fisheries Policy.  I would love to be able to renegotiate the percentage allocation for Ireland under arrangements that have been in place for many years.  However, as that is not currently an option, we are acting in those areas in which we have options.<\/p> <p>  On maximum sustainable yield, a commitment has made to apply maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible, and to all stocks by the end of 2019.  When there are good socioeconomic reasons for not applying it immediately, we should not do so.  That is what was agreed in the Common Fisheries Policy.  There are plenty of people who would like to rewrite the document to suggest that we should insist on maximum sustainable yield for all stocks without delay.  That is a purist view from a conservation perspective and one that would devastate fishing communities if implemented.  The objective is to try to introduce this approach over time to give the fishing industry an opportunity to change and adapt while remaining in business.   Everyone will benefit when we reach our destination.  That is our objective and it will be the tone I adopt when I contribute to the debate next week.  I will seek to ensure that we apply the policy piece by piece, sector by sector and stock by stock, whether this applies to the introduction of the ban on discards, the obligation to land or maximum sustainable yield.  Clearly, there are very strong socioeconomic arguments to be made on some of the stocks.  <\/p> <p>  The information available to me indicates that the position as regards prawns would have been 10% worse if it were not for the quota uplift.  In other words, instead of a reduction of approximately 9.5%, the quota would have been reduced by 19.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#K00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>That is a 100% worse, not 10% worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#K00700","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>There would be 10% fewer prawns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#K00800","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>There is a big difference between the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#K00900","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The proposal without a quota uplift would have reduced the prawn catch by almost 20%.  As a result of the quota uplift, the reduction will be less than 10%.  Having said that, this does not take into account many of the other issues.  We are being forced to reach maximum sustainable yield for prawns next year.  Considering that prawns are the most important species for the Irish fishing industry bar none, including mackerel, if ever there was a case for socioeconomic management of a stock to reach a common destination by 2020, it should apply to prawns.  Prawns are worth more than &euro;100 million to the Irish fishing industry and most of our whitefish demersal boats rely on them.  This gives a sense of where we would be on prawns without quota uplift and where we are as a result of having quota uplift.<\/p> <p>  I have a considerable degree of faith in the science behind this, having become fairly familiar with the work of the Marine Institute over the past five years.  I am also aware of the institute's role in the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, at a very senior level.  I have great faith in what it says.  That is the basis for my arguments each year and that approach has worked reasonably well in recent years.  Consecutive cuts have not been introduced year after year.<\/p><p>There have been some big increases too.  The value of our overall quota in the past five years has increased, not decreased.  Different stocks have ups and downs and different sectors have ups and downs in terms of fishing zones, among other issues.  We will try to get the best outcome we can, working with the Marine Institute.  We have lost one key ally in someone who has gone to work for the Commission, but we still have a very strong team in the Marine Institute, and that will be very helpful.  Mr. Paul Savage is present today.<\/p><p> I am coming to BIM now.  In terms of the socioeconomic impact of the implementation of what is being proposed by the Commission, it would be a devastating blow in reality to be losing 200 to 300 people in the fishing industry and to have a significant reduction in numbers for some very important stocks.  The work BIM has done is very sobering and it will act as a motivator for me to make sure I get the best deal I can, as it has done in recent years also.<\/p><p> Most of the questions have been answered.  I assure the committee that we are not toeing anyone else's line, with regard to the comments that were made about Germany earlier.  When it comes to fishing we are very much doing our own thing and trying to get the best possible deal we can from an Irish perspective.<\/p><p> I thank those members who offered them for their good wishes for next week.  In many ways next week is like the budget for fishermen.  They will watch what the outcome is, as it will impact directly on their income levels and fishing opportunities for next year.  It is a hugely important time for the fishing industry.  In all the big ports, fishermen will be watching what comes out of Brussels next week.  I am under no illusions.  There is a lot of responsibility to try to get the best deal we can and to make sure we look after stocks in a responsible way as well.  I will meet the industry representatives again on Sunday night in Brussels before the negotiations start and I will stand over whatever deal we get by the middle of next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#K01000","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in to give us an overview.

On page 4 of the report, in section 2.1, it says that Russia announced an extension of the ban by a further six months to the end of January 2016.  That should say that the ban was extended by one year, to 6 August 2016.  I apologise for that error.<\/p> <p>  Members have before them the six-monthly report on developments in the EU for the period from January to June 2015.  The report outlines progress on EU agriculture issues under the Latvian Presidency, and I propose to provide the committee with an overview of the work carried out by the Department during this time.<\/p> <p>  Simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy was one of the main topics discussed during the first six months of the year, with Council conclusions agreed in May.  The main thrust of the conclusions was to identify those areas of the CAP most in need of simplification and to put pressure on the Commission to come up with simplification initiatives to address these areas.  The Commission progressed its simplification agenda by adopting two regulations: an implementing regulation which extended the date for applications under the basic payment scheme, and a delegated regulation which amended the rules for direct payments, allowing for more flexibility in the animal identification rules for coupled supports.<\/p> <p>  More recently, at the November meeting of the Council of Ministers for agriculture, Commissioner Hogan announced a package of measures to be addressed in the coming months.  These included a reduction in the rate of on-the-spot inspections in certain circumstances, changes to the definitions of young farmers and active farmers and changes to the number of annual amendments allowed in respect of rural development programmes.  The Commissioner also announced that a second package of modifications pertaining to greening was planned for mid-2016, with the relevant changes coming into effect from claim year 2017.<\/p> <p>  While we still await details of the proposed changes, we have generally welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s initiative, as it deals with many of the issues we have consistently raised.  We note the timeline proposed by the Commission to implement these measures, and have requested that this take place as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  As regards amendments to the rural development programmes, we are of the view that the current provision for one amendment per year is too restrictive, and we have welcomed the Commissioner&rsquo;s readiness to expand the number of possible amendments to three per year.  At the November Council of Ministers, Ireland's Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, also called on the Commission to introduce a fast-track mechanism for member states to deal with minor amendments to their rural development programme measures, and we hope to see further progress in this area in the near future.<\/p> <p>  A number of member states have called for the simplification exercise to be extended to the CAP basic Acts.  The Commission&rsquo;s focus has been on simplifying the delegated and implementing Acts, but Commissioner Hogan has recently signalled an open mind on reviewing the basic Acts also.<\/p><p>Ireland has not sought a reopening of the basic Acts at such an early stage of the implementation process.  We believe that much can be achieved from changes to the implementing and delegated Acts, together with a more reasonable and flexible approach from the Commission to its interpretation of the existing regulations.  It is an issue on which we will continue to work with the Commission and other member states in the coming months.<\/p><p> The Latvian Presidency also continued to monitor market developments across the EU, including the effects of the Russian ban on the importation of EU agricultural products.  Discussions in the first half of this year centred around the impact on the dairy sector, as well as the future of the EU sugar sector following the end of the quota regime in September 2017.  In the dairy sector, attention initially focused on the abolition of milk quotas from 1 April and how member states, including Ireland, would manage the repayment of the super levy bill, amounting to over &euro;71 million in Ireland.  The Commission introduced an implementing regulation which enabled member states to facilitate a phased repayment of super levy liabilities in respect of the 2014-15 milk year over three separate annual instalments, without interest.  The Department, following discussions with the relevant stakeholders, subsequently introduced the super levy instalment scheme.  Under this scheme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will raise a debt against the milk producer for the outstanding amount of the super levy bill, upon receipt of a formal application, and facilitate payment over three equal instalments.  Some 3,700 producers have availed of this facility.  That is just over half of those paying the super-levy.<\/p><p> More recently, however, the deteriorating market situation has dominated the agenda.  As the committee will be aware, a number of member states, including Ireland, called on the Commission to introduce further market measures to assist farmers in difficulties in the dairy and pigmeat sectors in particular.  In preparation for the extraordinary Council in September, Ireland put forward a six-point plan for consideration by the Commission.  Our proposals included an increase in the advance payment payable under the basic payment scheme, strengthened market supports through an increase in intervention prices and enhanced private storage schemes for cheese and pigmeat, and additional promotional measures for the dairy and pigmeat sectors, especially on third country markets.  In September, the Commission unveiled its &euro;500 million aid package.  This addressed the majority of our proposals - five out of the six.  A sum of &euro;13.73 million in direct aid was allocated to Ireland, with the possibility of a further national top-up of up to 100%.  The committee heard about that earlier from the Minister under the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister has been consulting with stakeholders in the interim as to how these funds should be utilised and he hopes to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard shortly.<\/p><p> Our rural development programme, RDP, was finally adopted by the Commission in May following a series of intensive bilateral discussions with it.  Prior to formal approval being granted, we received a letter of comfort from the Commission in April and this allowed us to progress with our plans to launch a number of measures contained in our rural development programme in line with the annual budgetary process.  We have now launched measures worth up to &euro;3.2 billion over the lifetime of the RDP, including the agri-environmental measures, areas of natural constraints, TAMS and, most recently, the organic farming scheme.  As to the remainder of the &euro;4 billion RDP fund, the ground work has been laid for commencement of our knowledge transfer schemes and these will start early in 2016, as will training for GLAS and beef genomics farmers.  We will also make a start before the year end on animal health and welfare training for on-farm advisers, with the remainder to be rolled out in 2016.  Next year will also see the launch of our locally-led schemes and our European innovation partnership, EIP, knowledge and productivity programmes.<\/p><p> On the international trade front, Ireland continues to support the Commission's efforts in progressing the trade agenda.  As a trading country, we have a clear national interest in this area and we recognise the benefits for the agrifood sector, in particular, that can be derived from international trade negotiations.  We favour a balanced approach, which acknowledges offensive interests as well as providing the means to deal effectively with defensive interests.  As regards the main areas of activity, the World Trade Organisation, WTO, ministerial conference in Nairobi takes place next week.  Attention here is focused on a potential mini-package incorporating agreement on export competition, support for least developed countries and transparency on rules.  Ireland very much supports the EU position that any discussion relating to export competition should encompass all four pillars - export subsidies, export credits, food aid and state trading enterprises - and not just export subsidies.  We look forward to progress being made in this area and we hope also for a consensus on the future direction of the Doha round post-Nairobi.<\/p><p> On the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, we wish to see momentum being maintained in the negotiations.  TTIP is of significant importance for Ireland and the EU.  Again, we are taking a balanced approach, given that there are offensive interests, especially in dairy and also in beef, as well as defensive interests, especially in beef, to be progressed.  We must also ensure, in light of the recent exchange of revised offers, that adequate attention is also paid to the dismantling of non-tariff barriers, which can often be of significant practical value.<\/p><p> I also wish to mention the prospect of a revival in the Mercosur negotiations, particularly following the recent election in Argentina.  The point has been made many times that these negotiations have the potential to give rise to negative consequences for agriculture in the EU.  They present a threat to the EU and to the Irish suckler beef sector in particular.  We will, therefore, continue to exercise extreme caution, monitor developments very closely and consult our own Government colleagues, with other member states and with the European Commission, as to the appropriate response to any movement in the negotiations.<\/p><p> An area of particular importance for Ireland is the role of agriculture and forestry in the climate change debate.  For Ireland, it is critically important that in the EU's climate and energy framework post-2020 we see recognition of the multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sectors, with their lower mitigation potential, and the need to ensure coherence between the EU's food security and climate change objectives, as agreed in the European Council Conclusions of October 2014.  In particular, securing recognition of the role that our forests play in carbon sequestration at EU level is critical.  Both agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF as it is known, should be included under the effort sharing decision which is expected next year.  This would encourage positive actions such as afforestation across the EU, as well as encouraging a more coherent approach to agriculture and land use.  The provisions relating to the accounting and reporting of emissions and removal of greenhouse gases from the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, are of particular interest to Ireland as they have an important role to play in the transition to a safe, sustainable and low-carbon future.  We strongly support an ambitious, legally-binding global agreement with broad participation as a core outcome of COP 21 in Paris, which will ensure that the EU's domestic transition to a low-carbon economy takes place in an agreed global context.<\/p><p> I will now turn to some of the legislative dossiers that were dealt with during the Latvian Presidency.  Discussions on the organics proposal continued into 2015.  The text of the proposal was revised substantially after it was re-examined at both political and technical level.  The issues that caused the most difficulties for member states included how to deal with the presence of non-authorised substances in organic products, the frequency of controls - notably annual versus risk-based controls - and the import regime, whether it should be based on compliance or equivalence.  The Latvian Presidency secured a general approach at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June, with the first trilogue discussions taking place on 19 November.  The Presidency is expected to provide an update on the progress of the organics dossier at the AGRIFISH Council next week and we look forward to hearing what it has to say.<\/p><p> Progress on the merging the school fruit and school milk schemes was suspended at the end of the Italian Presidency following disagreement between member states and the Commission on three key aspects of the proposal, namely, the legal basis, the scope and the allocation criteria.  The Commission undertook to evaluate the two schemes as part of the CAP simplification exercise and recommended that all work on the proposals be suspended pending the outcome of its evaluation.  Consequently, no discussions took place on this dossier at Council during the Latvian Presidency.  The dossier has progressed under the current Luxembourg Presidency, with three trilogue discussions taking place, most recently on 1 December.  The Presidency is keen to secure agreement on this proposal but the European Parliament continues to demand greater flexibility from the Council regarding the legal basis for a number of provisions in the regulations, including the total amount of aid allocated under the scheme, the criteria for the allocation of national envelopes and the transfer of allocations between schemes.  The Council has moved some way towards the European Parliament position and we look forward to hearing from the Presidency on the latest developments in this area next week.<\/p><p> There was some progress made on the so-called five-part animal and plant health package.  Compromise text on the animal health dossier was agreed at its first reading at trilogues with the European Parliament in June and is expected to be adopted in early 2016.  The plant reproductive material proposal, intended to consolidate and update the current 12 separate directives governing the sector, was withdrawn by the Commission in March following its rejection by the European Parliament in 2014.  The Commission is not expected to table an alternative proposal before 2016 at the earliest.  Work is continuing on the plant health and official controls dossiers.  The first element dealing with expenditure was agreed at the end of 2013.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a reference to the upcoming Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the final Council presided over by the Luxembourg Presidency before The Netherlands assumes the Presidency on 1 January.  It is customary for each Presidency to take stock of developments over the previous six months and this has been reflected in the agenda.  Of course, fisheries will dominate the agenda and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has spoken to the committee about that.  The remaining agenda items include progress reports and states of play on the various dossiers covered during the Luxembourg Presidency as well as information points from the Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>There is enough here to keep us going the whole session.

Will the witnesses look at this issue?  The lands for which the designation has come into place has, for practical purposes, excluded these farmers from the scheme.  I see that only three amendments are allowed per year but this should come under the minor amendments category as it is quite technical.  Ironically, to preserve these birds these people will put in seven or eight acres of bird cover in these areas and there will be 0.4 acres of bird cover for every acre they have for them to qualify, which makes no commercial sense on our productive wheat lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#N00400","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses envisage a further opening of GLAS into 2016?

I appreciate the point that it may extend into other areas where specific issues arise in regard to cereals.  I am willing to have a look in detail at whatever information members can give me on that.<\/p> <p>  I was asked if GLAS would be opened in 2016.  We expect that there will be at least 35,000 and up to 40,000 in GLAS by the end of the current tranche and, as members know, we intend to get up to 50,000.  Therefore, there will be further tranches of GLAS.  If a person has a problem with his BPS, it will be difficult to get into GLAS, but if there is a problem in a specific case, the Senator might let us know as it would be interesting to know about the experience, particularly if the problem was with the adviser.<\/p> <p>  We probably do not have time to go into TTIP because, as the Deputy said, it deserves a good airing.  TTIP is a more complex issue for our sector than for others.  We see very significant benefits for the agrifood sector in TTIP and there is a growing recognition of this throughout the sector.  It is most obviously the case in dairy and there are benefits from a deal in TTIP in a range of dairy products, both by lowering tariffs and removing non-tariff barriers that restrict or hinder our dairy exports into the US, which have very significant potential.  There is also potential in other areas such as consumer foods.<\/p> <p>  On the beef side, the issue with TTIP has become more balanced and nuanced.  Two or three years ago or more people would have exclusively seen the negatives on it but now they see that there are both positives and negatives and one has to weigh these up.  We hope to get access to the US market for manufacturing beef, which is a significant prize because the Americans eat a lot of manufactured beef and grind an enormous amount - some 80% - of their beef.  Their prices for manufacturing beef tend to be higher than European prices so there could be a very valuable market for manufacturing beef in the US.  There could also, paradoxically, be a market at the top end - the so-called white tablecloth restaurants - for Irish grass-fed steaks along the east coast of the US, which carries a big premium.  On the other hand, we would face competition from imports of general steak cuts into this country from the US.  The detail will be crucial, such as how high the quotas would be, assuming a tariff rate quota would apply.  How big a quota would the Americans get and what would be the structure of that quota?  How big a quota would we get in the US?  This is a very important point which people have not sufficiently understood.  When we have access to the US market, we are caught inside a 55,000 tonne quota that extends to a whole heap of countries and is mainly filled by Latin Americans.  We could very easily bump up against the quota limits there.  I assume we would get an exclusive EU quota under a TTIP arrangement.  It is a bit more complicated on the beef side than it was in the past and there are pluses and minuses.  Overall, we see significant benefits for the agrifood sector from TTIP.<\/p> <p>  How long does the Chairman want me to speak for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Senator Comiskey has a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#N00700","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>What about the risk of hormones in American beef?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#N00800","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>We have a draft paper which the Senator will not have seen yet.<\/p><p>We are still awaiting confirmation from the Whips of whether we will be allowed to have the contents of that paper considered and put as a motion on the floor of the Houses so that they can be approved before they go to Europe.

We need to stay on message regarding what we are trying to achieve here.  Our message needs to be based on facts.  This has been summarised as a global effort, as opposed to a national or EU effort.

It is certainly appropriate for this committee to engage in it too.  I agree with what the Chairman said about the variable treatment of this issue in the media.  We recently invited a range of people from the media into the Department for a briefing on climate change to try to get them to understand the facts.  There is a great deal of misinformation out there, unfortunately.  Some of this stuff is a bit complicated.  I think those who came to the briefing were quite impressed by it.  We will continue to try to get people in the media to understand the facts - I should not use the word \"educate\" - before they write articles about climate change.  As the Chairman said, the Government has a clear position on hormone beef.  It is completely opposed to any question of allowing imports of hormone beef.  The Commission is pursuing that line.  It is constantly reassuring us that it will hold that line.

If there are questions about progress with payments, I might defer to my colleagues.  I thank the committee for giving me an opportunity to update it on the progress that is being made with the beef data and genomics programme, or BDGP.  As Deputies will be aware, the BDGP was launched by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on 5 May 2015.  The BDGP forms part of Ireland's current rural development programme, which runs from 2014 to 2020.  This programme, which is known as the RDP, has funding of &euro;300 million over its lifespan.<\/p> <p>  The BDGP builds on previous investment in suckler farming through schemes such as the nationally funded beef data programme and the beef genomics scheme.  Suckler farming is the only sector in the RDP with its own targeted RDP scheme.  The principal objective of the BDGP scheme is to encourage the introduction of animals of a higher genetic merit into the national beef herd.  This will reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of beef production in Ireland by improving production efficiency on suckler farms.  We know there is a particular spotlight on the role the agriculture sector plays in national emissions.  The Minister has made it clear that the agriculture sector is not looking for a free ride on the backs of the efforts of other sectors, but must be willing to adapt and innovate in response to environmental imperatives.  The BDGP is exactly the kind of innovative and meaningful response the sector requires if Irish agriculture is to lay claim to being among the most sustainable in the world.<\/p> <p>  The BDGP is an important vehicle for improving production efficiency and profitability on suckler farms.  Of course there are many factors affecting profitability, including global demand and supply, exchange rates and input costs.  Neither farmers nor the State can have any significant control over these factors.  However, there has been significant Exchequer investment through the provision of research, advice and education by Teagasc, the provision of funding for knowledge transfer to farmers and the provision of funding for the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, which can help to increase profitability and output and reduce input costs at farm level.  Research, innovation, technology adoption and education will have a critically important role to play in improving the lot of suckler farmers.  The focus has to be strategic.  Poor profitability in the beef sector is not a new phenomenon and will not be resolved by short-term measures.  Improving the genetics of the beef herd will have a long-term and cumulative impact.<\/p> <p>  In designing the BDGP, the Department took the best available scientific advice on the steps needed to improve the genetics of the beef sector.  Fertility is key.  On average, Irish beef farmers produce just eight calves for every ten cows at present.  Farmers are keeping non-productive animals on their farms - they are feeding them, housing them, vaccinating and bearing all of the costs associated with them - even though such animals are not contributing to the profits of farms at all.  When the calving interval of over 400 days, which is increasing, is considered, it is clear that something needs to be done.  The best advice from experts in Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation is that the predominant focus on terminal traits needs to be adjusted so that a more rounded multi-trait breeding strategy can be pursued.<\/p><p>Representatives from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, came before the committee recently and explained the possible improvements in genetics.  Improving the genetic profile of the suckler herd should result in more calves per cow per year, better cow survival rates, more mother's milk for calves before weaning, reduced calving intervals and reduced age at first calving.  These are all critical success factors for suckler farming.  The key focus is to look at profitability over the lifetime of the suckler cow and the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, is designed with these objectives in mind.<br\/><br\/>I set out the requirements of the scheme in June, and I will not go into the same detail as before, but just to recap, farmers will be required to record calving data on the animal events sheet.  This is in addition to normal tagging and registration requirements, and it can be completed online or through the animal events book provided by the ICBF.  They must also complete surveys on important traits in the maternal index, such as milking ability and docility.  This is vital information for the database behind the breeding indexes that are developed by the ICBF and will strengthen the robustness of the breeding advice provided to farmers.  Farmers must also carry out genotyping on selected animals within their herds.  This involves tagging an animal and returning the genomic sample.  They must ensure a percentage of the female animals on their farms are of the highest quality, four or five-star, with regard to the replacement or maternal index.  They must also ensure there is a four or five-star stock bull on either the terminal or replacement index.  This requirement is phased in over time.  They must also complete a carbon navigator with an approved adviser and attend a training course on all aspects of the BDGP in 2016.  The Department along with the ICBF and other relevant agencies will provide long-term support for participants on the scheme and advice on the requirements in the programme.  Farmers should not hesitate to get in contact if they have any queries.<br\/><br\/>With regard to progress on the scheme, the Department has received 29,780 applications, having extended the closing date by an additional week to 5 June.  Approval letters were issued to scheme participants in August, at the same time as a detailed ICBF report on their herd profile.  As of Friday last, approximately 2,900 herds have withdrawn from the scheme, though some of these have subsequently asked to re-enter.  Withdrawals from a scheme such as this are, of course, not unusual, particularly when one considers the simple application procedure and the high volume of applicants.  There are eligibility issues with a further approximately 500 applicants, which are being worked through at present.  The withdrawal rate is broadly in line with previous suckler herd schemes, including the suckler cow welfare scheme and the beef genomic scheme.<br\/><br\/>At this stage, the 26,321 herds which are fully eligible for the scheme are working hard to meet the implementation requirements.  Almost all of the tags required for genomic sampling have been sent to herd owners and, to date, 275,800 tags have been returned.  This accounts for 83% percent of herd owners in the scheme.  A total of 17,613 applicants have submitted survey forms by post, and a further 5,672 applicants have completed their surveys online.  Therefore, an overall total of 23,285 participants have submitted some or all of their survey data.  To be eligible for a payment in 2015, applicants must have submitted at least 60% of the required survey data and completed 90% of the required genomic sampling.  As of last Friday, more than 16,000 applicants met this basic test for payment in 2015.  Payments will simply roll into 2016 as farmers meet their compliance obligations.  There is no question of people who are paid in December having to wait until the end of next year to be paid.  The payments will roll on through January and there will be regular payment runs as additional data comes in.  This is an important point.<br\/><br\/>The educational component of the scheme is a critical element.  Building awareness among applicants of the importance of the correct genetics and providing them with a roadmap on how to achieve the best results will be key.  A request for tenders for the training element of the scheme has closed, and while the successful tenderer has been notified we are now in the statutory cooling-off period of 14 days before the tender can be awarded.  This training will not cost the farmer anything, and he or she will receive &euro;166 for completing the course.  This is in addition to the normal per hectare payments under the scheme.  Farmers will also need advice on the completion of the carbon navigator.  A list of advisers that applicants will be able to call upon to assist in completion of their carbon navigator requirement will be sent to herd owners in the new year.  This will also be free of charge to the farmer.<br\/><br\/>The Department proposes to commence payments in December, with further payment runs following on at regular intervals in 2016 as applicants reach the compliance requirements after the first payment run has been completed.  Farmers who have completed their full genotyping requirements and submitted their survey data on animals born up to the 30 June this year will be paid in December, following successful completion of the area-based crosscheck with their basic payment scheme application and completion of the required regulatory inspections as appropriate.  The payment is calculated at &euro;142.50 for the first 6.66 ha and &euro;120 for each hectare thereafter, up to a maximum payable hectarage.  In essence, this approximates to &euro;95 for the first ten calved cows and &euro;80 for each additional calved cow.  I explained previously that when we went to the Commission with the scheme we had the very simple idea of paying for actions, but the only available article under the rural development regulation for a payment of this nature was article 28, which is the environmental article, and payments under this must be on an area basis.  We were then required to come up with a coefficient for translating what we had intended to be an action-based payment to a hectare-based payment.  This is how the &euro;95 and &euro;80 payments were reached.<br\/><br\/>The maximum payable hectarage is calculated by dividing the number of calved cows in the herd in 2014, the reference amount, by a standard stocking rate of 1.5 calved cows per hectare.  On the basis of this stocking rate, the vast majority of farmers have far more land than they require to obtain the maximum payment under the scheme.  Almost half of farmers have a stocking rate of 0.5 or less and 90% have a stocking rate of less than one.  For example, an average farmer with ten cows and a stocking rate of 0.5 will have 20 ha but he or she will require less than seven of these for full payment under the scheme.  Farmers were concerned that their land would be tied up for six years under the scheme but for the vast majority of farmers to attract the fully payment they will need only a very small proportion of their land and they can do what they like with the rest.  They can sell it or lease it if they wish.<br\/><br\/>We we last came before the committee we spoke about communications, and members correctly said it is a very important part of the scheme.  This is complicated and farmers need to be managed carefully and we need to bring them into the mindset.  The Department, with the ICBF and Teagasc, has concluded a nationwide series of 12 information meetings for participants in the scheme.  These meetings were all extremely well attended.  The feedback was positive and, importantly, farmers had the opportunity to discuss their own herd on a one to one basis with the ICBF and the Department.  At the ploughing championships we met farmers who were quite concerned about their ability to comply with the scheme, but they went away quite reassured when we dealt with them on a one to one basis and examined the profile of their herd.  This type of communication has taken place and it will continue.  Such close engagement with farmers will be critical as the scheme progresses.  The Department has also published on its website an extended frequently asked questions document using the questions raised at the various information meetings.  The ICBF has been in direct contact with farmers, as has Teagasc which has run several farm walks on the scheme and will do so again next year.  The ICBF has a series of information articles in <i>The Farmer's Journal<\/i>every week.  There is much information and communication.<br\/><br\/>The Minister committed to establishing a monitoring group of relevant stakeholders and this group held its first meeting on Friday, 27 November.  Attendees included farming organisations, the ICBF, Teagasc and the Department.  The group will continue to review the operation of the scheme and the intention is to reconvene in early 2016.  The work of this monitoring group can feed into the planned mid-term review of the BDGP.  The idea is to see how the scheme operates - it is up and running - and whether any operational anomalies or difficulties arise.  We will try to adjust the scheme as necessary, to the extent it is possible to do so.  We must bear in mind this scheme has been approved by the Commission and we are anxious to keep it moving.  Commission approval involved not only engagement with DG Agriculture and Rural Development but also DG Environment and DG Climate Action.  It was complicated to get it through.<br\/><br\/>The BDGP is established and has a strong cohort of participants.  The first payments under the scheme will issue this month.  Payment runs will continue into January as participants comply with the scheme.  The Department, along with the ICBF and Teagasc, is committed to continuous engagement with the scheme participants for the duration of the programme, which is very important, to assist them in maximising their gain under the scheme.  I am happy to discuss any issues that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015120800002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gleeson for his presentation and the officials for attending.

That did happen but it has been addressed and I think those who are reconsidering are probably doing so because of that.<\/p> <p>  There were many discussion groups - I was part of one - in respect of knowledge transfer, and there are two main concerns.  One is that people cannot participate in two groups such as, say, a sheep group and a beef group.  That is not to say they should get paid in both but they should at least be allowed to participate because many of them are dual dry stock farmers.  The other is that the named applicant cannot designate a nominee.<\/p> <p>  Following on from what Senator Comiskey said and what was said on climate change, we may only end up with about 27,000 fully compliant although the aim was much higher.

On the 30,000 participants, the experience with previous schemes has been that we have had about that many participants.  Under this scheme, had we had more participants than we could afford, we would have had to apply selection criteria and exclude people from the scheme.  There will be payments this year.  I understand the Minister, when he was before the committee, mentioned &euro;35 million.  Payments will roll over into next year.  My best assessment of the payments next year is that they will be at least &euro;48 million and maybe a little bit more.<\/p> <p>  Members have asked me about new farmers.  In a way, that is a policy question and I cannot answer it.  However, my best assessment for next year is that the &euro;52 million will be fully spent.  We also have training components next year that have to be paid from this fund.  This engagement with farmers, which will be free of charge to them, is very important.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right that payments under this scheme could run into the next programming period with n+2 - I think it is n+3 now.  I can say that it is technically possible to bring people into the scheme up to the middle of 2017 and pay six years, some of which would come from the EU programmes.  That is a technical possibility but the decision on whether to do it will depend on the budget available and the Minister, whoever is in place at the time.<\/p> <p>  On the question of increasing payments, this is a rural development scheme and is not intended to be a direct payment or income support scheme.  Rural development schemes are built up on the basis of costs incurred or income forgone.  When we came up with these payments, we had to impute very carefully the costs of genotyping, taking samples, going to courses and the various components.  We then had to impute an overhead associated with that.  It was those individual elements of the payment that justified it to the Commission.  That was critical.  We could not just arbitrarily increase the payment if more funding was available.  We would have to find additional actions to justify an increase, go back to the Commission and negotiate something different.  That would be a tall order.<\/p> <p>  On the question of moving down to three or four stars, we agonised long and hard over it.  I will come back to the objective of the scheme.  From a domestic point of view there is significant interest in increasing profitability on beef farms.  If we are to do that, we want to be ambitious about our aim.  Perhaps more important than that, we had to get this through DG Environment and DG Climate Action.  We had our environmental experts pore over the scheme and work out the positive carbon impact of moving up to four or five stars.  We cannot just arbitrarily move the goalposts now.  To do so would require us not only to go back to DG Agriculture and Rural Development but also go back to DG Environment and DG Climate Action as well.  I have said this before and want to be careful of what I say.  This was a leap for these guys.  The beef sector in any country and in Ireland especially has a particular environmental image.  Getting to grips with the idea that a subvention to the beef sector could also be an environmental measure was a big leap for DG Environment and particularly for DG Climate Action.  We would have to go back and explain we wanted to move the goalposts and make it easier for people to comply.  I cannot stress enough how difficult that would be.  We would be opening a can of worms which we succeeding in closing a year ago.

Given that beef production accounts for half or more of that output, this scheme provides defensive ammunition going into the climate change debate, as well as the fact we actually took a first step in it.

I do not wish to overemphasise it but we have positioned ourselves as a food producing nation in a particular space in terms of quality, environment and so forth.  Apart from assisting us in terms of the climate change debate, this is a useful tool in the context of the market.  Large multiple retailers have corporate social responsibility strategies and they all want to get their produce from sustainable sources.  This programme is a world first in that regard.  It is part of the Origin Green message that Aidan Cotter, chief executive of Bord Bia, has told the committee about before.  It is multifunctional in a way.

This Supplementary Estimate will provide funding to address the exclusion by the EU Commission of &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven year period from 2008 to 2014.  It will provide for a transfer of savings from certain areas of the Vote to fund expenditure under the fisheries harbour scheme, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the world food programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment.  It will also provide an increase of &euro;39 million in the Department's permitted net expenditure to deal with a Commission decision, applying to all member states, to delay payment of some of their expected 2015 rural development receipts.<\/p> <p>  In mid-November the EU Commission adopted a decision to exclude a total of &euro;278 million from 18 member states.  The net Irish disallowance amounted to &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven year period 2008 to 2014, inclusive.  This consists of two elements; a &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 to 2012 and a &euro;3.6 million exclusion for 2013 and 2014.  It represents 0.57% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven year period.  The exclusions relate mainly to Commission findings that some aspects of Irish control systems are insufficiently robust in excluding ineligible land from payments to farmers and EU funded schemes.  Other significant exclusions in the EU Commission's decision include &euro;53 million for the Netherlands, &euro;51 million for Italy and &euro;37.9 million for the UK.<\/p> <p>  This decision is the outcome of a prolonged process which began with a proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million for Ireland for the five years 2008 to 2012, suggested by the Commission in May 2014.  At the outset the Department opposed the application of the proposed flat rate correction and sought a hearing with the EU conciliation body.  The conciliation body acknowledged the amount of work done by the Department in reviewing over 900,000 land parcels using the land parcel identification system to identify and exclude ineligible areas in order to calculate the risk to the fund.  The report of the conciliation body in early 2015 concluded that the Commission and the Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to a settlement.<\/p> <p>  During the year the Department undertook considerable additional work at the request of the Commission to give assurances to the calculated risk and it was subject to further verification and audit by Commission officials in May 2015.  The reduction of over 60% in the final correction clearly indicates the Commission's acceptance of the Irish approach.  It is important that this disallowance be considered in its proper context and in the manner in which other member states have performed in this respect.  Since 2004, statistics have been collated which place Ireland in the best performing quartile of EU member states in this regard.  A figure of 0.9% of total EU expenditure has been subject to disallowance in Ireland since 2004, a significantly lower figure than the EU average of 1.96%.  The Department already has approximately &euro;3 million set aside in the Vote as a contribution to this disallowance and that, along with the additional &euro;65 million sought here today, will be used to address the implementation of EU funding.<\/p><p> While my Department has collected some &euro;4 million in respect of overpayments but not penalties, following the review of land parcels, my clear preference at this stage is that the cost of the disallowance be borne by the State.  This would be in line with similar decisions taken by many other member states on disallowances applied to their EU funds.  There are a number of technical and accounting issues that arise which are secondary to the need to clear the disallowance, which is now a mature liability, being discussed.  I have asked my officials to examine the matters involved. <\/p><p> On additional payments relating to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme, the World Food Programme and the EU market volatility top-up payment, I am also seeking the committee's approval to use savings in the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure, while not changing the total allocation for the Vote.  The proposed transfers and expenditure involve relatively significant changes to the original 2015 Vote allocations and it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.  Specifically, I am seeking to transfer funding into existing subheads for the World Food Programme, areas of natural constraints and fishery harbours.  I also wish to establish a new subhead in the Vote for a top-up on the EU market volatility payment.  The &euro;35.74 million in current funds and &euro;3.5 million in capital funds required would be transferred from various subheads where, owing to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the beef data and genomics programme, the seafood development programme and across a food safety, animal health and welfare programme.  <\/p><p> The beef data and genomics programme is part of Ireland's rural development programme.  There are 27,000 farmers in the programme which aims, over a six year period, to develop through a rounded multi-trait breeding strategy a national beef herd characterised by higher genetic merit animals.  The aim is that this would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions per kilo of output but would also result in improved production efficiency.  For 2015, the first year of the programme, the allocation was &euro;52 million.  However, payments are expected to total &euro;35 million, yielding savings of &euro;17 million.  This is primarily because a significant percentage of the applicants will not have confirmed completion of their requirement to submit performance data for calves up to five months of age owing to the timing of calvings on their holdings.  Hence, they cannot be paid in the final 2015 payment run to December.  Payments, however, will issue early in 2016 to these applicants with late calvings as they confirm their compliance with the requirements for 2015 born calves.  In other words, farmers are receiving these payments, but it is bridging from December into January and from one year into the next.  It is not the case that farmers are losing anything.  They will be getting it a few weeks later because their calves were born a few weeks later.  I understand one of my colleagues will be present later to discuss the beef data scheme in some detail. <\/p><p> Some &euro;9 million was allocated in 2015 to meet current expenditure on the EMMF seafood development programme.  It is anticipated that savings will arise owing to delays in the adoption by the Commission of the operational programme which, in turn, has delayed the launch of the new schemes by the Department.  I am delighted to announce that our comprehensive &euro;241 million investment package for the seafood sector has been adopted in law by the Commission and that the programme can now be implemented in full.  This has just happened within the past two days.  My Department has been working for some time towards this with stakeholders and the State agencies that will deliver the programme.  I expect schemes to be rolled out from the beginning of 2016 to assist seafood enterprises to substantially grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in coastal communities.  The seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to the economy.  I am aiming to achieve &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020.  It is expected that expenditure of &euro;1.9 million will be achieved in 2015, allowing for a saving of &euro;7.1 million.<\/p><p> It is also anticipated that savings of just more than &euro;6 million will be achieved in the animal health and welfare area owing to a reduced incidence of disease.<\/p><p>This is a very positive story.  These savings are mostly in the TB and brucellosis eradication area, where progress at reducing the incidence of TB has been maintained and the positive brucellosis situation continues.  Expenditure on the control of horses scheme is also lower this year and there is a small reduction in the fallen animal scheme costs.  Again, this is connected to positive animal husbandry and a lower incidence of disease.  Almost &euro;4 million in savings is expected from Teagasc and Bord Bia.  These relate to savings on the 2015 pension allocation for these organisations, possibly as a result of the extension of the grace period for public sector retirements.  Other savings are in the early retirement scheme and rural development technical assistance.  Overall these current expenditure savings amount to just in or about &euro;35 million and these savings, with the committee's approval, will be transferred to fund a number of measures.<\/p><p> The World Food Programme, WFP, is a United Nations organisation responsible for the delivery of food assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. It partners with other United Nations agencies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, civil society and the private sector to enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food needs.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the lead Department in Ireland's engagement with the WFP.  In recent years, my Department has provided &euro;9.96 million in core multilateral funding to WFP.  This amount is included in the Department's voted allocation.<\/p><p> On 6 September, Ireland co-hosted with Italy an event at Expo15 in Milan to promote the work of the World Food Programme and encourage donors to optimise their support for WFP by providing unearmarked funds to allow the WFP maximise flexibility to provide rapid responses to crises such as the Syrian refugee crisis.  At the event, I made a commitment on behalf of Ireland to double its core annual multilateral contribution to WFP from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million for the next three years.  This commitment is a key commitment of the Government's enhanced and increased response to the ongoing refugee crisis associated with the conflict in Syria and represents a significant part of Ireland's contribution to the European Union's response to the refugee crisis.<\/p><p> In response to a significant price deterioration for primary producers in the dairy and pig sectors this year, the European Commission proposed a package of support measures worth &euro;500 million.  The Commissioner did a great job in that regard.  Dairy prices in Ireland have dropped by 21% in the past 12 months and dairy farm incomes are expected to be down by up to 50% in 2015 compared to last year.  This package of support measures was agreed by the Council of Ministers at its September meeting.  Some &euro;420 million of the funding is to fund direct aid for primary producers in the dairy and pig sectors.  This funding was divided among member states based on certain criteria and Ireland's allocation was &euro;13.7 million.<\/p><p> To reflect the fact that the package is intended to only partly cover the losses suffered by primary producers, the regulation allows for member states to supplement the allocation by up to 100%, which is, in Ireland's case, an additional &euro;13.7 million of national funding.  I am proposing to fund this national element with the savings on the 2015 Vote.  Given the severity of the income decline, this additional national allocation will help to alleviate the risk coming in the pivotal period immediately after a quota abolition.  This decline would undermine the potential contribution of the dairy sector to sustainable growth in output and employment in rural areas.<\/p><p> Deputies will be aware of the importance of the scheme of support for those farming in areas of natural constraints, heretofore referred to as the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I am seeking the committee's approval to increase the 2015 allocation to this scheme to cover payments to farmers which relate to previous years.  Payments under the ANC scheme start in late September but payments to some participants inevitably spill over into the next calendar year for various reasons.<\/p><p>It will inevitably spill over into the next calendar year for various reasons.  That happens with schemes and it is happening with the beef scheme now.  Accordingly the accumulated spillover from the 2013 and 2014 schemes into the 2015 financial year results in &euro;195 million provided in 2015 being inadequate to fund all of the liabilities.  The introduction in 2015 of the new islands category within the ANC under the RDP must also be accommodated.<\/p><p> On the capital expenditure side of the Vote, some savings will arise from the farm safety scheme, the final scheme to be launched in TAMS 1.  I introduced the scheme in response to a number of farm debts last year - far too many unfortunately.  While the scheme proved popular with approximately 4,500 approvals, expenditure has lagged behind as not all farmers approved had submitted claims by the scheme closing date in September.  I have provided again for the safety measures under the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme in the new TAMS 2, which was opened to applicants in recent months.<\/p><p> Some &euro;11.5 million was originally allocated to fisheries harbour centres in 2015.  However, additional funding of &euro;6.8 million has been required to complete the necessary capital works, &euro;5.1 million of which has been found within the fisheries subhead.  The additional &euro;3.5 million required will, with the committee's approval, come from the unspent TAMS fund.  The extra funding requirement is due in part to expenditure this year on some projects connected to storm damage that occurred in 2014: a delayed &euro;6.4 million expenditure on a major dredging project in Dunmore East, planned for 2014 but which must now be funded in 2015; the local authorities harbour development programme; and the local authorities storm damage programme.<\/p><p> As well as having economic and developmental benefits in remote coastal areas, much of the work undertaken on harbours has health and safety advantages for seafarers and others.  The Department's budgeted total appropriations-in-aid for 2015 come to &euro;469 million, the vast bulk of which represents claims in respect of rural development expenditure for 2014 and 2015.  It is now forecast that &euro;430 million will be accounted for as appropriations-in-aid, which would represent a shortfall of &euro;39 million in current receipts.  This shortfall is due to a decision by the European Commission in mid-November that due to a higher than expected expenditure on new programmes in all member states, there would be insufficient EU funds available to pay all rural development claims fully in 2015.  Obviously, that posed a problem for us because we had anticipated that money would come in.<\/p><p> It was announced that for member states' 2014 to 2020 rural development programme claims made in November 2015 a payment of one third would now be made in 2015, with the remaining two thirds to follow early in 2016.  The November claims receipt would have been received in December 2015 and is critical to allow the Department to balance its net expenditure in line with voted expenditure figures for the year.  The Commission decision creates a shortfall which this Supplementary Estimate will now address.<\/p><p> The Commission has assured member states that these receipts, which are not being paid in 2015, are protected and will be paid in 2016 from the EU 2016 budget.  Our 2016 Revised Estimates, which will be published this month, will show an increase in appropriations-in-aid, above that which was produced in the Estimates Volume, to reflect this.  Hence the issue is one of timing rather than amount to be recouped.<\/p><p> The amount being sought from the D&aacute;il is &euro;104 million and is essential for my Department to deal with the issues I have just outlined.  I earnestly recommend the committee to give its support.  I will obviously try to provide clarification or answer any questions members might have.  I am conscious that this is a much bigger Supplementary Estimate than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine would normally have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#E00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Presumably, the Department had a profile of calving patterns and knew how many cows would calve after 1 July.<\/p><p>The Minister has argued that the reason for the shortfall was late calving rather than farmers not inputting all the data.  The Department knows from calving patterns that a certain number of cattle calve after 1 July.  Based on its data, what is the ratio of calves born after 1 July compared to the number of calves born before 1 July?  How many animals or hectares - the use of hectares in the scheme is a fiction used for the European Union - did the Department expect the scheme to cover?  The figure of &euro;17 million appears to be a gross miscalculation by it, particularly if it is still claiming that the scheme will be fully subscribed.  My suspicion is that &euro;52 million will not be spent under the scheme in any calendar year.  Is the Minister sticking to the view that when the full year returns have been made, &euro;52 million will have been spent under the scheme or does he accept that there will be an underspend in the long term, unless it is reopened?  We need the truth on that issue.  <\/p><p> I note that provision is made for increased expenditure on the areas of natural constraints scheme.  Is the underspend on the scheme one of the reasons the Department is behind schedule in its payments to date?  If it expects to exceed the provision for the scheme by such a large amount - approximately &euro;20 million - how does it propose to shovel out so many payments to farmers in the remaining 19 days of the year, especially given its inability to make payments this year to farmers who have been roaring down the telephone every day looking for their money?  What is the actual expenditure under the areas of natural constraints scheme?<\/p><p> As the Minister correctly noted, many farmers will not receive their areas of natural constraints payment for 2015 this year.  Why is there such a discrepancy between the figures for previous years and the figure to be carried over into next year?  Does the Minister understand the point I am trying to make?  It does not appear logical that the Department needs a significant amount of additional money this year because one would expect the unspent amount at the end of any given year to be roughly equivalent to the additional amount spent in the early part of the year to meet payments not made in the previous year.  As such, one should not need to provide a lot of additional money for the scheme.<\/p><p> What is the estimated additional cost for the islands?

I hope that, whatever the hue of the next Government, it will adopt the same positive attitude.<\/p> <p>  This is an important issue because if taxpayers had not picked up the tab for this additional allocation, it would have been levied on farmers.  That is the story and it comes as a major relief to farmers.  Members were giving out hell about eyes in the sky and various other measurements officials were taking.  There was a legitimate expectation that everything would be done right.  I salute the Minister for taking action in this regard and I am pleased this has been achieved.  Thankfully, the economy has recovered to the extent that he is able to provide this funding.  Four or five years ago, he would not have been given one cent for this purpose.  From that perspective, this funding is welcome and I congratulate the Minister on securing it.<\/p> <p>  The initial figure was much larger, but the Minister and his officials brought the Commission around to accepting the bona fides of their argument for a reduction.  From that viewpoint, while I can be as critical as the next person, I like to speak up when a job has been done well.  Irish farmers will benefit from this achievement and I congratulate everybody concerned.  <\/p> <p>  Initially, there were negative vibes about the beef data and genomics scheme and attempts were made to throw it off course.  I stood 100% behind the scheme because I believe strongly that upgrading our herds is the only way to win high value markets.  I know this to be the case from a suckler cow herder in my area.  I advocated and exhorted farmers not to be taken in by criticisms of the scheme.  While there is an element of red tape involved, people will accept it if they see returns of &euro;150 or &euro;200.  The number of farmers participating in the scheme is approximately 3,000 lower than I expected.  Red tape may be part of the problem, although I know that age is also a factor, as are changes in applicable years and so forth.  I urge the Minister to ensure the scheme will not be short-changed next year and that sufficient money will be provided for it.  <\/p> <p>  My only criticism relates to the targeted agricultural measures scheme, TAMS.  I am not criticising what the Minister is doing as I regard the TAMS as a very good scheme.<\/p><p>A notorious number of farmers have planning permission and have been ready to go but there is no sign of approvals.  The Government is in its dying days.  A lot of farmers would lose out up to 40% if they went ahead.  I would say to the Minister as well that it is an attractive buy.  I accept it is a matter of numbers, but I know of some dairy farmers who are trying to get work done but who did not get approvals, and they were extremely disappointed.<\/p><p> We are trying to constantly upgrade.  It is important in the overall context of all of the debates, for example, in terms of what is going on in Paris at the world climate conference.  We must try to ensure that we meet the dates in any schemes we bring forward, from the departmental end as much as from the applicant's end.  The Department is in a position of strength.  The applicant is always in the weaker position and has to try to comply with all eligibility conditions, which are onerous, as they should be, to ensure that money is well spent.<\/p><p> Like Deputy Martin Ferris, I welcome the funding for the World Food Programme.  The Minister gave a commitment in that regard and he probably did not expect to be doubling it so quickly, but he did well here.  I certainly would support that.  We are entitled to make that contribution.  Hopefully, it will help those who have been suffering a great deal in terms of being dislodged from their environment, being relocated and becoming refugees.  I genuinely support that provision.<\/p><p> On the market volatility payment, the Chairman has been careful to bring in all the interested bodies, especially the dairy sector, to discussed this.  We have had representatives from the banks before the committee and others and have exhorted them to be fair to the farmers.  Of course, the banks gave great promises and we will watch them with interest to see that they adhere to the commitments they have given.  The Minister has matched it 100%, up the maximum that he is allowed.  The farmers should acknowledge that.<\/p><p> On areas of natural constraint, I note, like Deputy Martin Ferris, that those concerned about the hen harriers were in here and made a cogent and powerful case which we supported.  I hope the Minister can find some way to facilitate within one of those budgetary heads their legitimate desire to farm their lands, which are circumscribed by the imposition that has been dealing with the hen harrier, including the SACs and SPAs.<\/p><p> All in all, I welcome the announcement here today.

It is encouraging, when one sees the overall figure for disallowances around Europe, that we are way below the average.  It is 0.49% in Ireland and the overall EU average is 1.96%.  That is, I suppose, how we end up where we are today.  No doubt it would have been a bad news story if we could not come up with this funding for the farmers.  It is a huge relief that they will not be liable for it.<\/p> <p>  I will return to a point made by a previous speaker on the volatility in the market.  Deputy Penrose previously mentioned the volatility in the dairy sector.  It is welcome that there was a good package put in place by the Commission and now the Minister is matching that funding by 100%.  When does he propose to it to the farmers?<\/p> <p>  The dairy sector is in a volatile situation.  It could be the beef sector next year and the tillage sector or another sector the following year.  We are in an era of continuous volatility.  Are there plans in the Department to have a fund in place to cover such eventualities for the future?  It might be something worth considering in the event that there is a downward spiral in the future.<\/p> <p>  Regarding, in particular, Teagasc, and Bord Bia, I note in the Minister's presentation that the spend in Teagasc is 2% less, which is put down to there being fewer retirements.<\/p><p>Considering that Teagasc is going through a growth spurt with three times the normal number of students coming into the colleges and the expectation is that it will continue that way, should there be an increase rather than a reduction in spending or is it solely down to the retirement of staff?  I was of the opinion that there are extra staff required as well.  Extra staff were taken on board in Teagasc, particularly from an education point of view.  The Minister might clarify that point.<\/p><p> On beef data, it is encouraging that a significant number of farmers have signed up to the scheme after much initial confusion.  There has been a certain degree of flexibility in the scheme.  On the point Deputy Penrose made about the number of farmers who are still not in the scheme, will there be a review of the new scheme to cover any anomalies that may exist?<\/p><p> Finally, as regards the farm safety scheme that the Minister announced last year, he states that some farmers did not enter the original scheme and were waiting for the bigger scheme.  It is the small matters in farm safety that catch farmers.  It happens to every farm.  Even though the big scheme covers a lot of matters, is there a plan to have a continuous knowledge-based farm safety scheme for the future?  Knowledge is the key to farm safety.<\/p><p> Those, more or less, are my points.  I again welcome the fact that Irish farmers will not be held liable for the extra liabilities.  There is considerable relief about it.  It is not too often that there is a reasonably good news story.  From that point of view, I welcome it and compliment the Minister on ensuring that the farmers will not be liable for the extra liabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#M00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>There are two quick points I would like to make following on from points that were made by others.  One is on beef data.  If, as may be the case, it pans out that there is an ongoing underspend and the provision of &euro;52 million turns out not to be met, would the Minister consider providing a similar scheme to improve quality based on the same principles in the sheep sector?  Specifically, I am thinking of scrapie-free as being part and parcel of the conditions, and perhaps even EID tagging, although maybe not everyone would agree.  It is possibly something that could be used as a mechanism to get farmers to buy into it.<\/p> <p>  I suppose the Minister will not be surprised when I say my second point is about disease control.  The rates of tuberculosis, TB, are falling, but not where I come from.  On this issue, I must raise a flag.  There is a particular problem to do with the deer population, not specific to but very much to the fore in Wicklow's case, and it will spread.  While we have had cross-departmental meetings, when I mentioned to an official that perhaps the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would take a lead the official stated the Department did not have the resources.  There is a saving of &euro;6 million and the amount needed to put up a robust plan to deal with this problem in Wicklow is a mere fraction of that.

This is a fund we want to spend on the beef sector because it was committed it.  I have said that we would look at it.  First, there will be a mid-term review of the genomics scheme.  Deputy Deering raised this point and we are going to review it.  If aspects are not working then we will change them, but we will have to get permission from the Commission to do that because this is a co-funded scheme.<\/p><p>Most farmers are quite comfortable with the beef genomics scheme now that they understand what is being asked of them.<\/p><p> Once the payments start flowing I believe this will be a very strongly supported scheme.  If anything, the requests I receive now are from people who want to join the scheme.  They had previously decided not to join but now would like to do so.  There is no easy way for them to join because the scheme involves a six-year commitment which means there are consequences if somebody joins late.

In many ways, the sheep sector benefits the most from the new CAP scheme in terms of the redistribution of the single farm payment and so on.  We sought to protect the former sheep grassland scheme and to incorporate it into people's individual payments.  If we were to do a new sheep scheme and have it a little bit like the beef genomics scheme then we would have to go back to the Commission to amend the rural development programme, which would take some time.  We would also have to find money to provide the scheme.  Effectively, we would have to take money from some scheme that has already been approved.  This is not an easy process but I am not saying that I am totally closed to the idea.<\/p><p> If the scheme becomes a big priority, and if we were to look at it, then there is a whole series of things that need to happen before we could proceed in terms of getting agreement on a formal amendment of the rural development programme and finding the money by taking it from another scheme which, again, is not a straightforward process, to put it mildly.  I take the point and the issue has been raised.  I am not closed to the idea, I am simply saying that there is a process involved and if we want to prioritise the issue then it will take some time.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deering asked about a dairy fund for the future.  Price volatility in dairy is going to be-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#N00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I want to know about price volatility in all sectors and not just the dairy sector.

There are things that farmers can do and we have used the tax system to improve things.  We have changed three-year income averaging to five-year income averaging so that people can average out their profits over five years rather than three years.  As a volatility management measure, we actively encourage dairy co-ops to look at medium-term fixed price models.  Glanbia and Kerry are already doing so and Dairygold is on the verge of putting a product together for farmers.  I am sure other organisations are looking at the issue.<\/p> <p>  Many farmers have tied themselves to two or three years of fixed prices for milk at 32 cent or 33 cent per litre base price.  They now look like they are in a pretty good position versus everybody else.  When they fixed their milk price many other farmers claimed they were mad because at the time the base price was 38 cent per litre.  Price volatility is the reason we have the dairy and beef forums.  We want to look at models whereby we can help to hedge against or ensure against the downside of price volatility.  Nobody wants not to benefit from the upside of prices either.  We want to take the highs and lows to ensure more consistent pricing.<\/p> <p>  There is no reason we cannot look at similar models for beef production.  I have more confidence in a successfully introduced producer organisation model for beef.  It means beef farmers have a professional negotiator who negotiates on behalf of multiple beef farmers using an economy of scale to negotiate with factories.  I would like see that model rolled out and that is what we are trying to bring to the beef forum.  At the moment, beef farmers are simply price takers when they turn up at a factory and that is not where they should be.<\/p> <p>  There are many things happening to deal with price volatility.<\/p><p>We could have looked at using rural development funds to put a crop insurance model in place.  Such a model would get farmers to put lump sums of money into an insurance model which we would top up.  The problem with such an initiative is that often some farmers will pay for other farmers who may have a price difficulty.  That model has not been very successful across the European Union so not very many countries are going for it, as far as I can see.  I am very interested in coming back here to have a debate on our response to price volatility across the sectors because it is an interesting policy area.<\/p><p> We are also looking at a proper and active futures market in Ireland for dairy product that co-ops can use.  If a small co-op can buy product on a futures market then it can offer its farmers guaranteed prices, if members know what I am saying.  Such an initiative is used in the US all of the time and we could do it much more effectively here.  We are looking at bringing a model for a futures market in Ireland to the dairy forum the next time it meets.<\/p><p> Teagasc has reduced its number of staff retirements from 50 to 31 which produced a saving of &euro;3.3 million in lump sums in 2015.  It is important to say that it has been agreed to assign Teagasc an extra 37 temporary staff to ensure that every farmer is accommodated in the context of the green certificate qualification many young farmers seek at the moment.  The initiative brings the overall allocation of temporary resources for the green certificate qualification to an extra 77 people in Teagasc.  We are conscious that the issue needs help and there will be more support where that came from.  Teagasc needs more staff not only in education but in terms of its consultancy work.  The freeze on recruitment across the public sector is being loosened.  Teagasc is an obvious example of an organisation that will benefit from that and spend a bit more.  <\/p><p> In terms of Deputy Penrose, I expected - as did a lot of farmers - that they would have to pay for a significant portion of the disallowance that was being applied to Ireland.  Irish farmers were never going to have to pay all of it but they expected to have to pay a decent chunk of it.  We now have agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we would clear it this year.

It is always dangerous to say that people have been vindicated.  However, the beef genomics scheme seems to be very popular and quite successful.  If it needs to be amended then we will do so but I think the scheme is working.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about TAMS approvals.  As many as 1,000 dairy farmers applied for TAMS II.  We simply cannot give all of those approvals out before the end of the year as there are many things happening in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of huge volumes of money being paid to farmers across multiple schemes ranging from basic payments, areas of natural constraint, ANCs, GLAS, AEOS, TAMS, beef genomics, island payments and so on.  We simply do not have the number of staff required to go on to farms and grant approval to 1,000 applicants.  We have got people to ring up the 1,000 farmers to find out which ones desperately need to get dairy facilities in place early.  For example, there are young farmers who are breeding heifers for milking who do not have any milking facilities.  They are new entrants so through TAMS they have to get their milking facilities in place quickly before calves are born and they will be prioritised.<\/p><p>We hope to be able to obtain approval for about 200 of the 1,000 before the end of the year and, obviously, the rest will be approved in January.  When I say to farmers that we have to prioritise, most of them accept it.  We will try to be as practical as we can in order to prioritise the cases that need to be prioritised the earliest.  <\/p><p> We are doing a lot about the hen harrier.  Essentially, we have designed an element of the GLAS plus scheme to facilitate hen harrier farming.  The commitment made to farmers who have land designated by the previous Government which let everybody down was that they would be paid &euro;370 per hectare.  About &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million was set aside for about 4,000 farmers with designated lands.  It was disastrous and farmers felt they had been treated terribly and in a dishonest way in an effort to have the designation of land agreed to.  We have now responded to solve that problem which was not of the Department's making, whereby a significant proportion of the farmers with designated land for the hen harrier under the GLAS scheme will receive &euro;370 per hectare up to 19 hectares.  Next year we will introduce an area based targeted scheme that will allow for extra payments to be made to farmers who have more than 19 hectares of land up to a ceiling which we have not yet set.  I do not want to put a figure on it, but the scheme will allow for a significant increase in payments to farmers with much restricted designated land.  We anticipate that we might be spending about &euro;23 million per year which is a lot of money to spend in the case of one bird.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#P00800","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Will there be retrospective payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#Q00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>We cannot make such payments because we were not in charge of the scheme until we designed the GLAS scheme to try to resolve the hen harrier issue.

They seem to be happy about this.  We are looking through the threat response plan to try to provide greater flexibility for them in terms of afforestation.  That is a subject of discussion between us and the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

It took a while to negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which needed to understand the reason it was important, but we have a full top-up payment to which dairy farmers can look forward to receiving.  It is not massive, but it will make a difference between now and the end of the year and I hope it will provide some insulation in dealing with the difficulties being faced on price.  We are budgeting to pay out a sum of &euro;24.8 million.  The total amount is &euro;27.4 million, minus &euro;1.6 million for young farmers and &euro;1 million for those involved in the pig sector.

There are about 4 million Syrian refugees living in refugee camps which is almost the population of Ireland.  The World Food Programme is the largest humanitarian organisation on the planet and is feeding most of these refugees.  I thought it was a very good way to spend money.  The money is not tied entirely to refugee camps, but we have given an indication that we would like it to be spent on refugees, where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#Q00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>To which camps does it go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#R00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>We will not itemise them.

We simply would not have this money if we were not spending it on the World Food Programme.  It is part of Ireland's overall development aid contribution.  In case farmers think we are taking it from the moneys for areas of natural constraint, ANC, or the beef genomics scheme, we are not.  The money for the World Food Programme is spent through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because we have a very good relationship with the organisation.  I have just been to Ghana.  It is the Department of food, as well as agriculture.  It is part of the Government's broader commitment to provide development aid and humanitarian assistance and is being paid through the Department and has more than doubled.  A sum of &euro;60 million for the World Food Programme over the next three years represents a significant commitment and if people want to know what it means, one can feed two refugees in Syria for $1 dollar a day.   Therefore, &euro;60 million will go a long way in feeding people who have nothing in terms of possessions or finance.<\/p> <p>  We are making phenomenal progress in dealing with TB.  It is a great story.  We have saved a large amount of money, but, more importantly, we are moving towards trying to eradicate it.  My personal ambition is to eradicate in Ireland by 2030, which is possible as a result of conversations we have had with veterinary officers and so on.<\/p><p>It is the first time ever that we are actively talking about eradicating TB entirely from Ireland.  That is a statement that will probably be quoted back to me in the future but that is what we would like to do.  We will keep the pressure on to try to eradicate TB.  We clearly need to have a more focused effort on doing that in places like Wicklow.  There has been a 40% reduction in the incidence of it since 2008 and a 7% reduction since 2014.  That is 1,000 fewer animals, so that is a great saving.  <\/p><p> On the brucellosis side, we are now brucellosis free on the island of Ireland.  They have done great work in Northern Ireland in eradicating brucellosis.  They were well behind us on that.  Until they were brucellosis free in Northern Ireland we could not make a statement that Ireland as an island is brucellosis free because of the movement of cattle across the Border.  My colleague in the North has done very well on that.  It has been a joint effort and there has been a great outcome.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question about the islands, my understanding is that we are budgeting for spending of &euro;2.5 million for the islands this year.  In terms of areas of natural constraint, ANCs, to be clear on this, the profile for ANCs that we set was for &euro;189 million to be spent by the end of November and we have spent &euro;189.5 million, so we are bang on with what we said we would do on ANCs.  If we have more room to spend money, I am very anxious to get money out to disadvantaged areas, particularly given the weather we are facing at the moment.  There is always stacking each year because payments carry over into January.  Sometimes that is a useful tool for staying within budget and sometimes we can try to prioritise to get more spend in one year, which is what we are trying to do this year in that we are trying to get extra money out to farmers that are in ANC or disadvantaged areas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#R00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Where is the &euro;115 million behind in terms of the profile if the spending profile for those areas is &euro;0.5 million over?

Comparing this year's spend to last year's spend, we would expect the Department to be well ahead because it has much more money to spend over 12 months.  I did not do up profile, the Minister did.

It is not an unreasonable question.  The profile, which is the best estimate of the timing of expenditure when drawn up in January, which is the start of the year, is difficult to forecast and actual expenditure, as we clearly see, may vary significantly during the year for various reasons, such as levels of payments under demand-led schemes, the pattern of drawdown of grants by State bodies, the level of disease incidences and payments of compensation.  The delay relative to profiled capital expenditure is attributable to a number of expenditure subheads, including the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the fishery harbour centres and the remediation of Haulbowline Island.  Significant expenditure is expected in each of these in December and where capital funding is not spent, provisions exist whereby a percentage of the allocation can be carried over to the following year but we are seeking to try to get it done this year, with the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure.<\/p> <p>  On current expenditure, significant payments under schemes, such as the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and areas of natural constraint, ANC, are planned for December.  We are slightly behind schedule but the Estimate we give in January varies during the year.  If the Deputy asked us for an Estimate in September, we would probably have given a more accurate Estimate, I suspect, but the Department's focus now is to make the expenditure this month before the end of the year to make sure that we are consistent with the Estimate that we are giving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#T00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Will the Minister ask his officials to provide me, as he did for the mid-year, with a detailed outturn and profile to the end of November so that I can understand where the &euro;87 million on the current side and the &euro;28 million on the capital side are?

The Government also agreed to a proposal by the Minister for Finance that the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance would work together on any necessary additional amendments to the Bill relating to a role for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  <\/p><p>I informed the House it was intended to move Committee Stage amendments to provide for a new section setting out in law the detailed criteria under which the Minister shall calculate premiums, primarily that they should not exceed the level needed to defray or partially defray the costs of the scheme, and clarifications to ensure finance providers meet applicable law in respect of the conduct of their business under the legislation.  <\/p><p>These technical amendments were circulated last week and cover premium setting and clarification of the need for finance providers to meet all appropriate legal requirements before being eligible to benefit from the guarantees.  These changes will impact on sections 5 and 8 dealing with the power of the Minister to make schemes in consultation with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and his powers to set different premia for different schemes.<\/p><p>In addition I indicated there would be important changes in a new and separate part of the Bill under the following headings.  One, provision for State promotion of financial institutions that will in future work with the Minister through this legislation to enhance provision of credit to SMEs and two, a role for the Minister to be able to give counter guarantees intended to enable promotion of financial institutions to unlock matching guarantee facilities from EU sources and share the risk across banks; and the promotion of finance providers, for example, the SBCI, the Minister and a number of potential EU sources.  In respect of the latter, it is envisaged this counter guarantee would operate in conjunction with the leveraging of related EU financial instruments in this area, such as the European Programme for Competitiveness of SMEs, COSME, Horizon 2020 funding earmarked for SMEs and the European Fund for Strategic Investment, EFSI, administered by the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund - the Juncker plan.  In this way Ireland will be able to optimise its return from major EU initiatives.  <\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Finance completed work with the Office of the Attorney General on these points and the appropriate revisions were circulated to the House last week.  The amendments are, by and large, contained in a new Part 3 of the Bill, sections 9 to 15, inclusive.  Arising from the additional part, there are some technical amendments to the earlier parts of the Bill which I will flag as we proceed.<\/p><p>During the debate on Second Stage I stressed that the overarching economic need to ensure Irish firms had the full suite of financial and other supports available to enable them to compete internationally was paramount.  The Bill and the additional revisions to it will ensure that in the area of credit guarantees, Ireland will have a framework that will be more than just fit for purpose, covering an extensive suite of products, it will ensure we will have the ability to make best use of the EU funding made available to member states by means of risk-sharing financial instruments.  The Bill and the Committee Stage amendments I have outlined, particularly those that will facilitate the leveraging of EU funding, will significantly benefit firms, employees, SMEs and the economy at large.<\/p><p> I flag to the committee my intention to submit three further amendments on Report Stage which will impact on employment rights, the Workplace Relations Act and the Companies Act.  They are purely technical in nature and will enable the recently enacted legislation to be fully effective.  <\/p><p> As I said, the Bill and the Committee Stage amendments contain major changes to the 2012 Act.  One of the proposals is that the original section 1, with its brief definition of the principal Act, be deleted.  A Part 1 break is being inserted and the new section 1 will deal with citations and the like, mirroring section 10 of the 2012 Act.  The new section 2 will contain the necessary definitions of \"Minister\" and \"Principal Act\" which currently are included with other definitions but which are being moved because they apply to all parts of the Bill, with section 1 being deleted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#A00325","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote><b>2. <\/b>In page 3, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Definitions<\/b><b>2. <\/b>In this Act&mdash;<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Section 1 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to. \r\n\r\nSECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:&ldquo;(c) the finance provider is a crowd funder which operates as a credit facility and its liquidity is sourced from the general public and provides loans to businesses in a peer to peer arrangement.<br \/><br \/>(d) the finance provider is a credit union which operates in Ireland under Central Bank regulations.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Much of the debate on the credit guarantee scheme from its inception has been about the fact that the banking system is broken.  These are new products that have been designed to fill the gaps left by the banking system which is not working properly.  We have, to all intents and purposes, an oligopoly in the State and need to make sure we have other elements in the credit system that can function properly and add to the choices for consumers of credit.  The amendment deals with two unloved sectors of the credit ecosystem.  <\/p><p>It is welcome that the Minister of State has broadened the credit facilities that may be used in the future under the Bill.  However, on Second Stage I brought to his attention the necessity of using crowd funding as an opportunity for the State to funnel cash towards small businesses.  In Britain, for example, 10% of all crowd funding loans are backed by the State.  The sector is very small here and it is finding it hard to gain traction owing to the lack of backup from the State.  That is why it is necessary for the Government to include crowd funding as part of the credit guarantee process.  <\/p><p>The second area about which the amendment speaks is the credit union sector.  We dealt with a Private Member's Bill recently and representatives of the credit union movement appeared before the joint committee.  The credit unions stated they had &euro;13 billion in capital for which they needed a home.  They also referred to the fact that they were very well regulated and had come through the crash unscathed in comparison to the banking sector.  In that context, I call on the Minister of State to make sure these two key components which will provide opportunities in the future, in terms of credit, are included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00700","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendments proposed which will make this a far superior Bill to the one originally published.

The credit union movement is open for business and very keen to get involved in SME lending, in particular.  Unfortunately, however, it is being rebuffed at every opportunity in being allowed to exploit its asset base and encourage its membership which is locally based to support locally rooted SMEs.  The obstruction is in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but in the Department of Finance and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  This is an opportunity to rebrand the scheme.  The success of Microfinance Ireland since its reorganisation is a clear indication of the demand for small-scale SME lending.  The credit union movement and crowd funders are ideally suited to meet that demand.  Several crowd funders have made presentations to the joint committee.  What could be done through this channel is phenomenal, particularly for new enterprises and start-up companies which are still finding it very difficult to obtain funding.  Crowd funders are ideally situated and the inclusion of such funds would truly bring the Bill into the 21st century.  We should partner with crowd funders and the credit union movement in the provision of SME funding.  The credit union movement is very keen to get involved, but it is being rebuffed at every turn by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment, in extending the scope of the legislation and introducing additional flexibility, there will be scope to examine how a range of finance providers can operate under the Bill.

One of the key points put forward by the credit unions when they made presentations to the Oireachtas was their deep frustration in regard to the limiting of their ability to function within the SME sector.  It is difficult to understand that in a credit squeeze, the sector that least abused its position now feels it is being limited by the Government and Central Bank regulations with regard to trying to provide small loans to small businesses.<\/p><p> I would not mind so much if the Minister of State told me credit unions could be involved, but could only provide microfinance, like Microfinance Ireland for example which has a &euro;50,000 or &euro;75,000 ceiling on its ability to loan.  I would agree that this would be a prudent first step in their foray into this space.  In representing these sectors, SMEs and entrepreneurs in society, we as Opposition Deputies should at least commit to ensuring that they will be included in this scheme in the future.  Otherwise, we are just involved in creating loose legislation that does not address the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B01400","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>We in the Department and I, as a constituency Deputy, are in constant contact with the credit union sector, as is the Department of Finance, in regard to the role of credit unions and how that will evolve in the context of the SME sector.

As far as I understand, there has been no significant detail from the credit unions regarding how they intend to operate in that sector in the future.  The Government and the Oireachtas should be always mindful of the role credit unions and other alternative financiers and finance organisations can play in supporting the SME sector.<\/p> <p>  Clearly there is a difference of opinion between us and the Deputy in regard to how we accommodate the role of the credit unions, crowd funders and others, but the definition of \"finance providers\" in this legislation is sufficiently wide to include crowd funders and credit unions.

Section 4 of the principal Act, entitled power of Minister to give guarantees, contained a number of important elements, including the spread of risk and an effective monetary cap of &euro;11.25 million.  That is being increased to take into account the counter guarantee scheme as well.

The Government agreed to increase the 75% and 10% figures to 80% and 13%, respectively.  The latter is in line with state aid requirements and as Deputies are aware, there are serious state aid issues relating to how these types of schemes are operated right across the European Union.

This will achieve that goal.  There is much potential to increase lending without a commensurate increase to the risk and exposure for the State.  That is why we must get the balance right.  We want to make as many resources available to the SME sector as possible but at the same time making sure that the taxpayer is not exposed.<\/p> <p>  The overall amount of additional lending that can take place will depend on a range of different factors, as well as the number and type of schemes that will be operated under this legislation, the Minister's participation and each counter guarantee scheme.

Similarly, with Microfinance Ireland there is an understanding of its work and what is available there, which is useful from an SME perspective.  This is a demand-led scheme so we cannot at this point measure how many SMEs want to become involved.  Nor can we measure precisely the type of demands on the scheme over the next period.

Section 5 of the principal Act is primarily about the schemes made under legislation to date, namely during 2012 and 2015.  The amendments to section 5 of the Bill are to ensure new schemes can adequately cover the expanded types of financial products to be covered.  There are also some amendments covering matters flagged on Second Stage, particularly subsection (d) which is a necessary cross reference to the correct part of the new section 8 on policies and principles on the matter of charging a premium to cover the Minister's costs.  I will return to this topic later.  I commend amendment No. 12 to the committee.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 19, section 8 of the principal Act relates to payment of premia to the Minister.  The substitution is designed to take account of the types of products and the need for flexibility in the rate referred to.  By this approach we have, in effect, already gone a long way towards accepting the principle of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendments and the revised section 8 meets his requirement which regards credit unions and crowd funding, while also ensuring appropriate scope for flexible application of the legislation.  I commend the revised section 8 to the committee.<\/p><p>I will now turn to amendment No. 26.  Under the current legislation on credit guarantees, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation receives a premium in respect of the guarantees issued.  This amendment provides that the charging structure for the counter guarantee schemes operates within the charging structures and principles contained in the Bill.  It will be designed to ensure the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will receive the same level of premium adjusted to reflect the level of risk to which the Minister is exposed in each counter guarantee scheme.  When determining the level of premium, the Minister must have regard to a number of factors as set out in the amendment.  These include the objectives of the scheme and the likely expense of running the scheme.  The manner in which the premium will be calculated must be clearly set out in each counter guarantee scheme.  The amendment provides that the premium for a counter guarantee can only be used towards defraying the cost of the scheme.  In this way the cost of the premium will be kept as low as possible for the SMEs accessing finance under such schemes.  I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#G01700","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I tabled amendment No. 20 because credit is too expensive in this State, be it for those in mortgage distress who are paying a premium over their counterparts throughout Europe or small businesses who are paying a premium over that being charged to European banks - and this is even outside the credit guarantee scheme.  Paying for credit at such an enormous rate is a competitive disadvantage for Irish SMEs.  The credit rate might have been acceptable at a time when the banks were actually in a loss making situation and needed to make profits but we have seen some massive profits come from the banks in recent times.

A case could be made, when looking at future schemes, to take an approach to a particular sector and design a specific scheme - or if there is an attractive opportunity to do that -  in order to address a structural problem in a targeted way for example.  The premium could be reduced or amended to assist that sector.  Flexibility is included to allow this to happen.  The 2% premium is still there but there is flexibility.  The 2% applies to the credit guarantee scheme and the counter guarantee scheme and absolutely goes towards defraying the costs of the credit guarantee scheme which applies to the enterprise.

In a mortgage situation for example, any family who pays 5.3% will know the difference on their monthly repayments to a family who pays 3.3%.

Flexibility is enshrined in the Bill to allow a response to those situations.  I hope colleagues can support this.  The figure of 2% is the understood rate at the moment and there is a cost involved in operating a scheme like this.  These are resources that would be flown to SMEs that would not otherwise find their way to SMEs, in the absence of a scheme like this.

We have accepted the vast bulk of the review.  We commissioned that review and understood that changes had to be made.  I accept that it has been frustrating for everybody that it has taken a long time to get to the point where we can make amendments to the legislation to allow for the scheme to operate to its fullest potential.  However, I am very confident that it will do so.<\/p> <p>  It is normal procedure for the operator of the scheme, Capita Asset Services, to provide quarterly reports and they are published on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is not proposed to legislate to allow that happen.  Rather, it is proposed that we continue with the current arrangements under the revised legislation.  Those arrangements cover the credit guarantee and the counter guarantee elements.  We do this already and it is important that such information is available to be assessed by anyone who wishes to determine the success, or otherwise, of the scheme.  I assure Deputies that where any scheme is not meeting its potential, we will make any changes necessary.  We were very upfront about the gaps, deficits and deficiencies in this particular scheme and that is why we worked to address them as quickly as possible.  We all have a responsibility to work with SMEs to provide the jobs that we all want to see and we all have a responsibility to ensure that our finance system is functioning.<\/p> <p>  More generally, material on rates of bank lending to SMEs is more broadly a matter for the Minister for Finance.  In that context, it would not be appropriate to include such a provision in this legislation.  The Deputy's amendment is not appropriate to this legislation on credit guarantees but we will be publishing information in the normal way.  That information will be available to the public to allow them to make an assessment of the scheme.  Where there are issues arising, they will be addressed.  I am optimistic and confident that the amended scheme and the approach we are now taking will herald a new dawn for SMEs.  We have done the same with Microfinance Ireland and the figures for that body are improving all of the time.  We changed the way the Microfinance Ireland scheme operates and made it more attractive and accessible to micro-enterprises who need to use it.  We are not averse to holding our hands up, admitting that something is not working, fixing it when necessary and working with our colleagues in the Oireachtas to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04400","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04500","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, line 5, after &ldquo;2012;&rdquo; to insert the following:&ldquo;to enable the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, pursuant to a counter guarantee scheme made by that Minister of the Government, to give counter guarantees to promotional financial institutions for guarantees given by the institutions to finance providers in respect of finance agreements entered into by the finance providers with qualifying enterprises; to place a yearly monetary limit on the potential liability of that Minister of the Government in respect of all credit guarantee schemes and counter guarantee schemes taken together;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04900","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1449581400,"counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#J00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 87, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <p>  The Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2015 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#J00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned sine die.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee on Education and Social Protection: Select Sub-Committee on Education and Skills","time":1449581400,"counter":443},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Conaghan, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan (Minister for Education and Skills), Deputy Charlie McConalogue, Deputy Brendan Ryan.

My Department provided background briefing material to the committee and, therefore, I propose to keep this opening statement brief.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate sought will increase my Department&rsquo;s overall net voted allocation from &euro;8.012 billion to &euro;8.187 billion.  The additional &euro;175 million sought comprises &euro;125 million for current expenditure and &euro;50 million for capital expenditure.  A sum of &euro;40 million in current funding is required to cover the cost of a projected 600 additional retirements across the education sector in 2015.  While 1,540 retirements were originally provided for, the number being forecast is in excess of 2,150 retirements.  The additional funding is required to meet both the lump sum element and the ongoing pension cost element of the additional retirees.  My Department has little control over this component of expenditure.  Estimating the number of retirements in recent years has been difficult, due in part to the extension of the grace periods with regard to the calculation of retirement salaries - subheads A8 and C10 refer.  A further &euro;78 million in current funding is required to cover additional costs associated with third level student supports in 2015, &euro;61 million of which is needed to alleviate financial pressures being experienced by higher education institutions, HEIs, by bringing forward to December 2015 payments in respect of the student contribution that were originally due to be paid to the HEIs in January 2016.  An additional &euro;17 million is required, in large part to meet upward demographic pressures not originally provided for - subhead C11 refers.<\/p> <p>   The &euro;50 million required in capital expenditure is needed to progress projects under the 2014 summer works scheme that were not progressed or finalised in that year.  Applications were submitted by schools in November 2013 for inclusion in the 2014 scheme.  A total of 787 schools were initially approved to undertake school improvements across five categories of projects - gas, electrical, mechanical, the upgrade of toilet facilities and roof improvements.  Schools whose applications were not reached in 2014 were advised that their applications would be reviewed in the event that funding became available.<\/p><p>In April last, a further 559 schools were approved to undertake works across the remaining four project categories - upgrading and replacement of windows, school specialist room refurbishment, school building improvements and external works such as closed circuit television and fencing.  The total value of these projects was &euro;108 million and &euro;50 million is needed to complete this work in 2015 - subhead D3 refers.<\/p><p> A further &euro;6 million is required to provide for the increase in demand in the number of students requiring access to special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools, including students in special classes and students enrolling in special schools.  Government approval for an additional 610 SNAs was granted in July 2015.  This builds on the increases of 365 additional SNA posts provided for in last year&rsquo;s budget and the 390 additional SNA posts announced in December 2013.  The July 2015 decision increased SNA numbers from 11,330 to 11,940, and represents an increase of 11.7% in SNA posts available for allocation to schools since the Government came to office - subhead A6 refers.<\/p><p> A total of &euro;12 million is required to cover an estimated shortfall in appropriations-in-aid receipts, due to an overestimation of the level of these receipts to be brought to account in 2015.  These receipts mainly cover superannuation contributions, pension-related deduction receipts and European Social Fund receipts.  The receipts are effectively offset against the Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure figure to produce the figure for net expenditure.  The 2015 Revised Estimates allocation provided for receipts of &euro;573 million, but this will reduce to &euro;561 million in the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> All these additional expenditure requirements amount to &euro;186 million.  However, my Department has also identified offsetting net savings of &euro;11 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  These savings arise on subhead B5, covering grants to SOLAS in respect of further education and training activities.  The net saving of &euro;11 million comprises savings of &euro;14 million.  Based on expenditure returns received from the education and training boards, ETBs, there is an estimated accumulated surplus of &euro;14 million in the Exchequer funding from SOLAS to the boards in respect of further education grants.  SOLAS has agreed with the ETBs to recoup these surpluses by reducing the final tranche of payments to be made to them before the end of the current financial year.  The saving of &euro;14 million in the ETBs will be offset by additional expenditure of &euro;3 million, which will be required to cover the cost of the 75% Christmas bonus announced by the Minister for Social Protection in budget 2016.

However, there is a band within which the Minister can project that demand will be similar to the previous year plus a bit extra.  For those who are moving from junior to high infants, if they had an SNA in junior infants there is every likelihood they will carry it on to senior infants, and likewise through all the classes.  For those already in the school system, projecting the SNA demand for next year is a manageable job.  That confines it to those who are entering the system for the first time.

It will even off at primary level around 2019 or 2020 but will not do so at third level until we are way into the late 2020s or further on.

The total additional funding being sought for 2015 is &euro;665 million.  However, this figure is offset by the receipt of an additional &euro;65 million in respect of the UK-Ireland bilateral health care reimbursement agreement, leaving a net requirement of &euro;600 million, as indicated on budget day.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health is one of many Departments seeking a Supplementary Estimate this year.  While the amount sought is significant, it is worth noting that it represents less than 5% of overall health expenditure.  In percentage terms, the Department of Health does not have the largest Supplementary Estimate this year, but the Supplementary Estimate does recognise the particular challenges to be balanced in the health sector and the priority the Government attaches to addressing unmet needs.<\/p> <p>  Rising employment levels and an improving economy have made extra spending on the health service and in other priority areas of public expenditure possible, while still comfortably achieving our deficit and debt reduction targets.  We need to keep the recovery going and the economy strong in order that in the years to come we can hire more nurses, therapists and medical specialists and provide more services and new infrastructure.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. <\/p> <p>  There are significant drivers of demand and costs within health services which are a source of pressure on health budgets.  We face a growing and ageing population, with a considerable burden of chronic illness.  New expensive technologies are developed and approved every year.  There will always be more that we would like to do in the health service than we can afford, but thankfully, because of our very strong economic recovery, we can afford to do more now than we could during the economic crisis.  <\/p> <p>  It is welcome that this year's economic performance has provided us with scope to significantly increase budgets and provide for additional acute hospital capacity, long-stay and home support for older people, new drugs and appliances, additional discretionary medical cards and access to universal GP services for the very young and the very old for the first time.  In each of these service areas the funding sought will allow additional people in need of health and social care to benefit.  There is also provision in the Supplementary Estimate for unavoidable costs in 2015 outside these service areas.  It is preferable, where there is room to do so, that these be addressed without the need for reductions in service areas.  It is also welcome that, in general, where responses and service improvements have been approved and implemented in 2015, the funding is in place for their continuation into 2016.  This will provide an enhanced basis on which to address the health needs of the population next year.  <\/p> <p>  I will now set out the items making up the Supplementary Estimate.  During the course of 2015 I took the initiative to discuss with Government colleagues the need to anticipate and deal with emerging problems in a number of critical areas of the health service.  In particular, specific target initiatives were approved to reduce delayed discharges in acute hospitals, waiting lists and emergency department overcrowding.  We all know that the health service is constrained in its capacity to respond to growing demands, particularly for acute hospital services.  While we cannot introduce all the capacity required overnight, we worked with hospitals and community services to address responses that could be introduced relatively quickly.  <\/p> <p>  The problems in emergency departments are the manifestation of wider operational and capacity weaknesses.  The emergency department task force was convened last December and came up with a set of recommendations to reduce emergency department overcrowding.  I acted to support their implementation and secured an additional &euro;74 million to do so.  This funding came on top of measures already taken in budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provided alternatives to and relieve pressure on acute hospitals.  This funding has allowed us to reduce the waiting time for the fair deal nursing home support scheme from 15 weeks to four.  This cost approximately &euro;44 million and an additional &euro;35 million will be provided next year to keep the waiting time at two to four weeks.  It has also allowed us to open another 150 community beds, including at Mount Carmel Community Hospital, formerly a private hospital, and at Moorehall Lodge in Drogheda under a public private partnership arrangement.  These and other measures have, in turn, reduced the number of delayed discharges in hospitals from 850 to 558 as of 1 December.  This means that almost 300 acute beds have been freed up and are available every day to treat acutely ill patients.<\/p> <p>  We have also used the funding to keep patients out of hospital altogether or allow them to return home earlier through community intervention teams.  These are nurse-led teams of health professionals who provide a rapid and integrated response in the community or home for patients with an acute episode of an illness who require enhanced services for a defined, short period of time.  The community intervention teams provide a range of services, including administration of intravenous antibiotics at home, wound care and dressings and enhanced nurse monitoring following fractures, falls or surgery.  Last month an infusion service commenced in north Dublin.  This community based service provided by the community intervention team is linked with Dublin's northside hospitals.<\/p><p>There are currently ten community intervention teams in operation across the country and it is expected that a new team will commence operations in Waterford shortly, under CareLock.  To date this year, more than 16,500 patients have received a community intervention team service.  On average, this equates to a saving of between five and ten hospital bed days per patient and represents a significant saving on hospital resources.  It is better for patients and avoids unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitals stays.  We need to do a lot more of this in the years to come.<\/p><p> At the start of the year I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June 2015 and 15 months by year end.  Additional funding of &euro;51 million has been provided to ensure that these maximum waiting times are achieved.  The funding provided is intended to fully utilise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time.<\/p><p> The latest NTPF figures, published yesterday, continue to show improvements in waiting times with significant reduction in those waiting longest now clearly evident.  For November, reductions were achieved in the total inpatient day case waiting list, and in the numbers of patients waiting longer than 15 months and waiting longer than 18 months.  Similarly, there are reductions in the total number of people waiting for outpatient appointments, which has now fallen below 386,000 for the first time this year.  As Deputies will be aware those figures include anybody who is waiting any amount of time, even if only a few weeks.  Through facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours or by outsourcing where capacity is limited, the end of November sees a reduction of more than 11,000 in the overall outpatient waiting lists and of more than 10,000 in the number of people waiting more than 15 months for appointments.  It is encouraging to see that the number of people waiting more than 18 months has also decreased by 4,000.  The reductions being achieved are very welcome and I want to ensure these very positive trends are sustained and continue.  Further additional funding of &euro;18 million was provided in July for a winter initiative, which includes the provision of approximately 300 additional hospital beds across the country in November and December.<\/p><p> The situation in emergency departments is extremely challenging and I recognise the difficulties experienced by patients and the frustration of staff.  However, we are seeing some improvement as the measures taken and under way make a difference.  These measures are fully in line with the recommendations of the emergency department task force and are now generating results.  The special delivery unit figures show an 8% drop in the number of patients on trolleys in November 2015 compared to November 2014.  While INMO figures for the month of November show a 3% rise, it is significant that the INMO's own figures show an 8% drop in the second half of November.  Today, for example, the special delivery unit recorded a peak of 325 people of trolleys, 135 for more than nine hours.  That is a 20% drop on this day last year, when the number was 404.  Today's figures for the Irish Nurses Midwives Organisation, taking both trolley watch and ward watch together, put the number at 411, down 15% on this time last year when the number was 461.  It is nothing to celebrate but it shows we are moving in the right direction for the first time in a long time.<\/p><p> Further beds are due to open this month.  We are headed in the right direction and must persist with the considerable efforts under way right across our health service.  The November numbers, or today's numbers, whichever are used, are a big change from August when overcrowding was 40% worse than August 2014 and it is clear that things are not as bad as was the situation early in the new year when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys.  These were all real actions taken on my directions, with resources I secured, with the assistance of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  These actions are starting to show some results.  These are actions and solutions, not commentary, criticism and analysis which is all we get from the Opposition. The HSE director general and his team are working closely with the worst affected hospitals and there will be a continuing focus on achieving further improvements throughout the winter and into next year.  There are expenditure overruns in acute hospitals, social care services and the PCRS and the factors are different in each case.<\/p><p> Acute hospitals are projected to be &euro;149 million in deficit by the end of the year.  The deficit is predominantly caused by non-pay cost pressures, with non-pay costs projected to grow by 5.5% in 2015 compared to 2014.  All hospitals internationally are seeking to manage such costs which are associated with the increased age and complexity of patients being treated.  I notice that many chest hospitals this year are &euro;2 billion over budget.  Additional payroll costs have been incurred including through the recruitment of some 2,300 additional acute hospital staff, of which significant numbers are front-line doctors and nurses.  The impact of risk-related reports and difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical and nursing staff has put strong upward pressure on pay costs in some hospitals.  Having a stable, well trained workforce in place is essential for the performance of hospitals in terms of access, quality and cost.  With the removal of the recruitment moratorium this year progress was made by a number of hospitals in this area but others have more work to do.  There has been underachievement in certain cost reduction initiatives.  That being said, it is projected that &euro;25 million in savings will be made on agency expenditure compared to 2014 levels, which is a significant saving.  However, this is less than the target for the year and there will be a continuing focus on this area in 2016, particularly for those hospitals that did not make as much progress as expected.  We see considerable variation from one hospital group to the next in terms of how they managed their budgets this year.<\/p><p> The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, has a projected deficit of some &euro;151 million.  This comprises a deficit of &euro;136 million on schemes administered centrally and a deficit of &euro;15 million on locally administered schemes, including for the provision of aids and appliances, such as crutches and wheelchairs.  The PCRS overspend is driven predominantly by increased expenditure on the long-term illness, LTI, and the GMS schemes, including high-tech medicines.  The increased burden of chronic illness, including diabetes, is seeing the costs of the LTI scheme grow significantly.<\/p><p> The introduction and increased prescribing of new and innovative but highly expensive medicines is increasing the cost of the high-tech medicines scheme.  Earlier this year, agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a package of measures, including terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children under six years and the provision of GP care without fees to seniors aged 70 years and over.  These represent the first phase in the delivery of universal health care.  We intend to move on to children aged six to 12 years in the next phase.  The introduction of universal GP services for the very young and the old has been highly successful.  As of 1 December some 2,242 GPs or 93% of all GMS contract holders have signed under-six contracts.  More than 214,000 children have been signed up for the new service.<\/p><p> The new enhanced service involves age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments are being carried out once when a child is aged two and again at age five.  This is important in identifying issues such as childhood obesity early on.  The contract also covers an agreed cycle of care for children under six years diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs are carrying out an annual review of each child.  As of 1 December, 18,700 children have been registered for the new service under the Asthma Cycle of Care by their GPs.  With regard to the universal GP service for seniors aged 70 or over, more than 49,000 people have already signed up for the service.<\/p><p> The HSE, Department and the IMO have commenced talks on a new comprehensive GP contract.  A priority of these discussions will be further enhancement of chronic disease management for patients.  As a first step in this process, agreement was reached on the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care for adult patients with type 2 diabetes who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  The cycle of care aims to augment the service available to diabetic patients prior to the introduction of a comprehensive structured chronic disease programme.  The cycle of care commenced on 1 December and to date more than 59,000 patients have been registered for the new service by their GPs. <\/p><p> On the increased costs of operating the PCRS, at the end of October there were 95,887 people covered by a discretionary medical card - the most recent figures are more than 100,000 - an increase of 23,000 since October 2014.  This reflects the significant changes made to the rules and guidelines for discretionary medical cards more than a year ago.<\/p><p> Social care services give rise to a net requirement of &euro;53 million additional funding.  The main issue within social care relates to disability services with a deficit of &euro;48 million.  Significant staffing and once-off minor capital pressures have arisen in response to the enhanced regulatory focus by HIQA on disability residential services.  This enhanced focus, with external inspection and publication of reports, is a very good thing and is in line with the legislation adopted by this House.  The problems being identified by HIQA in disability services and in care for older people cannot be new, they must have been going on for decades.  The difference is we are now doing something about it.<\/p><p>It is important that these improvements are planned and undertaken in a cost-effective manner and in line with the community-based model of care.  This will be the focus of the use of significant additional ongoing funds provided to these services in 2016.  The Supplementary Estimate also provides for pay cost pressures in respect of overnight residential staff in the disability sector.<\/p><p> Pension costs including pension lump sums require an additional &euro;52 million.  The scale and number of retirements in any financial period is difficult to predict with certainty and, in line with some other Departments with large numbers of staff, additional funding is required in 2015 to meet the pension entitlements of those retiring.  In the main, these are front-line and clinical staff.<\/p><p> Payments are made by the HSE to the State Claims Agency for clinical indemnity, public liability and other awards and settlements.  An additional requirement of &euro;93 million is estimated for 2015.  It is difficult to predict the exact expenditure in any one year as this is dependent on the number and severity of claims, particularly the number of high cost catastrophic birth injury claims.  Another critical variable in projecting the cost is the uncertainty regarding whether these high value claims will be awarded lump sum payments by the courts, or whether they will be awarded a deferred periodic payment award pending the introduction of periodic payment orders on a statutory basis.  I expect legislation to be enacted early next year to provide a statutory basis for periodic payment orders, whereby a court may decide that catastrophically injured people can receive the cost of future care in the form of annual payments instead of a lump sum award.  If this legislation is enacted and works we may have an underspend in State claims next year, but we are not projecting for that.<\/p><p> The Government approved the independent symphysiotomy payment scheme and the scheme commenced in November 2014.  It provides awards to women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.  It was estimated that approximately 350 women would be eligible to apply.  In the event, 578 applications have been accepted by the scheme.  There are approximately 140 applications still to be assessed.  The scheme will conclude as soon as possible in 2016.<\/p><p> In 2012 the Medical Defence Union made a settlement with the State in respect of outstanding past liabilities relating to indemnity cover for medical consultants.  Work is under way to delegate responsibility for managing these claims to the State Claims Agency.  Pending completion of this work, payment of these claims must be made by my Department.  It is estimated that &euro;16 million of the Supplementary Estimate requirement will be sufficient to address these areas.<\/p><p> As Deputies may be aware, &euro;131 million of once-off cash receipts from health insurers were built into the 2015 budgetary arithmetic.  The HSE and VHI have now agreed terms which commit the HSE and VHI to work towards finalising a claims and payment arrangement and allows for an initial payment of more than &euro;100 million before the end of 2015.  This represents a substantial portion of outstanding private patient charges.  I welcome the progress made in this area by the HSE, with the support of my Department and the VHI.  Discussions are continuing between the HSE and other health insurers and I hope that these can also conclude positively and with agreement.<\/p><p> While I acknowledge that the extra funding being requested through this Supplementary Estimate is substantial, I am convinced that it facilitates much needed improvements in our health services.  This additional funding, combined with the 2016 budget provision, will see us continue to use the fruits of economic growth to restore funding to our health service.  In doing so we are maintaining and adapting existing levels of services and introducing enhancements in some priority areas.  The above items, together with cash projections to year end, involve a gross requirement of &euro;665 million.  The total Supplementary Estimate request reduces to an Exchequer requirement of &euro;600 million following the receipt of an additional payment under the UK-Ireland Reimbursement Agreement.  In conclusion, I seek the committee's approval of the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 38.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#B00800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  We are in the invidious position of short timescales for advancement of information and looking at the principle of Supplementary Estimates in the no-change policy areas.  We accept there have to be Supplementary Estimates.  However, year in and year out we have notifications of a Supplementary Estimate, knowing well in advance that there has to be a requirement for a Supplementary Estimate simply because there was inadequate planning, forecasting and demographic proofing.  That all flows from the inability of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to actually assess what it needs for the year ahead, and put a figure on it.  The Department and the HSE is incapable of doing it and this has not changed in recent times, in fact it has become progressively worse.  The figure of &euro;665 million, some of which I know has been because of changes in policies, is still a significant Supplementary Estimate considering that some of the policy decisions announced in 2014 that would have had an effect could have been factored into the 2015 figures also.  <\/p> <p>  We have not progressed in accountability either.  The Department of Health, the  Minister, senior officials and the HSE at senior management level are incapable of actually managing a budget.  It is a harsh thing to have to say but that is the simple fact of it.  It has been chaotic at times.  I understand the need for Ministers to flex muscles at times or to try to get a headline in the newspapers.  We have seen the previous Minister for Health trying to face down the cuts that were forced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, behind all that and when one strips it away there is a chaotic system - which is an oxymoron I suppose.  It is an issue which must be addressed because, fundamentally, if we are serious about delivering health care and services for people under the obligation of the State to provide public health services, there needs to be a foundation and a base upon which the year ahead can be planned.<\/p> <p>  The question must be asked whether the Minister holds back on always having a Supplementary Estimate because he knows full well the HSE is incapable of managing its budget itself.  If that is the case it is a damning indictment of the HSE.  Does the HSE always know there will be pressure on at the end of the year and that a Supplementary Estimate will come in anyway so there is no real inclination or obligation to make an effort to maintain the services within budget? It is probably a little bit of all of the above.  When one does not have certainty, security or a defined plan to implement health services then one gets panicked situations at the end of the year.  It happens time in and time out in the provision of health care.  With the Supplementary Estimate some procedures can be ramped up while other services are cut in order to try staying within budget.  It all seems to be chaotic.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talks about the potential privatisation of hospital trusts in the years ahead, or at least farming out the management of hospital trusts or groups to private companies.  Is the Minister concerned about the consistent, major overspend in our acute hospitals as currently constituted?  Is there an incentive for acute hospitals to overspend on a continuous basis knowing that when the trolleys are out as far as the car park, the ambulances are backed up and patients are unable to discharge, the political pressure comes on and all of a sudden extra money is allocated at the end of the year under a Supplementary Estimate?  Old habits seem to not have gone away on the Minister's watch.  Perhaps he could elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made announcements on increases such as the &euro;74 million for emergency department overcrowding and late discharges and &euro;25 million for the fair deal scheme.  That was indicated to him as far back as July 2014 when, on taking up his position, the Minister was briefed that delayed discharges were going to have a major impact on health care in terms of freeing up additional beds, moving patients from emergency departments into the hospital proper and moving people out of hospitals into step-down facilities in the community, nursing homes and home care packages.<\/p><p>It seemed there was a very long and lethargic effort to address that obvious challenge facing the health services in general.  I acknowledge matters are moving along much better in the accessing of nursing home care.  Clearly, much work needs to be done on the community care area, home package supports and so on.<\/p><p> With regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, I note the Minister stated that, \"Funding of &euro;51 million was provided to ensure that these massive waiting times would be achieved .... across the public voluntary hospitals ... [and] outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available.\"  He abolished the National Treatment Purchase Fund and set up a special delivery unit but who procures the extra capacity?  Is it the National Treatment Purchase Fund and, if it is, why do we not say that?  Why are we pretending that the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been castrated and is now effectively unable to do what it was meant to do?  We should try to bring it to the fore again to deal with the capacity issues.  We all accept there are difficulties with capacity in the public health system.  That is the reason we have seen major increases until recently in the number of outpatient, inpatient, day-case and other elective procedures.  If there is a capacity issue in the public hospital system, admitting it would help and the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be reintroduced to provide and procure private capacity to deal with the backlogs.  I cannot understand why we seem to be pretending that we do not outsource when we are outsourcing, which effectively means purchasing from the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#D00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I disagree with Deputy Kelleher in lumping the HSE in with the Minister, the Department of Health and the Government on the issue of the assessment of need and the capacity to operate within budgets.  As I well recall it, the HSE sought substantially more than was afforded to it for funding for the service plan for 2015.  Its assessment was more in line with the reality of this year and the additional provision being provided under the Supplementary Estimate before us.  It was the Minister and the Government who failed to provide the required funding.  On the reference to HSE's incapacity to operate within budget, again I believe Deputy Kelleher is wrong about that.  I believe it has the capacity but with under-resourcing, underprovision and a fault line in regard to accurate forecasting of the potential presentation of footfall, it would have found itself in a very difficult, if not an impossible, situation over the course of this year and that manifested itself on a number of occasions.  The bottom line in regard to all of that is underprovision and insufficient resourcing with the result that it had neither the human resources nor the physical wherewithal to cope within reasonable timeframes.<\/p> <p>  I would make a number of points in response to the Minister's opening remarks.  The &euro;600 million he is seeking now is &euro;65 million less than has been adjudged required to bring us up to the end of this month.  Can he clarify for the record if the &euro;65 million additional payment in respect of the so-called UK-Ireland bilateral health care reimbursement agreement has been received?  It is important to note that he referenced in his remarks the difficulty there has been historically in having private health insurers provide payment for specific service provision and that he is now seeing a &euro;100 million initial payment.  Is that an upfront payment?  There was not necessarily a correlation but a joint difficulty of taking the money from the health insurer entities and in regard to the British arrangement.  Is this money promised or has it been received?  <\/p> <p>  When the Minister talks about addressing the areas of unmet need, he is again confirming the situation, to which that I have alluded, with respect to the HSE.  This is unmet need and it is unmet most certainly because of under-resourcing and undercapacity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a number of other brief points.  On the emphasis on reduced delayed discharges, reduced waiting lists and reducing emergency department overcrowding, these are the areas of critical concentration in dealing with the issues in the hear and now which I believe will continue to be the areas of critical concentration.  It is important that everything is done to address these matters as quickly as possible.  The Minister stated that he cannot introduce all the capacity required over night but that he has responses in train that could be introduced relatively quickly.  Will he elaborate on the specific set of measures he hopes will be in put place now and towards the end of this month to get us through this last period of 2015?  Has there been an uptake in terms of nurse recruitment?  Apart from the winter months initiative in regard to the additional 300 beds, are other bed capacities being created that would add to that much needed resource to deal with the numbers presenting, which is expected to continue to rise.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of points to be welcomed and it would be wrong of me not to do so.  We have seen a significant reduction in the delayed discharges from 850 to 558 as of the beginning of this month.  The delivery of that improvement will compliment the additional bed capacity but there is no reason to be complacent.  Delayed discharges are indicative of underprovision with respect to future care needs, either in terms of home care packages or residential long-term care provision.  It is important we recognise that this needs to be part of any package of measures to address this particular vexed difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister stated that at the start of the year, he put in place maximum permissible times for inpatient and day-case treatment and outpatient appointments but, in fact, what he actually did is not what he said he did.  He actually extended the maximum permissible waiting times in each of these areas up to 18 months.  That is something that needs to be revisited.  Eighteen months in that respect is unacceptable.  We heard voices on his side previously, either in this committee or in the D&aacute;il Chamber, which were hugely critical of much shorter waiting times across inpatient and outpatient need, including day-case treatment, and yet we have permissible waiting times now of up to 18 months and 15 months by the year end.  What is current position on that?<\/p> <p> The number of people waiting for outpatient appointments has fallen below 386,000.  We should reflect on that number for a moment - there is no reason for celebration in this matter.<\/p><p>We have a huge job of work to do and I emphasise \"we\" because it is critically important that these matters are addressed comprehensively across the board.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a brief comment on the nine hour wait on trolleys and the Minister's recent indication of a penalty on hospitals that exceed nine hours.  That is the wrong way to go about the matter.  It is not about penalising those who fail to realise a timeframe regarding trolley use for patients.  Those hospitals may well be the hospitals that need even more support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#E00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I propose to move on to the subheads of the Estimates and we will go through individual subheads on the Vote.

It is a scientific fact that in those cases cerebral palsy is not caused by negligence, it is because of something that happened in the womb.  That is essentially what this boils down to.  The no-fault way would be a better way to do this by saying: \"A child with cerebral palsy needs support. Whether it was a natural occurrence or medical negligence is not the point, let us just look after all these children.\"  This requires a total change of policy and a significant increase in costs because one would then be treating equally those who could prove medical negligence and those who cannot.  It would mean that in cases of cerebral palsy occurring for natural reasons - which is usually the cause - those children should get whatever supports they need anyway.

This is particularly important in rural areas and areas where there is a single-handed practice.  Some hospital groups where it is known that consultants will retire have started to make what are known as proleptic appointments.  This was already done to some extent.  It means that if it is known someone will retire in three, four or five years, the post may be given to a registrar, for example, who is heading off to America.  This proleptic appointment means the job is available should the registrar wish to return.  We could do much better on succession planning than has been done to date.

My apologies, I cannot say which subhead it comes under.  I must give the Deputy an Alice in Wonderland answer.  Once upon a time, when I was a senior house officer in St. James's Hospital, I used to get a pay cheque from what was known as the Western Area Heath Board, an entity that no longer existed at that time.  Similarly, the regions referred to here no longer exist.  We have moved away from regions to hospital groups, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted, and community health care organisations, CHOs.  A range of national services are also in place, including the national cancer control programme and the health and well-being programme, under which BreastCheck would fall.  As such, accounting continues be based on regions that no longer exist.<\/p><p>Beneath it, the health boards still exist on a financial basis.  While we have national services such as the National Ambulance Service, for payroll purposes the ancient health boards still exist.  A major financial reform is required in the health system to align how the accounts work with how the service is configured.  This is a big job that must be done over the coming years and it requires a big IT investment.<\/p><p> There is no logical basis for funding across regions.  It will happen for the hospitals with activity-based funding.  Generally, people in health are funded on a historical basis.  They receive the allocation they received the previous year, plus or minus an certain amount.  This is not the way to do it.  Hospitals will move to activity-based funding whereby they will be paid for the work they do and the procedures they carry out.  Similarly, for the community health organisations there will be an assessment of population need.  Beyond this are the national programmes.  The HSE Dublin north east region includes the Mater hospital, which could be providing cardiology and cardiothoracic services to the entire country.  It also includes Beaumont Hospital, which could provide neurosurgery for the entire country, other than Cork.<\/p><p> It will never be straightforward.  Although the old legacy regions no longer exist, they are still used for accountancy purposes, and it has not changed much.  Even after the HSE was established ten or 11 years ago, the health boards were never abolished.  It is Byzantine, and will take more than the months remaining to me as Minister to sort it out.  It is very hard to justify spending tens of millions of euro on new financial systems and be told one is wasting money on IT systems and accountants when one should be spending it on front-line services.

Services that are not compliant with HIQA standards could be forced by the HSE to continue to provide the service and advised to ignore the HIQA recommendations.

The private sector has had to bring its buildings up to standard more quickly than public institutions.  The private sector thinks that is unfair and I can understand where it is coming from.  While the private sector has had to meet the highest building standards quicker than the public sector, in the real world we would not have anywhere for the older people to go if we started closing all those old nursing homes and district hospitals around the country.  That was just not a viable option.  Perhaps there is an element of unfairness but the legislation acknowledges that HIQA must have regard to the HSE's resources.

Those talks will begin in the new year.  They will be led by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Procurement Service.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor also asked about the decision to extend the scheme of GP care without fees.  In the end, after a great deal of consideration and legal advice, we decided to extend it in the first instance to children under the age of six and people over the age of 70 because people in those groups are most likely to need to see a doctor.  We thought it was particularly important to make this provision in respect of children under the age of six, because children are most likely to need to see a doctor at that age.  Illnesses and issues like obesity can be picked up at a very early stage.  At the time of making this decision, those whose children were most unlikely to have medical cards or doctor visit cards were working parents.  I know that a small number of people in this category were very wealthy but many of them really had to think long and hard about the &euro;50 required to see a doctor.  If this is done on its own, it will all be for nothing.  It was only ever a first step.  This involved starting with the oldest and the youngest.  We want the next steps to include all children because it is my strong view - I know this is not shared by everyone or by every party - that children should not be means tested on the basis of their parents' incomes.  We do not do it for education.  We do not charge people for primary or secondary education because their parents earn more than &euro;50,000 or whatever.  We do not do it for the early childhood education year.  We do not means-test child benefit.  The only thing we means-test in Ireland, when it comes to children, is health care.  Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does this.  It is a total anomaly.  I do not think we should do it.  Ireland is an oddity in Europe in so far as it does this.  Health is an oddity in Ireland in so far as this is done in the health area.  I think it is really unfair because working parents who get up early in the morning to go out to work lose out yet again as a result of the means testing of their kids.  I do not think that is fair.  This is just the first step in the process of redressing all of that.  Notwithstanding the health care benefits of this approach, there is a social justice element to it too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#K00600","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Provision of &euro;10 million is made in the budget for 2016 for the roll-out of access to free GP care to those between the ages of six and 12.

The provisions and anticipated costs for the roll-out of free GP care in the coming year are outlined in the documentation we have been given.  This is really an issue of access to health care, which has been narrowly defined by the Minister as access to GPs.  Of course, there is means testing on a continual basis for medical cards.  Unless I am reading it wrong, children are getting GP visit cards, in effect.  That is why people have contrary views about how universal health care might be advanced.  Many people are saying that someone who receives domiciliary care allowance, for example, should get a medical card.  It would be straightforward.  If someone meets the terms of the means test for the domiciliary care allowance, why not give him or her a medical card?  In such circumstances, at least medical cards would be targeted at those who are most in need of them.  While it is fine to give GP cards to kids under the age of six, the reality is that means testing for medical cards is continuing.  I have yet to find a medical card that is not means tested.  That is the grave difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I am getting going on this.  While there have been improvements in facilitating medical cards on a discretionary basis, in many cases it is still like pulling teeth to a certain extent.  I know there has been a major increase of approximately 95,000 in the number of discretionary medical cards in the system.  That dramatic increase has resulted from a change in policy.  The policy that was reversed was denied for 18 months before this policy change took place.  I think we need to look at this entire area.  The Minister speaks about universal health care and everything that flows from it but I think the policy of rolling out free GP services to the whole nation at a time when people in any age cohort who are already in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are being asked to undergo a means test when applying for a medical card should be looked at very quickly.  It makes sense to look at it.  I am no expert in this area but I suggest that when the social welfare and health codes intermesh in places like this, one means test should be sufficient for the awarding of the medical card.  My view is that such an approach would cut out a great deal of red tape.  I think it is something the Minister should look at as a means of advancing universal health care, as opposed to universal access to a GP which is fundamentally not the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#K00800","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I reiterate that if the extension of these cards to those under the age of six and over the age of 70 is the only thing we do, it will not be worth doing.  It was never intended to be anything other than a first step.  One of the first steps towards universal health care in Ireland was taken in the late 1940s and 1950s, when efforts were made to introduce the mother and child scheme.  It is a pity is stopped there.  The same arguments were made at the time against the mother and child scheme, which was originally proposed by Dr. No&euml;l Browne and, in fairness, was actually brought in by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Dr. Browne did not manage to bring it in.  It was brought in by the subsequent Fianna F&aacute;il Government and it all stopped there.  It is a pity we did not do something like that every three or four years.<\/p><p>Had that been done, we would have universal health care by now.  What needs to be done as part of the roll-out of universal health care is not just the roll-out to six to 12 year olds and then twelve to 18 year olds; it is a new medicines reimbursement scheme.  The current scheme is Byzantine and unfair.  There is the long-term illness scheme, under which some people pay nothing, no matter how wealthy they are; a medical card scheme under which people, some of whom are extremely poor, pay up to &euro;25; and then there is the drugs payment scheme for everyone else, which is based on a monthly payment.  It is not a good system.  In a few weeks' time, Members will see proposals in my party's manifesto as to how we might resolve all of that, or at least come up with a fairer scheme.  That would be the medicines element of it.  The Deputy is right to say that the &euro;10 million is there because it is anticipated that we could bring in the next step - GP care without fees for children aged six to ten - starting in Q4.  However, we have always made it very clear that we would not impose this on the GPs ahead of an agreement on a new contract, so it will not be a standalone contract in the way the under-sixes contract was.  It would form part of the new contract that we hope to agree with the IMO, which I imagine will include things other than the roll-out to six to 12 year olds.  It will include supports for rural practice and urban deprived areas, chronic disease management and other measures.

All of those things.  That is one of the things being discussed now.  I would like to have that agreed as soon as possible and then be able to commit to its implementation in the programme for Government, but my concern is that we will not be able to agree the contract until after the new Government is formed, and then we have to go looking for the money for it.  That is not ideal, but that is where we are.<\/p> <p>  On children with a diagnosis of cancer, that decision was made by the director general on the advice of the clinical advisory group, which now advises on the guidelines for the discretionary medical cards.  That whole area is fraught.  Nobody has the right answers when it comes to the guidelines for discretionary medical cards, which is why we need to keep changing them and updating them.  The whole issue of using the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, as a proxy for medical card eligibility was considered by the clinical advisory group.  On the face of it, I thought it was a good idea.  Maybe it is still a good idea.  I would not rule out doing it, but the view I came to was that it was not a good proxy for eligibility for a medical card because many people who receive DCA have a disability, but that does not necessarily mean they have high medical needs or considerable medical costs.  One will come across people with disabilities who will say they are not looking for a medical card - that they would like to have one, but they would prefer more educational supports or more supports around employment.  That is the dilemma.  Members will know themselves.  They will know people who have a disability but do not have to see their doctors a great deal and are not on any medications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>They are not drawing the medical card then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":682,"content":"<p>The GP would still get the fee, even if they never attended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I would not rule it out, actually.

There are real concerns at a number of sites around the country that, as the Minister acknowledged in earlier commentary, because of the age profile of many of the buildings in use, which were not purpose-built for their current usage, significant works are required.  HIQA reports are valid and are reflective of the fact that these buildings are not of the standard required today and that they need to be significantly enhanced or replaced.<\/p> <p>  I was due to meet with representatives of St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon yesterday evening, although the floods, unfortunately, made that unachievable.  That is just one example of a community that has a huge dependence on such a facility.  It is dependent on it not only for the critical function of providing nursing home and long-term care needs for people within the community - some 85 people in that reduced-capacity building - but also a whole range of ancillary services provided there, extending from Sligo Regional Hospital, which are very important to the dependent catchment area.  What can the Minister tell us about a capital plan that will give some hope and comfort to people in that community, for example, which is not in my own constituency, that they are not facing further downgrading and contraction and can look forward to a replacement construction on the site of the existing facility or utilising the wider campus area to provide a much-needed new facility?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I am going back to the private nursing homes.

Again, really good work is done there, but they are finding it very hard to keep nurses.<\/p> <p>  Finally, two separate sets of four parents who have adult sons and daughters in the 40s and 50s have come to my constituency office recently.  These parents are getting older and they are very worried.  They are looking after their children, who have a disability, at the moment, but they are very worried about what will happen in the future.  These adults are able to live independently with a little support.  They are all on the housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the parents feel that, for example, they could come together and live independently in one home.  At the moment, the HSE in Bray is saying it has no money for this, but could we look at a policy in the future whereby accommodation for people with disabilities does not always have to be residential, in a home.  Some people can live independently, but they need supports from the HSE and the local authority.  Instead of giving four houses, in this case, they would be funding one house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01400","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Approximately &euro;330 million was spent between 2009 and 2014 on replacing and upgrading some of these community nursing units, district hospitals and so on.<\/p><p>The facility I am most familiar with in my constituency is St. Mary's Hospital in the park, which has now been replaced by a fabulous community nursing unit.  An additional &euro;200 million is to be spent in the coming years upgrading or replacing some of the existing facilities.  There is also a public private partnership bundle as well.<\/p><p> Priority will be given to those which are least HIQA compliant, if that makes any sense.  HIQA will have expressed views on all of these facilities.  Some are more in need of being replaced than others.  The intention is to keep all of them open as much as possible until they are replaced or refurbished, for all sorts of obvious reasons.<\/p><p> I do not have a timeframe on any of them at the moment.  Certainly a facility such as St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon has to be done.  Again, I would rather not put a date on it because I do not want to be held to something that I cannot be sure of, but certainly it would have to be fully done, built and occupied by 2021.  The question of how it will be done has not yet been determined.  My best guess is that it will be done as part of a PPP.  In that case a total rebuild is probably required.  The existing facility probably cannot be refurbished.  In other words, we would have to rebuild next to it in the way the new community nursing unit was developed beside St. Mary's Hospital in the park.  Similar designs will probably be built throughout the country.  They will probably be done as a bundle of community nursing units similar to the bundles of schools or primary care centres that Deputies will be familiar with.  It is difficult to put an exact timeframe on it.  We hope it will be done as soon as possible.  However, it has to go through planning, design and so on.  It is difficult to put a timeframe on these things.<\/p><p> Nursing recruitment is a real struggle.  Everyone is recruiting at the moment, not only nursing homes but private and public hospitals as well.  Everyone is looking for nurses.  The HSE is 750 nurses up on this time last year.  Some of this is accounted for by agency conversion but most of it is a result of new extra nurses.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is getting better at speeding up the applications.  Often there are problems with paperwork and so on.  A particularly encouraging development this year is the effort being made to retain the graduating class of this year.  I was in Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, where 16 of the 18 trainee nurses are staying.  The other two are going to Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":694,"content":"<p>They are very welcome in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I hope they went to Cork University Hospital and not the Bons Secours Hospital.

However, the general backdrop is an international shortage of nurses.  The reason Irish nurses are in Canada and the Middle East and the reason Filipino nurses are in Ireland is because there is an international shortage.  There is no surplus of nurses in the world.  We are all begging from each other.  Moreover, for a period during the recession we were not creating posts.  We lost many people during that period.  It will be difficult to get them back because many of them have settled elsewhere.  Anyway, we are doing well with the graduating classes.  I believe we need to make a particular effort to keep them in Ireland and give them career and educational opportunities to encourage them to stay.<\/p> <p>  Certain nurses like particular types work.  Older care is a particular type of work.  It is very different to theatre or ICU nursing.  The NMBI has tried to speed up the whole process around registering nurses from overseas.<\/p> <p>  Another point we touched on was the need to provide more community houses.  The policy is not to put people in institutions or homes anymore and to de-congregate.  The idea is to have many more people with disabilities and special needs in houses in normal housing estates with everyone else, perhaps with two or three people in each house.  We know this happens and there are many examples in our constituencies.<\/p> <p>  The demands and the needs are vast.  A sizeable number of people are still in institutional settings, for example, in &Aacute;ras Attracta and other settings.  We are keen to get them out into houses in the community.  Many people are at home too.  There may be adults in their 40s and 50s with parents in their 60s and 70s - Deputy Mitchell O'Connor referred to such cases.  These parents are concerned about what will happen.  We should be providing more of these houses than at present, frankly.  The money simply was not available during the recession years.  I know that in Dublin West the Daughters of Charity opened a new house almost every year up until 2008 and then did not open any for six or seven years because of the recession.  The result is that we have pent-up demand that needs to be relieved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is in discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, because this is partially a housing matter and partially a health matter.  They need to agree something.
