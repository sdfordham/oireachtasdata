This Supplementary Estimate will provide funding to address the exclusion by the EU Commission of &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven year period from 2008 to 2014.  It will provide for a transfer of savings from certain areas of the Vote to fund expenditure under the fisheries harbour scheme, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the world food programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment.  It will also provide an increase of &euro;39 million in the Department's permitted net expenditure to deal with a Commission decision, applying to all member states, to delay payment of some of their expected 2015 rural development receipts.<\/p> <p>  In mid-November the EU Commission adopted a decision to exclude a total of &euro;278 million from 18 member states.  The net Irish disallowance amounted to &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven year period 2008 to 2014, inclusive.  This consists of two elements; a &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 to 2012 and a &euro;3.6 million exclusion for 2013 and 2014.  It represents 0.57% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven year period.  The exclusions relate mainly to Commission findings that some aspects of Irish control systems are insufficiently robust in excluding ineligible land from payments to farmers and EU funded schemes.  Other significant exclusions in the EU Commission's decision include &euro;53 million for the Netherlands, &euro;51 million for Italy and &euro;37.9 million for the UK.<\/p> <p>  This decision is the outcome of a prolonged process which began with a proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million for Ireland for the five years 2008 to 2012, suggested by the Commission in May 2014.  At the outset the Department opposed the application of the proposed flat rate correction and sought a hearing with the EU conciliation body.  The conciliation body acknowledged the amount of work done by the Department in reviewing over 900,000 land parcels using the land parcel identification system to identify and exclude ineligible areas in order to calculate the risk to the fund.  The report of the conciliation body in early 2015 concluded that the Commission and the Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to a settlement.<\/p> <p>  During the year the Department undertook considerable additional work at the request of the Commission to give assurances to the calculated risk and it was subject to further verification and audit by Commission officials in May 2015.  The reduction of over 60% in the final correction clearly indicates the Commission's acceptance of the Irish approach.  It is important that this disallowance be considered in its proper context and in the manner in which other member states have performed in this respect.  Since 2004, statistics have been collated which place Ireland in the best performing quartile of EU member states in this regard.  A figure of 0.9% of total EU expenditure has been subject to disallowance in Ireland since 2004, a significantly lower figure than the EU average of 1.96%.  The Department already has approximately &euro;3 million set aside in the Vote as a contribution to this disallowance and that, along with the additional &euro;65 million sought here today, will be used to address the implementation of EU funding.<\/p><p> While my Department has collected some &euro;4 million in respect of overpayments but not penalties, following the review of land parcels, my clear preference at this stage is that the cost of the disallowance be borne by the State.  This would be in line with similar decisions taken by many other member states on disallowances applied to their EU funds.  There are a number of technical and accounting issues that arise which are secondary to the need to clear the disallowance, which is now a mature liability, being discussed.  I have asked my officials to examine the matters involved. <\/p><p> On additional payments relating to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme, the World Food Programme and the EU market volatility top-up payment, I am also seeking the committee's approval to use savings in the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure, while not changing the total allocation for the Vote.  The proposed transfers and expenditure involve relatively significant changes to the original 2015 Vote allocations and it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.  Specifically, I am seeking to transfer funding into existing subheads for the World Food Programme, areas of natural constraints and fishery harbours.  I also wish to establish a new subhead in the Vote for a top-up on the EU market volatility payment.  The &euro;35.74 million in current funds and &euro;3.5 million in capital funds required would be transferred from various subheads where, owing to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the beef data and genomics programme, the seafood development programme and across a food safety, animal health and welfare programme.  <\/p><p> The beef data and genomics programme is part of Ireland's rural development programme.  There are 27,000 farmers in the programme which aims, over a six year period, to develop through a rounded multi-trait breeding strategy a national beef herd characterised by higher genetic merit animals.  The aim is that this would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions per kilo of output but would also result in improved production efficiency.  For 2015, the first year of the programme, the allocation was &euro;52 million.  However, payments are expected to total &euro;35 million, yielding savings of &euro;17 million.  This is primarily because a significant percentage of the applicants will not have confirmed completion of their requirement to submit performance data for calves up to five months of age owing to the timing of calvings on their holdings.  Hence, they cannot be paid in the final 2015 payment run to December.  Payments, however, will issue early in 2016 to these applicants with late calvings as they confirm their compliance with the requirements for 2015 born calves.  In other words, farmers are receiving these payments, but it is bridging from December into January and from one year into the next.  It is not the case that farmers are losing anything.  They will be getting it a few weeks later because their calves were born a few weeks later.  I understand one of my colleagues will be present later to discuss the beef data scheme in some detail. <\/p><p> Some &euro;9 million was allocated in 2015 to meet current expenditure on the EMMF seafood development programme.  It is anticipated that savings will arise owing to delays in the adoption by the Commission of the operational programme which, in turn, has delayed the launch of the new schemes by the Department.  I am delighted to announce that our comprehensive &euro;241 million investment package for the seafood sector has been adopted in law by the Commission and that the programme can now be implemented in full.  This has just happened within the past two days.  My Department has been working for some time towards this with stakeholders and the State agencies that will deliver the programme.  I expect schemes to be rolled out from the beginning of 2016 to assist seafood enterprises to substantially grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in coastal communities.  The seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to the economy.  I am aiming to achieve &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020.  It is expected that expenditure of &euro;1.9 million will be achieved in 2015, allowing for a saving of &euro;7.1 million.<\/p><p> It is also anticipated that savings of just more than &euro;6 million will be achieved in the animal health and welfare area owing to a reduced incidence of disease.<\/p><p>This is a very positive story.  These savings are mostly in the TB and brucellosis eradication area, where progress at reducing the incidence of TB has been maintained and the positive brucellosis situation continues.  Expenditure on the control of horses scheme is also lower this year and there is a small reduction in the fallen animal scheme costs.  Again, this is connected to positive animal husbandry and a lower incidence of disease.  Almost &euro;4 million in savings is expected from Teagasc and Bord Bia.  These relate to savings on the 2015 pension allocation for these organisations, possibly as a result of the extension of the grace period for public sector retirements.  Other savings are in the early retirement scheme and rural development technical assistance.  Overall these current expenditure savings amount to just in or about &euro;35 million and these savings, with the committee's approval, will be transferred to fund a number of measures.<\/p><p> The World Food Programme, WFP, is a United Nations organisation responsible for the delivery of food assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. It partners with other United Nations agencies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, civil society and the private sector to enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food needs.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the lead Department in Ireland's engagement with the WFP.  In recent years, my Department has provided &euro;9.96 million in core multilateral funding to WFP.  This amount is included in the Department's voted allocation.<\/p><p> On 6 September, Ireland co-hosted with Italy an event at Expo15 in Milan to promote the work of the World Food Programme and encourage donors to optimise their support for WFP by providing unearmarked funds to allow the WFP maximise flexibility to provide rapid responses to crises such as the Syrian refugee crisis.  At the event, I made a commitment on behalf of Ireland to double its core annual multilateral contribution to WFP from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million for the next three years.  This commitment is a key commitment of the Government's enhanced and increased response to the ongoing refugee crisis associated with the conflict in Syria and represents a significant part of Ireland's contribution to the European Union's response to the refugee crisis.<\/p><p> In response to a significant price deterioration for primary producers in the dairy and pig sectors this year, the European Commission proposed a package of support measures worth &euro;500 million.  The Commissioner did a great job in that regard.  Dairy prices in Ireland have dropped by 21% in the past 12 months and dairy farm incomes are expected to be down by up to 50% in 2015 compared to last year.  This package of support measures was agreed by the Council of Ministers at its September meeting.  Some &euro;420 million of the funding is to fund direct aid for primary producers in the dairy and pig sectors.  This funding was divided among member states based on certain criteria and Ireland's allocation was &euro;13.7 million.<\/p><p> To reflect the fact that the package is intended to only partly cover the losses suffered by primary producers, the regulation allows for member states to supplement the allocation by up to 100%, which is, in Ireland's case, an additional &euro;13.7 million of national funding.  I am proposing to fund this national element with the savings on the 2015 Vote.  Given the severity of the income decline, this additional national allocation will help to alleviate the risk coming in the pivotal period immediately after a quota abolition.  This decline would undermine the potential contribution of the dairy sector to sustainable growth in output and employment in rural areas.<\/p><p> Deputies will be aware of the importance of the scheme of support for those farming in areas of natural constraints, heretofore referred to as the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I am seeking the committee's approval to increase the 2015 allocation to this scheme to cover payments to farmers which relate to previous years.  Payments under the ANC scheme start in late September but payments to some participants inevitably spill over into the next calendar year for various reasons.<\/p><p>It will inevitably spill over into the next calendar year for various reasons.  That happens with schemes and it is happening with the beef scheme now.  Accordingly the accumulated spillover from the 2013 and 2014 schemes into the 2015 financial year results in &euro;195 million provided in 2015 being inadequate to fund all of the liabilities.  The introduction in 2015 of the new islands category within the ANC under the RDP must also be accommodated.<\/p><p> On the capital expenditure side of the Vote, some savings will arise from the farm safety scheme, the final scheme to be launched in TAMS 1.  I introduced the scheme in response to a number of farm debts last year - far too many unfortunately.  While the scheme proved popular with approximately 4,500 approvals, expenditure has lagged behind as not all farmers approved had submitted claims by the scheme closing date in September.  I have provided again for the safety measures under the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme in the new TAMS 2, which was opened to applicants in recent months.<\/p><p> Some &euro;11.5 million was originally allocated to fisheries harbour centres in 2015.  However, additional funding of &euro;6.8 million has been required to complete the necessary capital works, &euro;5.1 million of which has been found within the fisheries subhead.  The additional &euro;3.5 million required will, with the committee's approval, come from the unspent TAMS fund.  The extra funding requirement is due in part to expenditure this year on some projects connected to storm damage that occurred in 2014: a delayed &euro;6.4 million expenditure on a major dredging project in Dunmore East, planned for 2014 but which must now be funded in 2015; the local authorities harbour development programme; and the local authorities storm damage programme.<\/p><p> As well as having economic and developmental benefits in remote coastal areas, much of the work undertaken on harbours has health and safety advantages for seafarers and others.  The Department's budgeted total appropriations-in-aid for 2015 come to &euro;469 million, the vast bulk of which represents claims in respect of rural development expenditure for 2014 and 2015.  It is now forecast that &euro;430 million will be accounted for as appropriations-in-aid, which would represent a shortfall of &euro;39 million in current receipts.  This shortfall is due to a decision by the European Commission in mid-November that due to a higher than expected expenditure on new programmes in all member states, there would be insufficient EU funds available to pay all rural development claims fully in 2015.  Obviously, that posed a problem for us because we had anticipated that money would come in.<\/p><p> It was announced that for member states' 2014 to 2020 rural development programme claims made in November 2015 a payment of one third would now be made in 2015, with the remaining two thirds to follow early in 2016.  The November claims receipt would have been received in December 2015 and is critical to allow the Department to balance its net expenditure in line with voted expenditure figures for the year.  The Commission decision creates a shortfall which this Supplementary Estimate will now address.<\/p><p> The Commission has assured member states that these receipts, which are not being paid in 2015, are protected and will be paid in 2016 from the EU 2016 budget.  Our 2016 Revised Estimates, which will be published this month, will show an increase in appropriations-in-aid, above that which was produced in the Estimates Volume, to reflect this.  Hence the issue is one of timing rather than amount to be recouped.<\/p><p> The amount being sought from the D&aacute;il is &euro;104 million and is essential for my Department to deal with the issues I have just outlined.  I earnestly recommend the committee to give its support.  I will obviously try to provide clarification or answer any questions members might have.  I am conscious that this is a much bigger Supplementary Estimate than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine would normally have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#E00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Presumably, the Department had a profile of calving patterns and knew how many cows would calve after 1 July.<\/p><p>The Minister has argued that the reason for the shortfall was late calving rather than farmers not inputting all the data.  The Department knows from calving patterns that a certain number of cattle calve after 1 July.  Based on its data, what is the ratio of calves born after 1 July compared to the number of calves born before 1 July?  How many animals or hectares - the use of hectares in the scheme is a fiction used for the European Union - did the Department expect the scheme to cover?  The figure of &euro;17 million appears to be a gross miscalculation by it, particularly if it is still claiming that the scheme will be fully subscribed.  My suspicion is that &euro;52 million will not be spent under the scheme in any calendar year.  Is the Minister sticking to the view that when the full year returns have been made, &euro;52 million will have been spent under the scheme or does he accept that there will be an underspend in the long term, unless it is reopened?  We need the truth on that issue.  <\/p><p> I note that provision is made for increased expenditure on the areas of natural constraints scheme.  Is the underspend on the scheme one of the reasons the Department is behind schedule in its payments to date?  If it expects to exceed the provision for the scheme by such a large amount - approximately &euro;20 million - how does it propose to shovel out so many payments to farmers in the remaining 19 days of the year, especially given its inability to make payments this year to farmers who have been roaring down the telephone every day looking for their money?  What is the actual expenditure under the areas of natural constraints scheme?<\/p><p> As the Minister correctly noted, many farmers will not receive their areas of natural constraints payment for 2015 this year.  Why is there such a discrepancy between the figures for previous years and the figure to be carried over into next year?  Does the Minister understand the point I am trying to make?  It does not appear logical that the Department needs a significant amount of additional money this year because one would expect the unspent amount at the end of any given year to be roughly equivalent to the additional amount spent in the early part of the year to meet payments not made in the previous year.  As such, one should not need to provide a lot of additional money for the scheme.<\/p><p> What is the estimated additional cost for the islands?

Many of these businesses provide jobs, but they do not get a look in.  I hope that, whatever the hue of the next Government, it will adopt the same positive attitude.<\/p> <p>  This is an important issue because if taxpayers had not picked up the tab for this additional allocation, it would have been levied on farmers.  That is the story and it comes as a major relief to farmers.  Members were giving out hell about eyes in the sky and various other measurements officials were taking.  There was a legitimate expectation that everything would be done right.  I salute the Minister for taking action in this regard and I am pleased this has been achieved.  Thankfully, the economy has recovered to the extent that he is able to provide this funding.  Four or five years ago, he would not have been given one cent for this purpose.  From that perspective, this funding is welcome and I congratulate the Minister on securing it.<\/p> <p>  The initial figure was much larger, but the Minister and his officials brought the Commission around to accepting the bona fides of their argument for a reduction.  From that viewpoint, while I can be as critical as the next person, I like to speak up when a job has been done well.  Irish farmers will benefit from this achievement and I congratulate everybody concerned.  <\/p> <p>  Initially, there were negative vibes about the beef data and genomics scheme and attempts were made to throw it off course.  I stood 100% behind the scheme because I believe strongly that upgrading our herds is the only way to win high value markets.  I know this to be the case from a suckler cow herder in my area.  I advocated and exhorted farmers not to be taken in by criticisms of the scheme.  While there is an element of red tape involved, people will accept it if they see returns of &euro;150 or &euro;200.  The number of farmers participating in the scheme is approximately 3,000 lower than I expected.  Red tape may be part of the problem, although I know that age is also a factor, as are changes in applicable years and so forth.  I urge the Minister to ensure the scheme will not be short-changed next year and that sufficient money will be provided for it.  <\/p> <p>  My only criticism relates to the targeted agricultural measures scheme, TAMS.  I am not criticising what the Minister is doing as I regard the TAMS as a very good scheme.<\/p><p>A notorious number of farmers have planning permission and have been ready to go but there is no sign of approvals.  The Government is in its dying days.  A lot of farmers would lose out up to 40% if they went ahead.  I would say to the Minister as well that it is an attractive buy.  I accept it is a matter of numbers, but I know of some dairy farmers who are trying to get work done but who did not get approvals, and they were extremely disappointed.<\/p><p> We are trying to constantly upgrade.  It is important in the overall context of all of the debates, for example, in terms of what is going on in Paris at the world climate conference.  We must try to ensure that we meet the dates in any schemes we bring forward, from the departmental end as much as from the applicant's end.  The Department is in a position of strength.  The applicant is always in the weaker position and has to try to comply with all eligibility conditions, which are onerous, as they should be, to ensure that money is well spent.<\/p><p> Like Deputy Martin Ferris, I welcome the funding for the World Food Programme.  The Minister gave a commitment in that regard and he probably did not expect to be doubling it so quickly, but he did well here.  I certainly would support that.  We are entitled to make that contribution.  Hopefully, it will help those who have been suffering a great deal in terms of being dislodged from their environment, being relocated and becoming refugees.  I genuinely support that provision.<\/p><p> On the market volatility payment, the Chairman has been careful to bring in all the interested bodies, especially the dairy sector, to discussed this.  We have had representatives from the banks before the committee and others and have exhorted them to be fair to the farmers.  Of course, the banks gave great promises and we will watch them with interest to see that they adhere to the commitments they have given.  The Minister has matched it 100%, up the maximum that he is allowed.  The farmers should acknowledge that.<\/p><p> On areas of natural constraint, I note, like Deputy Martin Ferris, that those concerned about the hen harriers were in here and made a cogent and powerful case which we supported.  I hope the Minister can find some way to facilitate within one of those budgetary heads their legitimate desire to farm their lands, which are circumscribed by the imposition that has been dealing with the hen harrier, including the SACs and SPAs.<\/p><p> All in all, I welcome the announcement here today.

It is encouraging, when one sees the overall figure for disallowances around Europe, that we are way below the average.  It is 0.49% in Ireland and the overall EU average is 1.96%.  That is, I suppose, how we end up where we are today.  No doubt it would have been a bad news story if we could not come up with this funding for the farmers.  It is a huge relief that they will not be liable for it.<\/p> <p>  I will return to a point made by a previous speaker on the volatility in the market.  Deputy Penrose previously mentioned the volatility in the dairy sector.  It is welcome that there was a good package put in place by the Commission and now the Minister is matching that funding by 100%.  When does he propose to it to the farmers?<\/p> <p>  The dairy sector is in a volatile situation.  It could be the beef sector next year and the tillage sector or another sector the following year.  We are in an era of continuous volatility.  Are there plans in the Department to have a fund in place to cover such eventualities for the future?  It might be something worth considering in the event that there is a downward spiral in the future.<\/p> <p>  Regarding, in particular, Teagasc, and Bord Bia, I note in the Minister's presentation that the spend in Teagasc is 2% less, which is put down to there being fewer retirements.<\/p><p>Considering that Teagasc is going through a growth spurt with three times the normal number of students coming into the colleges and the expectation is that it will continue that way, should there be an increase rather than a reduction in spending or is it solely down to the retirement of staff?  I was of the opinion that there are extra staff required as well.  Extra staff were taken on board in Teagasc, particularly from an education point of view.  The Minister might clarify that point.<\/p><p> On beef data, it is encouraging that a significant number of farmers have signed up to the scheme after much initial confusion.  There has been a certain degree of flexibility in the scheme.  On the point Deputy Penrose made about the number of farmers who are still not in the scheme, will there be a review of the new scheme to cover any anomalies that may exist?<\/p><p> Finally, as regards the farm safety scheme that the Minister announced last year, he states that some farmers did not enter the original scheme and were waiting for the bigger scheme.  It is the small matters in farm safety that catch farmers.  It happens to every farm.  Even though the big scheme covers a lot of matters, is there a plan to have a continuous knowledge-based farm safety scheme for the future?  Knowledge is the key to farm safety.<\/p><p> Those, more or less, are my points.  I again welcome the fact that Irish farmers will not be held liable for the extra liabilities.  There is considerable relief about it.  It is not too often that there is a reasonably good news story.  From that point of view, I welcome it and compliment the Minister on ensuring that the farmers will not be liable for the extra liabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#M00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>There are two quick points I would like to make following on from points that were made by others.  One is on beef data.  If, as may be the case, it pans out that there is an ongoing underspend and the provision of &euro;52 million turns out not to be met, would the Minister consider providing a similar scheme to improve quality based on the same principles in the sheep sector?  Specifically, I am thinking of scrapie-free as being part and parcel of the conditions, and perhaps even EID tagging, although maybe not everyone would agree.  It is possibly something that could be used as a mechanism to get farmers to buy into it.<\/p> <p>  I suppose the Minister will not be surprised when I say my second point is about disease control.  The rates of tuberculosis, TB, are falling, but not where I come from.  On this issue, I must raise a flag.  There is a particular problem to do with the deer population, not specific to but very much to the fore in Wicklow's case, and it will spread.  While we have had cross-departmental meetings, when I mentioned to an official that perhaps the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would take a lead the official stated the Department did not have the resources.  There is a saving of &euro;6 million and the amount needed to put up a robust plan to deal with this problem in Wicklow is a mere fraction of that.

We anticipate that in a full year we will spend &euro;48 million on beef genomics.  We had said at the start that we would look at spending &euro;52 million and therefore there will be almost full spend.  This is a fund we want to spend on the beef sector because it was committed it.  I have said that we would look at it.  First, there will be a mid-term review of the genomics scheme.  Deputy Deering raised this point and we are going to review it.  If aspects are not working then we will change them, but we will have to get permission from the Commission to do that because this is a co-funded scheme.<\/p><p>Most farmers are quite comfortable with the beef genomics scheme now that they understand what is being asked of them.<\/p><p> Once the payments start flowing I believe this will be a very strongly supported scheme.  If anything, the requests I receive now are from people who want to join the scheme.  They had previously decided not to join but now would like to do so.  There is no easy way for them to join because the scheme involves a six-year commitment which means there are consequences if somebody joins late.  We will look at solving issues, if they need to be solved.  Potentially, there may be new entrants into beef production who may want to be part of this scheme.  If we have money unspent then I would have an open mind to looking at that aspect.<\/p><p> There will not be a massive shortfall of spend on beef genomics.  We anticipate that when this scheme is running properly it will spend about &euro;48 million in a year.  We have previously budgeted for &euro;52 million, so the scheme is almost fully catered for.  We will look at trying to allocate the extra &euro;4 million.<\/p><p> Farming organisations have come in here to raise issues about sheep.  In many ways, the sheep sector benefits the most from the new CAP scheme in terms of the redistribution of the single farm payment and so on.  We sought to protect the former sheep grassland scheme and to incorporate it into people's individual payments.  If we were to do a new sheep scheme and have it a little bit like the beef genomics scheme then we would have to go back to the Commission to amend the rural development programme, which would take some time.  We would also have to find money to provide the scheme.  Effectively, we would have to take money from some scheme that has already been approved.  This is not an easy process but I am not saying that I am totally closed to the idea.<\/p><p> If the scheme becomes a big priority, and if we were to look at it, then there is a whole series of things that need to happen before we could proceed in terms of getting agreement on a formal amendment of the rural development programme and finding the money by taking it from another scheme which, again, is not a straightforward process, to put it mildly.  I take the point and the issue has been raised.  I am not closed to the idea, I am simply saying that there is a process involved and if we want to prioritise the issue then it will take some time.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deering asked about a dairy fund for the future.

We have changed three-year income averaging to five-year income averaging so that people can average out their profits over five years rather than three years.  As a volatility management measure, we actively encourage dairy co-ops to look at medium-term fixed price models.  Glanbia and Kerry are already doing so and Dairygold is on the verge of putting a product together for farmers.  I am sure other organisations are looking at the issue.<\/p> <p>  Many farmers have tied themselves to two or three years of fixed prices for milk at 32 cent or 33 cent per litre base price.  They now look like they are in a pretty good position versus everybody else.  When they fixed their milk price many other farmers claimed they were mad because at the time the base price was 38 cent per litre.  Price volatility is the reason we have the dairy and beef forums.  We want to look at models whereby we can help to hedge against or ensure against the downside of price volatility.  Nobody wants not to benefit from the upside of prices either.  We want to take the highs and lows to ensure more consistent pricing.<\/p> <p>  There is no reason we cannot look at similar models for beef production.  I have more confidence in a successfully introduced producer organisation model for beef.  It means beef farmers have a professional negotiator who negotiates on behalf of multiple beef farmers using an economy of scale to negotiate with factories.  I would like see that model rolled out and that is what we are trying to bring to the beef forum.  At the moment, beef farmers are simply price takers when they turn up at a factory and that is not where they should be.<\/p> <p>  There are many things happening to deal with price volatility.<\/p><p>We could have looked at using rural development funds to put a crop insurance model in place.  Such a model would get farmers to put lump sums of money into an insurance model which we would top up.  The problem with such an initiative is that often some farmers will pay for other farmers who may have a price difficulty.  That model has not been very successful across the European Union so not very many countries are going for it, as far as I can see.  I am very interested in coming back here to have a debate on our response to price volatility across the sectors because it is an interesting policy area.<\/p><p> We are also looking at a proper and active futures market in Ireland for dairy product that co-ops can use.  If a small co-op can buy product on a futures market then it can offer its farmers guaranteed prices, if members know what I am saying.  Such an initiative is used in the US all of the time and we could do it much more effectively here.  We are looking at bringing a model for a futures market in Ireland to the dairy forum the next time it meets.<\/p><p> Teagasc has reduced its number of staff retirements from 50 to 31 which produced a saving of &euro;3.3 million in lump sums in 2015.  It is important to say that it has been agreed to assign Teagasc an extra 37 temporary staff to ensure that every farmer is accommodated in the context of the green certificate qualification many young farmers seek at the moment.  The initiative brings the overall allocation of temporary resources for the green certificate qualification to an extra 77 people in Teagasc.  We are conscious that the issue needs help and there will be more support where that came from.  Teagasc needs more staff not only in education but in terms of its consultancy work.  The freeze on recruitment across the public sector is being loosened.  Teagasc is an obvious example of an organisation that will benefit from that and spend a bit more.  <\/p><p> In terms of Deputy Penrose, I expected - as did a lot of farmers - that they would have to pay for a significant portion of the disallowance that was being applied to Ireland.  Irish farmers were never going to have to pay all of it but they expected to have to pay a decent chunk of it.  We now have agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we would clear it this year.  That means the worry and burden that farmers have been concerned about in places like west Cork, Kerry and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#O00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>We never thought we were going to pay for it.

It is always dangerous to say that people have been vindicated.  However, the beef genomics scheme seems to be very popular and quite successful.  If it needs to be amended then we will do so but I think the scheme is working.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about TAMS approvals.  As many as 1,000 dairy farmers applied for TAMS II.  We simply cannot give all of those approvals out before the end of the year as there are many things happening in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of huge volumes of money being paid to farmers across multiple schemes ranging from basic payments, areas of natural constraint, ANCs, GLAS, AEOS, TAMS, beef genomics, island payments and so on.  We simply do not have the number of staff required to go on to farms and grant approval to 1,000 applicants.  We have got people to ring up the 1,000 farmers to find out which ones desperately need to get dairy facilities in place early.  For example, there are young farmers who are breeding heifers for milking who do not have any milking facilities.  They are new entrants so through TAMS they have to get their milking facilities in place quickly before calves are born and they will be prioritised.<\/p><p>We hope to be able to obtain approval for about 200 of the 1,000 before the end of the year and, obviously, the rest will be approved in January.  When I say to farmers that we have to prioritise, most of them accept it.  We will try to be as practical as we can in order to prioritise the cases that need to be prioritised the earliest.  <\/p><p> We are doing a lot about the hen harrier.  Essentially, we have designed an element of the GLAS plus scheme to facilitate hen harrier farming.  The commitment made to farmers who have land designated by the previous Government which let everybody down was that they would be paid &euro;370 per hectare.  About &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million was set aside for about 4,000 farmers with designated lands.  It was disastrous and farmers felt they had been treated terribly and in a dishonest way in an effort to have the designation of land agreed to.  We have now responded to solve that problem which was not of the Department's making, whereby a significant proportion of the farmers with designated land for the hen harrier under the GLAS scheme will receive &euro;370 per hectare up to 19 hectares.  Next year we will introduce an area based targeted scheme that will allow for extra payments to be made to farmers who have more than 19 hectares of land up to a ceiling which we have not yet set.  I do not want to put a figure on it, but the scheme will allow for a significant increase in payments to farmers with much restricted designated land.  We anticipate that we might be spending about &euro;23 million per year which is a lot of money to spend in the case of one bird.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#P00800","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Will there be retrospective payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#Q00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>We cannot make such payments because we were not in charge of the scheme until we designed the GLAS scheme to try to resolve the hen harrier issue.

They seem to be happy about this.  We are looking through the threat response plan to try to provide greater flexibility for them in terms of afforestation.  That is a subject of discussion between us and the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In terms of raw payments, we are going to go from spending about &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million to spending potentially &euro;23 million to &euro;25 million if all such farmers avail of the GLAS scheme and another top-up scheme.

It took a while to negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which needed to understand the reason it was important, but we have a full top-up payment to which dairy farmers can look forward to receiving.  It is not massive, but it will make a difference between now and the end of the year and I hope it will provide some insulation in dealing with the difficulties being faced on price.  We are budgeting to pay out a sum of &euro;24.8 million.  The total amount is &euro;27.4 million, minus &euro;1.6 million for young farmers and &euro;1 million for those involved in the pig sector.

The Irish people are very anxious to make a practical commitment to try to alleviate the suffering of refugees.  There are about 4 million Syrian refugees living in refugee camps which is almost the population of Ireland.  The World Food Programme is the largest humanitarian organisation on the planet and is feeding most of these refugees.  I thought it was a very good way to spend money.  The money is not tied entirely to refugee camps, but we have given an indication that we would like it to be spent on refugees, where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#Q00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>To which camps does it go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#R00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We will not itemise them.

We simply would not have this money if we were not spending it on the World Food Programme.  It is part of Ireland's overall development aid contribution.  In case farmers think we are taking it from the moneys for areas of natural constraint, ANC, or the beef genomics scheme, we are not.  The money for the World Food Programme is spent through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because we have a very good relationship with the organisation.  I have just been to Ghana.  It is the Department of food, as well as agriculture.  It is part of the Government's broader commitment to provide development aid and humanitarian assistance and is being paid through the Department and has more than doubled.  A sum of &euro;60 million for the World Food Programme over the next three years represents a significant commitment and if people want to know what it means, one can feed two refugees in Syria for $1 dollar a day.   Therefore, &euro;60 million will go a long way in feeding people who have nothing in terms of possessions or finance.<\/p> <p>  We are making phenomenal progress in dealing with TB.  It is a great story.  We have saved a large amount of money, but, more importantly, we are moving towards trying to eradicate it.  My personal ambition is to eradicate in Ireland by 2030, which is possible as a result of conversations we have had with veterinary officers and so on.<\/p><p>It is the first time ever that we are actively talking about eradicating TB entirely from Ireland.  That is a statement that will probably be quoted back to me in the future but that is what we would like to do.  We will keep the pressure on to try to eradicate TB.  We clearly need to have a more focused effort on doing that in places like Wicklow.  There has been a 40% reduction in the incidence of it since 2008 and a 7% reduction since 2014.  That is 1,000 fewer animals, so that is a great saving.  <\/p><p> On the brucellosis side, we are now brucellosis free on the island of Ireland.  They have done great work in Northern Ireland in eradicating brucellosis.  They were well behind us on that.  Until they were brucellosis free in Northern Ireland we could not make a statement that Ireland as an island is brucellosis free because of the movement of cattle across the Border.  My colleague in the North has done very well on that.  It has been a joint effort and there has been a great outcome.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question about the islands, my understanding is that we are budgeting for spending of &euro;2.5 million for the islands this year.  In terms of areas of natural constraint, ANCs, to be clear on this, the profile for ANCs that we set was for &euro;189 million to be spent by the end of November and we have spent &euro;189.5 million, so we are bang on with what we said we would do on ANCs.  If we have more room to spend money, I am very anxious to get money out to disadvantaged areas, particularly given the weather we are facing at the moment.  There is always stacking each year because payments carry over into January.  Sometimes that is a useful tool for staying within budget and sometimes we can try to prioritise to get more spend in one year, which is what we are trying to do this year in that we are trying to get extra money out to farmers that are in ANC or disadvantaged areas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2015120800002#R00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449583200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Where is the &euro;115 million behind in terms of the profile if the spending profile for those areas is &euro;0.5 million over?

It is not an unreasonable question.  The profile, which is the best estimate of the timing of expenditure when drawn up in January, which is the start of the year, is difficult to forecast and actual expenditure, as we clearly see, may vary significantly during the year for various reasons, such as levels of payments under demand-led schemes, the pattern of drawdown of grants by State bodies, the level of disease incidences and payments of compensation.  The delay relative to profiled capital expenditure is attributable to a number of expenditure subheads, including the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the fishery harbour centres and the remediation of Haulbowline Island.  Significant expenditure is expected in each of these in December and where capital funding is not spent, provisions exist whereby a percentage of the allocation can be carried over to the following year but we are seeking to try to get it done this year, with the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure.<\/p> <p>  On current expenditure, significant payments under schemes, such as the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and areas of natural constraint, ANC, are planned for December.  We are slightly behind schedule but the Estimate we give in January varies during the year.

The Government also agreed to a proposal by the Minister for Finance that the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance would work together on any necessary additional amendments to the Bill relating to a role for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  <\/p><p>I informed the House it was intended to move Committee Stage amendments to provide for a new section setting out in law the detailed criteria under which the Minister shall calculate premiums, primarily that they should not exceed the level needed to defray or partially defray the costs of the scheme, and clarifications to ensure finance providers meet applicable law in respect of the conduct of their business under the legislation.  <\/p><p>These technical amendments were circulated last week and cover premium setting and clarification of the need for finance providers to meet all appropriate legal requirements before being eligible to benefit from the guarantees.  These changes will impact on sections 5 and 8 dealing with the power of the Minister to make schemes in consultation with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and his powers to set different premia for different schemes.<\/p><p>In addition I indicated there would be important changes in a new and separate part of the Bill under the following headings.  One, provision for State promotion of financial institutions that will in future work with the Minister through this legislation to enhance provision of credit to SMEs and two, a role for the Minister to be able to give counter guarantees intended to enable promotion of financial institutions to unlock matching guarantee facilities from EU sources and share the risk across banks; and the promotion of finance providers, for example, the SBCI, the Minister and a number of potential EU sources.  In respect of the latter, it is envisaged this counter guarantee would operate in conjunction with the leveraging of related EU financial instruments in this area, such as the European Programme for Competitiveness of SMEs, COSME, Horizon 2020 funding earmarked for SMEs and the European Fund for Strategic Investment, EFSI, administered by the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund - the Juncker plan.  In this way Ireland will be able to optimise its return from major EU initiatives.  <\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Finance completed work with the Office of the Attorney General on these points and the appropriate revisions were circulated to the House last week.  The amendments are, by and large, contained in a new Part 3 of the Bill, sections 9 to 15, inclusive.  Arising from the additional part, there are some technical amendments to the earlier parts of the Bill which I will flag as we proceed.<\/p><p>During the debate on Second Stage I stressed that the overarching economic need to ensure Irish firms had the full suite of financial and other supports available to enable them to compete internationally was paramount.  The Bill and the additional revisions to it will ensure that in the area of credit guarantees, Ireland will have a framework that will be more than just fit for purpose, covering an extensive suite of products, it will ensure we will have the ability to make best use of the EU funding made available to member states by means of risk-sharing financial instruments.  The Bill and the Committee Stage amendments I have outlined, particularly those that will facilitate the leveraging of EU funding, will significantly benefit firms, employees, SMEs and the economy at large.<\/p><p> I flag to the committee my intention to submit three further amendments on Report Stage which will impact on employment rights, the Workplace Relations Act and the Companies Act.  They are purely technical in nature and will enable the recently enacted legislation to be fully effective.  <\/p><p> As I said, the Bill and the Committee Stage amendments contain major changes to the 2012 Act.  One of the proposals is that the original section 1, with its brief definition of the principal Act, be deleted.  A Part 1 break is being inserted and the new section 1 will deal with citations and the like, mirroring section 10 of the 2012 Act.  The new section 2 will contain the necessary definitions of \"Minister\" and \"Principal Act\" which currently are included with other definitions but which are being moved because they apply to all parts of the Bill, with section 1 being deleted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#A00325","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote><b>2. <\/b>In page 3, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Definitions<\/b><b>2. <\/b>In this Act&mdash;<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Section 1 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to. \r\n\r\nSECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:&ldquo;(c) the finance provider is a crowd funder which operates as a credit facility and its liquidity is sourced from the general public and provides loans to businesses in a peer to peer arrangement.<br \/><br \/>(d) the finance provider is a credit union which operates in Ireland under Central Bank regulations.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Much of the debate on the credit guarantee scheme from its inception has been about the fact that the banking system is broken.  These are new products that have been designed to fill the gaps left by the banking system which is not working properly.  We have, to all intents and purposes, an oligopoly in the State and need to make sure we have other elements in the credit system that can function properly and add to the choices for consumers of credit.  The amendment deals with two unloved sectors of the credit ecosystem.  <\/p><p>It is welcome that the Minister of State has broadened the credit facilities that may be used in the future under the Bill.  However, on Second Stage I brought to his attention the necessity of using crowd funding as an opportunity for the State to funnel cash towards small businesses.  In Britain, for example, 10% of all crowd funding loans are backed by the State.  The sector is very small here and it is finding it hard to gain traction owing to the lack of backup from the State.  That is why it is necessary for the Government to include crowd funding as part of the credit guarantee process.  <\/p><p>The second area about which the amendment speaks is the credit union sector.  We dealt with a Private Member's Bill recently and representatives of the credit union movement appeared before the joint committee.  The credit unions stated they had &euro;13 billion in capital for which they needed a home.  They also referred to the fact that they were very well regulated and had come through the crash unscathed in comparison to the banking sector.  In that context, I call on the Minister of State to make sure these two key components which will provide opportunities in the future, in terms of credit, are included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00700","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendments proposed which will make this a far superior Bill to the one originally published.

The credit union movement is open for business and very keen to get involved in SME lending, in particular.  Unfortunately, however, it is being rebuffed at every opportunity in being allowed to exploit its asset base and encourage its membership which is locally based to support locally rooted SMEs.  The obstruction is in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but in the Department of Finance and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  This is an opportunity to rebrand the scheme.  The success of Microfinance Ireland since its reorganisation is a clear indication of the demand for small-scale SME lending.  The credit union movement and crowd funders are ideally suited to meet that demand.  Several crowd funders have made presentations to the joint committee.  What could be done through this channel is phenomenal, particularly for new enterprises and start-up companies which are still finding it very difficult to obtain funding.  Crowd funders are ideally situated and the inclusion of such funds would truly bring the Bill into the 21st century.  We should partner with crowd funders and the credit union movement in the provision of SME funding.  The credit union movement is very keen to get involved, but it is being rebuffed at every turn by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B00800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment, in extending the scope of the legislation and introducing additional flexibility, there will be scope to examine how a range of finance providers can operate under the Bill.

One of the key points put forward by the credit unions when they made presentations to the Oireachtas was their deep frustration in regard to the limiting of their ability to function within the SME sector.  It is difficult to understand that in a credit squeeze, the sector that least abused its position now feels it is being limited by the Government and Central Bank regulations with regard to trying to provide small loans to small businesses.<\/p><p> I would not mind so much if the Minister of State told me credit unions could be involved, but could only provide microfinance, like Microfinance Ireland for example which has a &euro;50,000 or &euro;75,000 ceiling on its ability to loan.  I would agree that this would be a prudent first step in their foray into this space.  In representing these sectors, SMEs and entrepreneurs in society, we as Opposition Deputies should at least commit to ensuring that they will be included in this scheme in the future.  Otherwise, we are just involved in creating loose legislation that does not address the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#B01400","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>We in the Department and I, as a constituency Deputy, are in constant contact with the credit union sector, as is the Department of Finance, in regard to the role of credit unions and how that will evolve in the context of the SME sector.

As far as I understand, there has been no significant detail from the credit unions regarding how they intend to operate in that sector in the future.  The Government and the Oireachtas should be always mindful of the role credit unions and other alternative financiers and finance organisations can play in supporting the SME sector.<\/p> <p>  Clearly there is a difference of opinion between us and the Deputy in regard to how we accommodate the role of the credit unions, crowd funders and others, but the definition of \"finance providers\" in this legislation is sufficiently wide to include crowd funders and credit unions.

Section 4 of the principal Act, entitled power of Minister to give guarantees, contained a number of important elements, including the spread of risk and an effective monetary cap of &euro;11.25 million.  That is being increased to take into account the counter guarantee scheme as well.

The Government agreed to increase the 75% and 10% figures to 80% and 13%, respectively.  The latter is in line with state aid requirements and as Deputies are aware, there are serious state aid issues relating to how these types of schemes are operated right across the European Union.

This will achieve that goal.  There is much potential to increase lending without a commensurate increase to the risk and exposure for the State.  That is why we must get the balance right.

Similarly, with Microfinance Ireland there is an understanding of its work and what is available there, which is useful from an SME perspective.  This is a demand-led scheme so we cannot at this point measure how many SMEs want to become involved.  Nor can we measure precisely the type of demands on the scheme over the next period.

Section 5 of the principal Act is primarily about the schemes made under legislation to date, namely during 2012 and 2015.  The amendments to section 5 of the Bill are to ensure new schemes can adequately cover the expanded types of financial products to be covered.  There are also some amendments covering matters flagged on Second Stage, particularly subsection (d) which is a necessary cross reference to the correct part of the new section 8 on policies and principles on the matter of charging a premium to cover the Minister's costs.  I will return to this topic later.  I commend amendment No. 12 to the committee.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 19, section 8 of the principal Act relates to payment of premia to the Minister.  The substitution is designed to take account of the types of products and the need for flexibility in the rate referred to.  By this approach we have, in effect, already gone a long way towards accepting the principle of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendments and the revised section 8 meets his requirement which regards credit unions and crowd funding, while also ensuring appropriate scope for flexible application of the legislation.  I commend the revised section 8 to the committee.<\/p><p>I will now turn to amendment No. 26.  Under the current legislation on credit guarantees, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation receives a premium in respect of the guarantees issued.  This amendment provides that the charging structure for the counter guarantee schemes operates within the charging structures and principles contained in the Bill.  It will be designed to ensure the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will receive the same level of premium adjusted to reflect the level of risk to which the Minister is exposed in each counter guarantee scheme.  When determining the level of premium, the Minister must have regard to a number of factors as set out in the amendment.  These include the objectives of the scheme and the likely expense of running the scheme.  The manner in which the premium will be calculated must be clearly set out in each counter guarantee scheme.  The amendment provides that the premium for a counter guarantee can only be used towards defraying the cost of the scheme.  In this way the cost of the premium will be kept as low as possible for the SMEs accessing finance under such schemes.  I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#G01700","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I tabled amendment No. 20 because credit is too expensive in this State, be it for those in mortgage distress who are paying a premium over their counterparts throughout Europe or small businesses who are paying a premium over that being charged to European banks - and this is even outside the credit guarantee scheme.  Paying for credit at such an enormous rate is a competitive disadvantage for Irish SMEs.  The credit rate might have been acceptable at a time when the banks were actually in a loss making situation and needed to make profits but we have seen some massive profits come from the banks in recent times.

A case could be made, when looking at future schemes, to take an approach to a particular sector and design a specific scheme - or if there is an attractive opportunity to do that -  in order to address a structural problem in a targeted way for example.  The premium could be reduced or amended to assist that sector.  Flexibility is included to allow this to happen.  The 2% premium is still there but there is flexibility.  The 2% applies to the credit guarantee scheme and the counter guarantee scheme and absolutely goes towards defraying the costs of the credit guarantee scheme which applies to the enterprise.

In a mortgage situation for example, any family who pays 5.3% will know the difference on their monthly repayments to a family who pays 3.3%.

Flexibility is enshrined in the Bill to allow a response to those situations.  I hope colleagues can support this.  The figure of 2% is the understood rate at the moment and there is a cost involved in operating a scheme like this.  These are resources that would be flown to SMEs that would not otherwise find their way to SMEs, in the absence of a scheme like this.

We have accepted the vast bulk of the review.  We commissioned that review and understood that changes had to be made.  I accept that it has been frustrating for everybody that it has taken a long time to get to the point where we can make amendments to the legislation to allow for the scheme to operate to its fullest potential.  However, I am very confident that it will do so.<\/p> <p>  It is normal procedure for the operator of the scheme, Capita Asset Services, to provide quarterly reports and they are published on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is not proposed to legislate to allow that happen.  Rather, it is proposed that we continue with the current arrangements under the revised legislation.  Those arrangements cover the credit guarantee and the counter guarantee elements.  We do this already and it is important that such information is available to be assessed by anyone who wishes to determine the success, or otherwise, of the scheme.  I assure Deputies that where any scheme is not meeting its potential, we will make any changes necessary.  We were very upfront about the gaps, deficits and deficiencies in this particular scheme and that is why we worked to address them as quickly as possible.  We all have a responsibility to work with SMEs to provide the jobs that we all want to see and we all have a responsibility to ensure that our finance system is functioning.<\/p> <p>  More generally, material on rates of bank lending to SMEs is more broadly a matter for the Minister for Finance.  In that context, it would not be appropriate to include such a provision in this legislation.  The Deputy's amendment is not appropriate to this legislation on credit guarantees but we will be publishing information in the normal way.  That information will be available to the public to allow them to make an assessment of the scheme.  Where there are issues arising, they will be addressed.  I am optimistic and confident that the amended scheme and the approach we are now taking will herald a new dawn for SMEs.  We have done the same with Microfinance Ireland and the figures for that body are improving all of the time.  We changed the way the Microfinance Ireland scheme operates and made it more attractive and accessible to micro-enterprises who need to use it.  We are not averse to holding our hands up, admitting that something is not working, fixing it when necessary and working with our colleagues in the Oireachtas to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04400","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04500","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, line 5, after &ldquo;2012;&rdquo; to insert the following:&ldquo;to enable the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, pursuant to a counter guarantee scheme made by that Minister of the Government, to give counter guarantees to promotional financial institutions for guarantees given by the institutions to finance providers in respect of finance agreements entered into by the finance providers with qualifying enterprises; to place a yearly monetary limit on the potential liability of that Minister of the Government in respect of all credit guarantee schemes and counter guarantee schemes taken together;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#H04900","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1449581400,"counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#J00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1449581400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 87, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <p>  The Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2015 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015120800002#J00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449581400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned sine die.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee on Education and Social Protection: Select Sub-Committee on Education and Skills","time":1449581400,"counter":307},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Conaghan, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan (Minister for Education and Skills), Deputy Charlie McConalogue, Deputy Brendan Ryan.

My Department provided background briefing material to the committee and, therefore, I propose to keep this opening statement brief.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate sought will increase my Department&rsquo;s overall net voted allocation from &euro;8.012 billion to &euro;8.187 billion.  The additional &euro;175 million sought comprises &euro;125 million for current expenditure and &euro;50 million for capital expenditure.  A sum of &euro;40 million in current funding is required to cover the cost of a projected 600 additional retirements across the education sector in 2015.  While 1,540 retirements were originally provided for, the number being forecast is in excess of 2,150 retirements.  The additional funding is required to meet both the lump sum element and the ongoing pension cost element of the additional retirees.  My Department has little control over this component of expenditure.  Estimating the number of retirements in recent years has been difficult, due in part to the extension of the grace periods with regard to the calculation of retirement salaries - subheads A8 and C10 refer.  A further &euro;78 million in current funding is required to cover additional costs associated with third level student supports in 2015, &euro;61 million of which is needed to alleviate financial pressures being experienced by higher education institutions, HEIs, by bringing forward to December 2015 payments in respect of the student contribution that were originally due to be paid to the HEIs in January 2016.  An additional &euro;17 million is required, in large part to meet upward demographic pressures not originally provided for - subhead C11 refers.<\/p> <p>   The &euro;50 million required in capital expenditure is needed to progress projects under the 2014 summer works scheme that were not progressed or finalised in that year.  Applications were submitted by schools in November 2013 for inclusion in the 2014 scheme.  A total of 787 schools were initially approved to undertake school improvements across five categories of projects - gas, electrical, mechanical, the upgrade of toilet facilities and roof improvements.  Schools whose applications were not reached in 2014 were advised that their applications would be reviewed in the event that funding became available.<\/p><p>In April last, a further 559 schools were approved to undertake works across the remaining four project categories - upgrading and replacement of windows, school specialist room refurbishment, school building improvements and external works such as closed circuit television and fencing.  The total value of these projects was &euro;108 million and &euro;50 million is needed to complete this work in 2015 - subhead D3 refers.<\/p><p> A further &euro;6 million is required to provide for the increase in demand in the number of students requiring access to special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools, including students in special classes and students enrolling in special schools.  Government approval for an additional 610 SNAs was granted in July 2015.  This builds on the increases of 365 additional SNA posts provided for in last year&rsquo;s budget and the 390 additional SNA posts announced in December 2013.  The July 2015 decision increased SNA numbers from 11,330 to 11,940, and represents an increase of 11.7% in SNA posts available for allocation to schools since the Government came to office - subhead A6 refers.<\/p><p> A total of &euro;12 million is required to cover an estimated shortfall in appropriations-in-aid receipts, due to an overestimation of the level of these receipts to be brought to account in 2015.  These receipts mainly cover superannuation contributions, pension-related deduction receipts and European Social Fund receipts.  The receipts are effectively offset against the Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure figure to produce the figure for net expenditure.  The 2015 Revised Estimates allocation provided for receipts of &euro;573 million, but this will reduce to &euro;561 million in the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> All these additional expenditure requirements amount to &euro;186 million.  However, my Department has also identified offsetting net savings of &euro;11 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  These savings arise on subhead B5, covering grants to SOLAS in respect of further education and training activities.  The net saving of &euro;11 million comprises savings of &euro;14 million.  Based on expenditure returns received from the education and training boards, ETBs, there is an estimated accumulated surplus of &euro;14 million in the Exchequer funding from SOLAS to the boards in respect of further education grants.  SOLAS has agreed with the ETBs to recoup these surpluses by reducing the final tranche of payments to be made to them before the end of the current financial year.  The saving of &euro;14 million in the ETBs will be offset by additional expenditure of &euro;3 million, which will be required to cover the cost of the 75% Christmas bonus announced by the Minister for Social Protection in budget 2016.

However, there is a band within which the Minister can project that demand will be similar to the previous year plus a bit extra.  For those who are moving from junior to high infants, if they had an SNA in junior infants there is every likelihood they will carry it on to senior infants, and likewise through all the classes.

It will even off at primary level around 2019 or 2020 but will not do so at third level until we are way into the late 2020s or further on.

The total additional funding being sought for 2015 is &euro;665 million.  However, this figure is offset by the receipt of an additional &euro;65 million in respect of the UK-Ireland bilateral health care reimbursement agreement, leaving a net requirement of &euro;600 million, as indicated on budget day.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health is one of many Departments seeking a Supplementary Estimate this year.  While the amount sought is significant, it is worth noting that it represents less than 5% of overall health expenditure.  In percentage terms, the Department of Health does not have the largest Supplementary Estimate this year, but the Supplementary Estimate does recognise the particular challenges to be balanced in the health sector and the priority the Government attaches to addressing unmet needs.<\/p> <p>  Rising employment levels and an improving economy have made extra spending on the health service and in other priority areas of public expenditure possible, while still comfortably achieving our deficit and debt reduction targets.  We need to keep the recovery going and the economy strong in order that in the years to come we can hire more nurses, therapists and medical specialists and provide more services and new infrastructure.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. <\/p> <p>  There are significant drivers of demand and costs within health services which are a source of pressure on health budgets.  We face a growing and ageing population, with a considerable burden of chronic illness.  New expensive technologies are developed and approved every year.  There will always be more that we would like to do in the health service than we can afford, but thankfully, because of our very strong economic recovery, we can afford to do more now than we could during the economic crisis.  <\/p> <p>  It is welcome that this year's economic performance has provided us with scope to significantly increase budgets and provide for additional acute hospital capacity, long-stay and home support for older people, new drugs and appliances, additional discretionary medical cards and access to universal GP services for the very young and the very old for the first time.  In each of these service areas the funding sought will allow additional people in need of health and social care to benefit.  There is also provision in the Supplementary Estimate for unavoidable costs in 2015 outside these service areas.  It is preferable, where there is room to do so, that these be addressed without the need for reductions in service areas.  It is also welcome that, in general, where responses and service improvements have been approved and implemented in 2015, the funding is in place for their continuation into 2016.  This will provide an enhanced basis on which to address the health needs of the population next year.  <\/p> <p>  I will now set out the items making up the Supplementary Estimate.  During the course of 2015 I took the initiative to discuss with Government colleagues the need to anticipate and deal with emerging problems in a number of critical areas of the health service.  In particular, specific target initiatives were approved to reduce delayed discharges in acute hospitals, waiting lists and emergency department overcrowding.  We all know that the health service is constrained in its capacity to respond to growing demands, particularly for acute hospital services.  While we cannot introduce all the capacity required overnight, we worked with hospitals and community services to address responses that could be introduced relatively quickly.  <\/p> <p>  The problems in emergency departments are the manifestation of wider operational and capacity weaknesses.  The emergency department task force was convened last December and came up with a set of recommendations to reduce emergency department overcrowding.  I acted to support their implementation and secured an additional &euro;74 million to do so.  This funding came on top of measures already taken in budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provided alternatives to and relieve pressure on acute hospitals.  This funding has allowed us to reduce the waiting time for the fair deal nursing home support scheme from 15 weeks to four.  This cost approximately &euro;44 million and an additional &euro;35 million will be provided next year to keep the waiting time at two to four weeks.  It has also allowed us to open another 150 community beds, including at Mount Carmel Community Hospital, formerly a private hospital, and at Moorehall Lodge in Drogheda under a public private partnership arrangement.  These and other measures have, in turn, reduced the number of delayed discharges in hospitals from 850 to 558 as of 1 December.  This means that almost 300 acute beds have been freed up and are available every day to treat acutely ill patients.<\/p> <p>  We have also used the funding to keep patients out of hospital altogether or allow them to return home earlier through community intervention teams.  These are nurse-led teams of health professionals who provide a rapid and integrated response in the community or home for patients with an acute episode of an illness who require enhanced services for a defined, short period of time.  The community intervention teams provide a range of services, including administration of intravenous antibiotics at home, wound care and dressings and enhanced nurse monitoring following fractures, falls or surgery.  Last month an infusion service commenced in north Dublin.  This community based service provided by the community intervention team is linked with Dublin's northside hospitals.<\/p><p>There are currently ten community intervention teams in operation across the country and it is expected that a new team will commence operations in Waterford shortly, under CareLock.  To date this year, more than 16,500 patients have received a community intervention team service.  On average, this equates to a saving of between five and ten hospital bed days per patient and represents a significant saving on hospital resources.  It is better for patients and avoids unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitals stays.  We need to do a lot more of this in the years to come.<\/p><p> At the start of the year I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June 2015 and 15 months by year end.  Additional funding of &euro;51 million has been provided to ensure that these maximum waiting times are achieved.  The funding provided is intended to fully utilise capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs within the maximum allowable waiting time.<\/p><p> The latest NTPF figures, published yesterday, continue to show improvements in waiting times with significant reduction in those waiting longest now clearly evident.  For November, reductions were achieved in the total inpatient day case waiting list, and in the numbers of patients waiting longer than 15 months and waiting longer than 18 months.  Similarly, there are reductions in the total number of people waiting for outpatient appointments, which has now fallen below 386,000 for the first time this year.  As Deputies will be aware those figures include anybody who is waiting any amount of time, even if only a few weeks.  Through facilitating additional clinics outside conventional working hours or by outsourcing where capacity is limited, the end of November sees a reduction of more than 11,000 in the overall outpatient waiting lists and of more than 10,000 in the number of people waiting more than 15 months for appointments.  It is encouraging to see that the number of people waiting more than 18 months has also decreased by 4,000.  The reductions being achieved are very welcome and I want to ensure these very positive trends are sustained and continue.  Further additional funding of &euro;18 million was provided in July for a winter initiative, which includes the provision of approximately 300 additional hospital beds across the country in November and December.<\/p><p> The situation in emergency departments is extremely challenging and I recognise the difficulties experienced by patients and the frustration of staff.  However, we are seeing some improvement as the measures taken and under way make a difference.  These measures are fully in line with the recommendations of the emergency department task force and are now generating results.  The special delivery unit figures show an 8% drop in the number of patients on trolleys in November 2015 compared to November 2014.  While INMO figures for the month of November show a 3% rise, it is significant that the INMO's own figures show an 8% drop in the second half of November.  Today, for example, the special delivery unit recorded a peak of 325 people of trolleys, 135 for more than nine hours.  That is a 20% drop on this day last year, when the number was 404.  Today's figures for the Irish Nurses Midwives Organisation, taking both trolley watch and ward watch together, put the number at 411, down 15% on this time last year when the number was 461.  It is nothing to celebrate but it shows we are moving in the right direction for the first time in a long time.<\/p><p> Further beds are due to open this month.  We are headed in the right direction and must persist with the considerable efforts under way right across our health service.  The November numbers, or today's numbers, whichever are used, are a big change from August when overcrowding was 40% worse than August 2014 and it is clear that things are not as bad as was the situation early in the new year when there were 500 to 600 people on trolleys.  These were all real actions taken on my directions, with resources I secured, with the assistance of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  These actions are starting to show some results.  These are actions and solutions, not commentary, criticism and analysis which is all we get from the Opposition. The HSE director general and his team are working closely with the worst affected hospitals and there will be a continuing focus on achieving further improvements throughout the winter and into next year.  There are expenditure overruns in acute hospitals, social care services and the PCRS and the factors are different in each case.<\/p><p> Acute hospitals are projected to be &euro;149 million in deficit by the end of the year.  The deficit is predominantly caused by non-pay cost pressures, with non-pay costs projected to grow by 5.5% in 2015 compared to 2014.  All hospitals internationally are seeking to manage such costs which are associated with the increased age and complexity of patients being treated.  I notice that many chest hospitals this year are &euro;2 billion over budget.  Additional payroll costs have been incurred including through the recruitment of some 2,300 additional acute hospital staff, of which significant numbers are front-line doctors and nurses.  The impact of risk-related reports and difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical and nursing staff has put strong upward pressure on pay costs in some hospitals.  Having a stable, well trained workforce in place is essential for the performance of hospitals in terms of access, quality and cost.  With the removal of the recruitment moratorium this year progress was made by a number of hospitals in this area but others have more work to do.  There has been underachievement in certain cost reduction initiatives.  That being said, it is projected that &euro;25 million in savings will be made on agency expenditure compared to 2014 levels, which is a significant saving.  However, this is less than the target for the year and there will be a continuing focus on this area in 2016, particularly for those hospitals that did not make as much progress as expected.  We see considerable variation from one hospital group to the next in terms of how they managed their budgets this year.<\/p><p> The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, has a projected deficit of some &euro;151 million.  This comprises a deficit of &euro;136 million on schemes administered centrally and a deficit of &euro;15 million on locally administered schemes, including for the provision of aids and appliances, such as crutches and wheelchairs.  The PCRS overspend is driven predominantly by increased expenditure on the long-term illness, LTI, and the GMS schemes, including high-tech medicines.  The increased burden of chronic illness, including diabetes, is seeing the costs of the LTI scheme grow significantly.<\/p><p> The introduction and increased prescribing of new and innovative but highly expensive medicines is increasing the cost of the high-tech medicines scheme.  Earlier this year, agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a package of measures, including terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children under six years and the provision of GP care without fees to seniors aged 70 years and over.  These represent the first phase in the delivery of universal health care.  We intend to move on to children aged six to 12 years in the next phase.  The introduction of universal GP services for the very young and the old has been highly successful.  As of 1 December some 2,242 GPs or 93% of all GMS contract holders have signed under-six contracts.  More than 214,000 children have been signed up for the new service.<\/p><p> The new enhanced service involves age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments are being carried out once when a child is aged two and again at age five.  This is important in identifying issues such as childhood obesity early on.  The contract also covers an agreed cycle of care for children under six years diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs are carrying out an annual review of each child.  As of 1 December, 18,700 children have been registered for the new service under the Asthma Cycle of Care by their GPs.  With regard to the universal GP service for seniors aged 70 or over, more than 49,000 people have already signed up for the service.<\/p><p> The HSE, Department and the IMO have commenced talks on a new comprehensive GP contract.  A priority of these discussions will be further enhancement of chronic disease management for patients.  As a first step in this process, agreement was reached on the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care for adult patients with type 2 diabetes who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  The cycle of care aims to augment the service available to diabetic patients prior to the introduction of a comprehensive structured chronic disease programme.  The cycle of care commenced on 1 December and to date more than 59,000 patients have been registered for the new service by their GPs. <\/p><p> On the increased costs of operating the PCRS, at the end of October there were 95,887 people covered by a discretionary medical card - the most recent figures are more than 100,000 - an increase of 23,000 since October 2014.  This reflects the significant changes made to the rules and guidelines for discretionary medical cards more than a year ago.<\/p><p> Social care services give rise to a net requirement of &euro;53 million additional funding.  The main issue within social care relates to disability services with a deficit of &euro;48 million.  Significant staffing and once-off minor capital pressures have arisen in response to the enhanced regulatory focus by HIQA on disability residential services.  This enhanced focus, with external inspection and publication of reports, is a very good thing and is in line with the legislation adopted by this House.  The problems being identified by HIQA in disability services and in care for older people cannot be new, they must have been going on for decades.  The difference is we are now doing something about it.<\/p><p>It is important that these improvements are planned and undertaken in a cost-effective manner and in line with the community-based model of care.  This will be the focus of the use of significant additional ongoing funds provided to these services in 2016.  The Supplementary Estimate also provides for pay cost pressures in respect of overnight residential staff in the disability sector.<\/p><p> Pension costs including pension lump sums require an additional &euro;52 million.  The scale and number of retirements in any financial period is difficult to predict with certainty and, in line with some other Departments with large numbers of staff, additional funding is required in 2015 to meet the pension entitlements of those retiring.  In the main, these are front-line and clinical staff.<\/p><p> Payments are made by the HSE to the State Claims Agency for clinical indemnity, public liability and other awards and settlements.  An additional requirement of &euro;93 million is estimated for 2015.  It is difficult to predict the exact expenditure in any one year as this is dependent on the number and severity of claims, particularly the number of high cost catastrophic birth injury claims.  Another critical variable in projecting the cost is the uncertainty regarding whether these high value claims will be awarded lump sum payments by the courts, or whether they will be awarded a deferred periodic payment award pending the introduction of periodic payment orders on a statutory basis.  I expect legislation to be enacted early next year to provide a statutory basis for periodic payment orders, whereby a court may decide that catastrophically injured people can receive the cost of future care in the form of annual payments instead of a lump sum award.  If this legislation is enacted and works we may have an underspend in State claims next year, but we are not projecting for that.<\/p><p> The Government approved the independent symphysiotomy payment scheme and the scheme commenced in November 2014.  It provides awards to women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.  It was estimated that approximately 350 women would be eligible to apply.  In the event, 578 applications have been accepted by the scheme.  There are approximately 140 applications still to be assessed.  The scheme will conclude as soon as possible in 2016.<\/p><p> In 2012 the Medical Defence Union made a settlement with the State in respect of outstanding past liabilities relating to indemnity cover for medical consultants.  Work is under way to delegate responsibility for managing these claims to the State Claims Agency.  Pending completion of this work, payment of these claims must be made by my Department.  It is estimated that &euro;16 million of the Supplementary Estimate requirement will be sufficient to address these areas.<\/p><p> As Deputies may be aware, &euro;131 million of once-off cash receipts from health insurers were built into the 2015 budgetary arithmetic.  The HSE and VHI have now agreed terms which commit the HSE and VHI to work towards finalising a claims and payment arrangement and allows for an initial payment of more than &euro;100 million before the end of 2015.  This represents a substantial portion of outstanding private patient charges.  I welcome the progress made in this area by the HSE, with the support of my Department and the VHI.  Discussions are continuing between the HSE and other health insurers and I hope that these can also conclude positively and with agreement.<\/p><p> While I acknowledge that the extra funding being requested through this Supplementary Estimate is substantial, I am convinced that it facilitates much needed improvements in our health services.  This additional funding, combined with the 2016 budget provision, will see us continue to use the fruits of economic growth to restore funding to our health service.  In doing so we are maintaining and adapting existing levels of services and introducing enhancements in some priority areas.  The above items, together with cash projections to year end, involve a gross requirement of &euro;665 million.  The total Supplementary Estimate request reduces to an Exchequer requirement of &euro;600 million following the receipt of an additional payment under the UK-Ireland Reimbursement Agreement.  In conclusion, I seek the committee's approval of the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 38.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#B00800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  We are in the invidious position of short timescales for advancement of information and looking at the principle of Supplementary Estimates in the no-change policy areas.  We accept there have to be Supplementary Estimates.  However, year in and year out we have notifications of a Supplementary Estimate, knowing well in advance that there has to be a requirement for a Supplementary Estimate simply because there was inadequate planning, forecasting and demographic proofing.  That all flows from the inability of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to actually assess what it needs for the year ahead, and put a figure on it.  The Department and the HSE is incapable of doing it and this has not changed in recent times, in fact it has become progressively worse.  The figure of &euro;665 million, some of which I know has been because of changes in policies, is still a significant Supplementary Estimate considering that some of the policy decisions announced in 2014 that would have had an effect could have been factored into the 2015 figures also.  <\/p> <p>  We have not progressed in accountability either.  The Department of Health, the  Minister, senior officials and the HSE at senior management level are incapable of actually managing a budget.  It is a harsh thing to have to say but that is the simple fact of it.  It has been chaotic at times.  I understand the need for Ministers to flex muscles at times or to try to get a headline in the newspapers.  We have seen the previous Minister for Health trying to face down the cuts that were forced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, behind all that and when one strips it away there is a chaotic system - which is an oxymoron I suppose.  It is an issue which must be addressed because, fundamentally, if we are serious about delivering health care and services for people under the obligation of the State to provide public health services, there needs to be a foundation and a base upon which the year ahead can be planned.<\/p> <p>  The question must be asked whether the Minister holds back on always having a Supplementary Estimate because he knows full well the HSE is incapable of managing its budget itself.  If that is the case it is a damning indictment of the HSE.  Does the HSE always know there will be pressure on at the end of the year and that a Supplementary Estimate will come in anyway so there is no real inclination or obligation to make an effort to maintain the services within budget? It is probably a little bit of all of the above.  When one does not have certainty, security or a defined plan to implement health services then one gets panicked situations at the end of the year.  It happens time in and time out in the provision of health care.  With the Supplementary Estimate some procedures can be ramped up while other services are cut in order to try staying within budget.  It all seems to be chaotic.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talks about the potential privatisation of hospital trusts in the years ahead, or at least farming out the management of hospital trusts or groups to private companies.  Is the Minister concerned about the consistent, major overspend in our acute hospitals as currently constituted?  Is there an incentive for acute hospitals to overspend on a continuous basis knowing that when the trolleys are out as far as the car park, the ambulances are backed up and patients are unable to discharge, the political pressure comes on and all of a sudden extra money is allocated at the end of the year under a Supplementary Estimate?  Old habits seem to not have gone away on the Minister's watch.  Perhaps he could elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made announcements on increases such as the &euro;74 million for emergency department overcrowding and late discharges and &euro;25 million for the fair deal scheme.  That was indicated to him as far back as July 2014 when, on taking up his position, the Minister was briefed that delayed discharges were going to have a major impact on health care in terms of freeing up additional beds, moving patients from emergency departments into the hospital proper and moving people out of hospitals into step-down facilities in the community, nursing homes and home care packages.<\/p><p>It seemed there was a very long and lethargic effort to address that obvious challenge facing the health services in general.  I acknowledge matters are moving along much better in the accessing of nursing home care.  Clearly, much work needs to be done on the community care area, home package supports and so on.<\/p><p> With regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, I note the Minister stated that, \"Funding of &euro;51 million was provided to ensure that these massive waiting times would be achieved .... across the public voluntary hospitals ... [and] outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available.\"  He abolished the National Treatment Purchase Fund and set up a special delivery unit but who procures the extra capacity?  Is it the National Treatment Purchase Fund and, if it is, why do we not say that?  Why are we pretending that the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been castrated and is now effectively unable to do what it was meant to do?  We should try to bring it to the fore again to deal with the capacity issues.  We all accept there are difficulties with capacity in the public health system.  That is the reason we have seen major increases until recently in the number of outpatient, inpatient, day-case and other elective procedures.  If there is a capacity issue in the public hospital system, admitting it would help and the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be reintroduced to provide and procure private capacity to deal with the backlogs.  I cannot understand why we seem to be pretending that we do not outsource when we are outsourcing, which effectively means purchasing from the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#D00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I disagree with Deputy Kelleher in lumping the HSE in with the Minister, the Department of Health and the Government on the issue of the assessment of need and the capacity to operate within budgets.  As I well recall it, the HSE sought substantially more than was afforded to it for funding for the service plan for 2015.  Its assessment was more in line with the reality of this year and the additional provision being provided under the Supplementary Estimate before us.  It was the Minister and the Government who failed to provide the required funding.  On the reference to HSE's incapacity to operate within budget, again I believe Deputy Kelleher is wrong about that.  I believe it has the capacity but with under-resourcing, underprovision and a fault line in regard to accurate forecasting of the potential presentation of footfall, it would have found itself in a very difficult, if not an impossible, situation over the course of this year and that manifested itself on a number of occasions.  The bottom line in regard to all of that is underprovision and insufficient resourcing with the result that it had neither the human resources nor the physical wherewithal to cope within reasonable timeframes.<\/p> <p>  I would make a number of points in response to the Minister's opening remarks.  The &euro;600 million he is seeking now is &euro;65 million less than has been adjudged required to bring us up to the end of this month.  Can he clarify for the record if the &euro;65 million additional payment in respect of the so-called UK-Ireland bilateral health care reimbursement agreement has been received?  It is important to note that he referenced in his remarks the difficulty there has been historically in having private health insurers provide payment for specific service provision and that he is now seeing a &euro;100 million initial payment.  Is that an upfront payment?  There was not necessarily a correlation but a joint difficulty of taking the money from the health insurer entities and in regard to the British arrangement.  Is this money promised or has it been received?  <\/p> <p>  When the Minister talks about addressing the areas of unmet need, he is again confirming the situation, to which that I have alluded, with respect to the HSE.  This is unmet need and it is unmet most certainly because of under-resourcing and undercapacity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a number of other brief points.  On the emphasis on reduced delayed discharges, reduced waiting lists and reducing emergency department overcrowding, these are the areas of critical concentration in dealing with the issues in the hear and now which I believe will continue to be the areas of critical concentration.  It is important that everything is done to address these matters as quickly as possible.  The Minister stated that he cannot introduce all the capacity required over night but that he has responses in train that could be introduced relatively quickly.  Will he elaborate on the specific set of measures he hopes will be in put place now and towards the end of this month to get us through this last period of 2015?  Has there been an uptake in terms of nurse recruitment?  Apart from the winter months initiative in regard to the additional 300 beds, are other bed capacities being created that would add to that much needed resource to deal with the numbers presenting, which is expected to continue to rise.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of points to be welcomed and it would be wrong of me not to do so.  We have seen a significant reduction in the delayed discharges from 850 to 558 as of the beginning of this month.  The delivery of that improvement will compliment the additional bed capacity but there is no reason to be complacent.  Delayed discharges are indicative of underprovision with respect to future care needs, either in terms of home care packages or residential long-term care provision.  It is important we recognise that this needs to be part of any package of measures to address this particular vexed difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister stated that at the start of the year, he put in place maximum permissible times for inpatient and day-case treatment and outpatient appointments but, in fact, what he actually did is not what he said he did.  He actually extended the maximum permissible waiting times in each of these areas up to 18 months.  That is something that needs to be revisited.  Eighteen months in that respect is unacceptable.  We heard voices on his side previously, either in this committee or in the D&aacute;il Chamber, which were hugely critical of much shorter waiting times across inpatient and outpatient need, including day-case treatment, and yet we have permissible waiting times now of up to 18 months and 15 months by the year end.  What is current position on that?<\/p> <p> The number of people waiting for outpatient appointments has fallen below 386,000.  We should reflect on that number for a moment - there is no reason for celebration in this matter.<\/p><p>We have a huge job of work to do and I emphasise \"we\" because it is critically important that these matters are addressed comprehensively across the board.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a brief comment on the nine hour wait on trolleys and the Minister's recent indication of a penalty on hospitals that exceed nine hours.  That is the wrong way to go about the matter.  It is not about penalising those who fail to realise a timeframe regarding trolley use for patients.  Those hospitals may well be the hospitals that need even more support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#E00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I propose to move on to the subheads of the Estimates and we will go through individual subheads on the Vote.

It is a scientific fact that in those cases cerebral palsy is not caused by negligence, it is because of something that happened in the womb.  That is essentially what this boils down to.  The no-fault way would be a better way to do this by saying: \"A child with cerebral palsy needs support. Whether it was a natural occurrence or medical negligence is not the point, let us just look after all these children.\"  This requires a total change of policy and a significant increase in costs because one would then be treating equally those who could prove medical negligence and those who cannot.  It would mean that in cases of cerebral palsy occurring for natural reasons - which is usually the cause - those children should get whatever supports they need anyway.

This is particularly important in rural areas and areas where there is a single-handed practice.  Some hospital groups where it is known that consultants will retire have started to make what are known as proleptic appointments.  This was already done to some extent.  It means that if it is known someone will retire in three, four or five years, the post may be given to a registrar, for example, who is heading off to America.  This proleptic appointment means the job is available should the registrar wish to return.  We could do much better on succession planning than has been done to date.

My apologies, I cannot say which subhead it comes under.  I must give the Deputy an Alice in Wonderland answer.  Once upon a time, when I was a senior house officer in St. James's Hospital, I used to get a pay cheque from what was known as the Western Area Heath Board, an entity that no longer existed at that time.  Similarly, the regions referred to here no longer exist.  We have moved away from regions to hospital groups, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted, and community health care organisations, CHOs.  A range of national services are also in place, including the national cancer control programme and the health and well-being programme, under which BreastCheck would fall.  As such, accounting continues be based on regions that no longer exist.<\/p><p>Beneath it, the health boards still exist on a financial basis.  While we have national services such as the National Ambulance Service, for payroll purposes the ancient health boards still exist.  A major financial reform is required in the health system to align how the accounts work with how the service is configured.  This is a big job that must be done over the coming years and it requires a big IT investment.<\/p><p> There is no logical basis for funding across regions.  It will happen for the hospitals with activity-based funding.  Generally, people in health are funded on a historical basis.  They receive the allocation they received the previous year, plus or minus an certain amount.  This is not the way to do it.  Hospitals will move to activity-based funding whereby they will be paid for the work they do and the procedures they carry out.  Similarly, for the community health organisations there will be an assessment of population need.  Beyond this are the national programmes.  The HSE Dublin north east region includes the Mater hospital, which could be providing cardiology and cardiothoracic services to the entire country.  It also includes Beaumont Hospital, which could provide neurosurgery for the entire country, other than Cork.<\/p><p> It will never be straightforward.  Although the old legacy regions no longer exist, they are still used for accountancy purposes, and it has not changed much.  Even after the HSE was established ten or 11 years ago, the health boards were never abolished.  It is Byzantine, and will take more than the months remaining to me as Minister to sort it out.  It is very hard to justify spending tens of millions of euro on new financial systems and be told one is wasting money on IT systems and accountants when one should be spending it on front-line services.

The private sector has had to bring its buildings up to standard more quickly than public institutions.  The private sector thinks that is unfair and I can understand where it is coming from.  While the private sector has had to meet the highest building standards quicker than the public sector, in the real world we would not have anywhere for the older people to go if we started closing all those old nursing homes and district hospitals around the country.  That was just not a viable option.  Perhaps there is an element of unfairness but the legislation acknowledges that HIQA must have regard to the HSE's resources.

Those talks will begin in the new year.  They will be led by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Procurement Service.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor also asked about the decision to extend the scheme of GP care without fees.  In the end, after a great deal of consideration and legal advice, we decided to extend it in the first instance to children under the age of six and people over the age of 70 because people in those groups are most likely to need to see a doctor.  We thought it was particularly important to make this provision in respect of children under the age of six, because children are most likely to need to see a doctor at that age.  Illnesses and issues like obesity can be picked up at a very early stage.  At the time of making this decision, those whose children were most unlikely to have medical cards or doctor visit cards were working parents.  I know that a small number of people in this category were very wealthy but many of them really had to think long and hard about the &euro;50 required to see a doctor.  If this is done on its own, it will all be for nothing.  It was only ever a first step.  This involved starting with the oldest and the youngest.  We want the next steps to include all children because it is my strong view - I know this is not shared by everyone or by every party - that children should not be means tested on the basis of their parents' incomes.  We do not do it for education.  We do not charge people for primary or secondary education because their parents earn more than &euro;50,000 or whatever.  We do not do it for the early childhood education year.  We do not means-test child benefit.  The only thing we means-test in Ireland, when it comes to children, is health care.  Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does this.  It is a total anomaly.  I do not think we should do it.  Ireland is an oddity in Europe in so far as it does this.  Health is an oddity in Ireland in so far as this is done in the health area.  I think it is really unfair because working parents who get up early in the morning to go out to work lose out yet again as a result of the means testing of their kids.  I do not think that is fair.  This is just the first step in the process of redressing all of that.  Notwithstanding the health care benefits of this approach, there is a social justice element to it too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#K00600","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Provision of &euro;10 million is made in the budget for 2016 for the roll-out of access to free GP care to those between the ages of six and 12.

The provisions and anticipated costs for the roll-out of free GP care in the coming year are outlined in the documentation we have been given.  This is really an issue of access to health care, which has been narrowly defined by the Minister as access to GPs.  Of course, there is means testing on a continual basis for medical cards.  Unless I am reading it wrong, children are getting GP visit cards, in effect.  That is why people have contrary views about how universal health care might be advanced.  Many people are saying that someone who receives domiciliary care allowance, for example, should get a medical card.  It would be straightforward.  If someone meets the terms of the means test for the domiciliary care allowance, why not give him or her a medical card?  In such circumstances, at least medical cards would be targeted at those who are most in need of them.  While it is fine to give GP cards to kids under the age of six, the reality is that means testing for medical cards is continuing.  I have yet to find a medical card that is not means tested.  That is the grave difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I am getting going on this.  While there have been improvements in facilitating medical cards on a discretionary basis, in many cases it is still like pulling teeth to a certain extent.  I know there has been a major increase of approximately 95,000 in the number of discretionary medical cards in the system.  That dramatic increase has resulted from a change in policy.  The policy that was reversed was denied for 18 months before this policy change took place.  I think we need to look at this entire area.  The Minister speaks about universal health care and everything that flows from it but I think the policy of rolling out free GP services to the whole nation at a time when people in any age cohort who are already in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are being asked to undergo a means test when applying for a medical card should be looked at very quickly.  It makes sense to look at it.  I am no expert in this area but I suggest that when the social welfare and health codes intermesh in places like this, one means test should be sufficient for the awarding of the medical card.  My view is that such an approach would cut out a great deal of red tape.  I think it is something the Minister should look at as a means of advancing universal health care, as opposed to universal access to a GP which is fundamentally not the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#K00800","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I reiterate that if the extension of these cards to those under the age of six and over the age of 70 is the only thing we do, it will not be worth doing.  It was never intended to be anything other than a first step.  One of the first steps towards universal health care in Ireland was taken in the late 1940s and 1950s, when efforts were made to introduce the mother and child scheme.  It is a pity is stopped there.  The same arguments were made at the time against the mother and child scheme, which was originally proposed by Dr. No&euml;l Browne and, in fairness, was actually brought in by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Dr. Browne did not manage to bring it in.  It was brought in by the subsequent Fianna F&aacute;il Government and it all stopped there.  It is a pity we did not do something like that every three or four years.<\/p><p>Had that been done, we would have universal health care by now.  What needs to be done as part of the roll-out of universal health care is not just the roll-out to six to 12 year olds and then twelve to 18 year olds; it is a new medicines reimbursement scheme.  The current scheme is Byzantine and unfair.  There is the long-term illness scheme, under which some people pay nothing, no matter how wealthy they are; a medical card scheme under which people, some of whom are extremely poor, pay up to &euro;25; and then there is the drugs payment scheme for everyone else, which is based on a monthly payment.  It is not a good system.  In a few weeks' time, Members will see proposals in my party's manifesto as to how we might resolve all of that, or at least come up with a fairer scheme.  That would be the medicines element of it.  The Deputy is right to say that the &euro;10 million is there because it is anticipated that we could bring in the next step - GP care without fees for children aged six to ten - starting in Q4.  However, we have always made it very clear that we would not impose this on the GPs ahead of an agreement on a new contract, so it will not be a standalone contract in the way the under-sixes contract was.  It would form part of the new contract that we hope to agree with the IMO, which I imagine will include things other than the roll-out to six to 12 year olds.  It will include supports for rural practice and urban deprived areas, chronic disease management and other measures.

All of those things.  That is one of the things being discussed now.  I would like to have that agreed as soon as possible and then be able to commit to its implementation in the programme for Government, but my concern is that we will not be able to agree the contract until after the new Government is formed, and then we have to go looking for the money for it.  That is not ideal, but that is where we are.<\/p> <p>  On children with a diagnosis of cancer, that decision was made by the director general on the advice of the clinical advisory group, which now advises on the guidelines for the discretionary medical cards.  That whole area is fraught.  Nobody has the right answers when it comes to the guidelines for discretionary medical cards, which is why we need to keep changing them and updating them.  The whole issue of using the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, as a proxy for medical card eligibility was considered by the clinical advisory group.  On the face of it, I thought it was a good idea.  Maybe it is still a good idea.  I would not rule out doing it, but the view I came to was that it was not a good proxy for eligibility for a medical card because many people who receive DCA have a disability, but that does not necessarily mean they have high medical needs or considerable medical costs.  One will come across people with disabilities who will say they are not looking for a medical card - that they would like to have one, but they would prefer more educational supports or more supports around employment.  That is the dilemma.  Members will know themselves.  They will know people who have a disability but do not have to see their doctors a great deal and are not on any medications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>They are not drawing the medical card then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>The GP would still get the fee, even if they never attended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I would not rule it out, actually.

There are real concerns at a number of sites around the country that, as the Minister acknowledged in earlier commentary, because of the age profile of many of the buildings in use, which were not purpose-built for their current usage, significant works are required.  HIQA reports are valid and are reflective of the fact that these buildings are not of the standard required today and that they need to be significantly enhanced or replaced.<\/p> <p>  I was due to meet with representatives of St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon yesterday evening, although the floods, unfortunately, made that unachievable.  That is just one example of a community that has a huge dependence on such a facility.  It is dependent on it not only for the critical function of providing nursing home and long-term care needs for people within the community - some 85 people in that reduced-capacity building - but also a whole range of ancillary services provided there, extending from Sligo Regional Hospital, which are very important to the dependent catchment area.  What can the Minister tell us about a capital plan that will give some hope and comfort to people in that community, for example, which is not in my own constituency, that they are not facing further downgrading and contraction and can look forward to a replacement construction on the site of the existing facility or utilising the wider campus area to provide a much-needed new facility?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I am going back to the private nursing homes.

Again, really good work is done there, but they are finding it very hard to keep nurses.<\/p> <p>  Finally, two separate sets of four parents who have adult sons and daughters in the 40s and 50s have come to my constituency office recently.  These parents are getting older and they are very worried.  They are looking after their children, who have a disability, at the moment, but they are very worried about what will happen in the future.  These adults are able to live independently with a little support.  They are all on the housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the parents feel that, for example, they could come together and live independently in one home.  At the moment, the HSE in Bray is saying it has no money for this, but could we look at a policy in the future whereby accommodation for people with disabilities does not always have to be residential, in a home.  Some people can live independently, but they need supports from the HSE and the local authority.  Instead of giving four houses, in this case, they would be funding one house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01400","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Approximately &euro;330 million was spent between 2009 and 2014 on replacing and upgrading some of these community nursing units, district hospitals and so on.<\/p><p>The facility I am most familiar with in my constituency is St. Mary's Hospital in the park, which has now been replaced by a fabulous community nursing unit.  An additional &euro;200 million is to be spent in the coming years upgrading or replacing some of the existing facilities.  There is also a public private partnership bundle as well.<\/p><p> Priority will be given to those which are least HIQA compliant, if that makes any sense.  HIQA will have expressed views on all of these facilities.  Some are more in need of being replaced than others.  The intention is to keep all of them open as much as possible until they are replaced or refurbished, for all sorts of obvious reasons.<\/p><p> I do not have a timeframe on any of them at the moment.  Certainly a facility such as St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon has to be done.  Again, I would rather not put a date on it because I do not want to be held to something that I cannot be sure of, but certainly it would have to be fully done, built and occupied by 2021.  The question of how it will be done has not yet been determined.  My best guess is that it will be done as part of a PPP.  In that case a total rebuild is probably required.  The existing facility probably cannot be refurbished.  In other words, we would have to rebuild next to it in the way the new community nursing unit was developed beside St. Mary's Hospital in the park.  Similar designs will probably be built throughout the country.  They will probably be done as a bundle of community nursing units similar to the bundles of schools or primary care centres that Deputies will be familiar with.  It is difficult to put an exact timeframe on it.  We hope it will be done as soon as possible.  However, it has to go through planning, design and so on.  It is difficult to put a timeframe on these things.<\/p><p> Nursing recruitment is a real struggle.  Everyone is recruiting at the moment, not only nursing homes but private and public hospitals as well.  Everyone is looking for nurses.  The HSE is 750 nurses up on this time last year.  Some of this is accounted for by agency conversion but most of it is a result of new extra nurses.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland is getting better at speeding up the applications.  Often there are problems with paperwork and so on.  A particularly encouraging development this year is the effort being made to retain the graduating class of this year.  I was in Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, where 16 of the 18 trainee nurses are staying.  The other two are going to Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#L01500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>They are very welcome in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015120800002#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449590400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I hope they went to Cork University Hospital and not the Bons Secours Hospital.

However, the general backdrop is an international shortage of nurses.  The reason Irish nurses are in Canada and the Middle East and the reason Filipino nurses are in Ireland is because there is an international shortage.  There is no surplus of nurses in the world.  We are all begging from each other.  Moreover, for a period during the recession we were not creating posts.  We lost many people during that period.  It will be difficult to get them back because many of them have settled elsewhere.  Anyway, we are doing well with the graduating classes.  I believe we need to make a particular effort to keep them in Ireland and give them career and educational opportunities to encourage them to stay.<\/p> <p>  Certain nurses like particular types work.  Older care is a particular type of work.  It is very different to theatre or ICU nursing.  The NMBI has tried to speed up the whole process around registering nurses from overseas.<\/p> <p>  Another point we touched on was the need to provide more community houses.  The policy is not to put people in institutions or homes anymore and to de-congregate.  The idea is to have many more people with disabilities and special needs in houses in normal housing estates with everyone else, perhaps with two or three people in each house.  We know this happens and there are many examples in our constituencies.<\/p> <p>  The demands and the needs are vast.  A sizeable number of people are still in institutional settings, for example, in &Aacute;ras Attracta and other settings.  We are keen to get them out into houses in the community.  Many people are at home too.  There may be adults in their 40s and 50s with parents in their 60s and 70s - Deputy Mitchell O'Connor referred to such cases.  These parents are concerned about what will happen.  We should be providing more of these houses than at present, frankly.  The money simply was not available during the recession years.  I know that in Dublin West the Daughters of Charity opened a new house almost every year up until 2008 and then did not open any for six or seven years because of the recession.  The result is that we have pent-up demand that needs to be relieved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is in discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, because this is partially a housing matter and partially a health matter.  They need to agree something.
