The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.

I understand that large numbers of individuals were seeking to settle their NPPR liability in the days leading up to 31 August and not all could get through to their local authority, due to the high volume of calls. The Local Government Management Agency, on behalf of the local authorities, has confirmed, in recognition of this, that individuals who made contact with either the National Bureau or with their local authority before the expiry of the deadline indicating the property for which they wanted to settle the NPPR liability and giving their contact details, could have penalties frozen at 31 August 2014 levels.<br\/><br\/>If such contact was not made or if payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.

In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier. The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website at .<br\/><br\/>The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the CER in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted. Neither hard water nor the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium, require the restriction of a supply.<br\/><br\/>The CER recently held a public consultation on the Water Charges Plan submitted to it by Irish Water. This consultation covered a range of issues relating to water charges including the approach to charging where water quality issues arise. T he CER is currently reviewing submissions r eceived on the consultation and will make a final determination lat er this month. Full details of the CER public consultation are available on .<br\/><br\/>The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700050#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Costs and Controls","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700050#WRA04650"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[34301\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700050#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 381 of 10 June 2014, if the report into the private rented sector to be carried out by the Private Residential Tenancies Board has now been completed; the main findings of the report; his views on introducing some form of regulation to control rent levels in private rented accommodation, particularly in Dublin where there is an acute shortage of private rented housing stock.","asker":"1190","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>The private rented sector is an increasingly important element of the housing market, with the proportion of households in the sector almost doubling in the period 2006-2011. I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. The most recent published data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index shows the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin where rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually, while for apartments the figure was 10.3%.<br\/><br\/>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and earlier this year the Government published <i>Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector<\/i>. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.

It is a major report that will require careful consideration, together with colleagues in Government, before deciding on the best options to address the current difficulties in the market.

Local authorities&rsquo; cost and income bases vary significantly from one another as a result of their size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants has been complex. <br\/><br\/>There are significant variances between local authorities in all areas of operation, service provision, income generation and service demand, some of which is geographically driven and influenced and is subject to fluidity and uncertainty, particularly in the last 5 years.  In these circumstances, a strict formulaic approach to General Purpose Grant allocations would have limitations.  In determining these grants a number of factors were taken into account as relevant, including the overall funding available for local authorities, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of service to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.  Each local authority&rsquo;s financial position is kept under ongoing review by my Department, through gathering data and meeting local authority personnel, where necessary; local authorities&rsquo; annual and multi-annual financial performance and projections, where available, along with any other relevant information would also have been considered as part of the process of allocating General Purpose Grants.<br\/><br\/>In 2014 the establishment of Irish Water presented local government with significant organisational and financial challenges.  Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes impacted directly on the funding model for local authorities, with General Purpose Grants in 2014 reflecting the move of the funding source from my Department to Irish Water; the levels of General Purpose Grants received in 2014 are, therefore, not comparable to previous years&rsquo; allocations. <br\/><br\/>In 2015, in addition to the changes in water services funding, local authorities will be faced with further changes to their funding model as a result of the move to local retention and variation of Local Property Tax (LPT.  The Government has decided that 80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015.  The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide additional funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.  This additional funding will be allocated to ensure that no local authority receives less income from LPT in 2015 than they received from the General Purpose Grants in 2014. <br\/><br\/>Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will however receive additional income in 2015 from LPT compared to their 2014 General Purpose Grant.  The Government has decided that these local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding.  The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in their respective areas (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount.  It will be a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend that discretionary funding. <br\/><br\/>I have advised local authorities of their individual provisional LPT allocations for 2015.  This information has been provided at this early stage in the budget process for 2015 in order to ensure that local authorities have sufficient detail available to inform their decision-making in respect of LPT rate variation for 2015, which must be completed and notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Expenditure","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[33043\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the aggregate annual costs and cost per household from 2008 to 2013 to the Exchequer of the various rent allowance and rent supplement schemes.

Its purpose is to examine the internal controls in place to guard against the risks associated with the activities and to provide assurance to management.  Following an audit, Internal Audit reports are generated for management and outline issues and make recommendations if applicable for improving any deficiencies or shortfalls.  The reports are internal documents circulated to senior management and the relevant business areas to assist in obtaining assurance and in addressing issues arising.  <br\/><br\/>A new Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 was introduced earlier this year, building on the approach and progress made under the Fraud Initiative (2011&ndash;2013), and redundancy debt is pursued under this overall Departmental policy. <br\/><br\/>To support and enhance its debt recovery approach, the Department is also in the process of replacing its current debt management system in order to deliver a more modernised and automated approach to the recording, accounting and recovery of all debts outstanding.  The new system will be operational in the last quarter of 2014.  Redundancy and Insolvency Sections will be using this system as part of their debt recovery strategy.<br\/><br\/>Where a company is continuing to trade, the Department actively engages with such employers in order to maximise the recovery of debt.  Full recovery of the debt is sought and where appropriate, the Department agrees a debt recovery plan with employers which can include payment by instalment.<br\/><br\/>Where a company has gone into liquidation, the Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of the employer.<br\/><br\/>Redundancy payments, are made to firms which are in financial difficulty, therefore, a very significant amount of this debt will not be recoverable.<br\/><br\/>Since 2011 the Department has introduced a much more rigorous and detailed examination of claims submitted.  This includes cross checking wage figures against the P45\/P35 returns and double checking for breaks in service, periods in receipt of social welfare payments etc.  This detailed examination of claims ensures that the correct level of redundancy payment is made in each case.<br\/><br\/>Where employers default in making redundancy lump sums, the full statutory entitlement may be made to employees from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  In addition where employers become insolvent, certain other outstanding statutory entitlements (arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) may also be paid from SIF.  Amounts paid under these circumstances are recoverable from employers.  However the level of recoveries cannot be accurately estimated and the amount recoverable is recognised as a contingent<b><\/b>asset of the SIF.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with recognised accounting practice (International Accounting Standard 37 refers) a contingent asset is not recognised in the balance sheet of the SIF but is disclosed by way of note to its annual statutory account.  The annual statutory account of the SIF which is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General records full details by way of note of Redundancy and Insolvency amounts paid, recovered, written off and outstanding, recoveries are brought to account on a cash receipt basis.  The book value of the amount recoverable in respect of Redundancy and Insolvency at 31 December 2013 is &euro;460,498,000. <br\/><br\/>Expenditure on the redundancy and insolvency payments schemes from 2011 to the end of August 2014 and debt recovery details for the period 2011 to June 2014 are set out in the following tables. <br\/><br\/><b>Expenditure on Statutory Redundancy Payments<\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Rebates to Employers (&euro; million)<\/th><th>Lump sums to employees (&euro; million)<\/th><th>Total (&euro; million)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Jan to Aug (Provisional)<\/td><td>49.28<\/td><td>92.3<\/td><td>141.58<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>49.5<\/td><td>76.6<\/td><td>126.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>167.4<\/td><td>134.3<\/td><td>301.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>185.3<\/td><td>126.7<\/td><td>311.96<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Expenditure\u00a0 on Statutory Insolvency Payments Scheme (&euro; million)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014 Jan to Aug (Provisional)<\/td><td>24.48<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>22.047<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>21.664<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>18.510<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>Redundancy and Insolvency Payments Schemes -<\/b><b>Payments and Recoveries 2011 to June 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>Debt<\/th><th>2011 &euro;m<\/th><th>2012 &euro;m<\/th><th>2013 &euro;m<\/th><th>2014 to end June &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Redundancy Payments Scheme<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Payments (debt incurred)<\/td><td>68.6<\/td><td>95.6<\/td><td>110.7<\/td><td>29.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Recoveries <\/td><td>3.7<\/td><td>4.09<\/td><td>5.2<\/td><td>6.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insolvency Payments Scheme<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Payments (debt incurred)<\/td><td>18.5<\/td><td>21.7<\/td><td>22.05<\/td><td>11.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Recoveries<\/td><td>0.8<\/td><td>1.8<\/td><td>1.8<\/td><td>1.9<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 50.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[32912\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when rent support, including arrears, will be approved in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

An independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of former interns moved into employment within 5 or more months of finishing their internship.<br\/><br\/>The Department pays each JobBridge intern a &euro;50 per week top up in addition to their Social Welfare payment to take account of the additional &lsquo;out of pocket&rsquo; expenses that may be incurred in undertaking an internship.  Springboard is operated by the Higher Education Authority under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.<br\/><br\/>Host organisations are not permitted to displace an employee with a JobBridge intern.  Host organisations must undertake to provide a high quality real workplace internship experience for an intern for at least 30 hours per week.  A robust monitoring system is in place to ensure that all internships under the JobBridge scheme are fully compliant.  If the Deputy has specific details of displacement or other abuse of JobBridge to give to the Department, the matter will be fully investigated.<br\/><br\/>Internship opportunities, including SNAs, are advertised by the host organisation, in this case schools, at their discretion.  When advertising internship opportunities host organisations undertake to comply with the stringent criteria that the Department applies for the protection of the intern and the integrity JobBridge scheme.  In addition to these requirements, host organisations must also be mindful of the requirements within their own Sector or governing authority.  The Department has ongoing liaison with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the operation of JobBridge in the Education Sector.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the initial vetting of advertisements and the requirement for the host organisation to participate in monthly compliance reporting, the Department has, as outlined, on-going monitoring of internships; this includes the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  The strict requirements for mentoring also apply to internships within the Education Sector.  <br\/><br\/>If an intern does not receive an offer of employment at the end of an internship they are required to notify their local Social Welfare office and sign back onto the Live Register.  Interns are not permitted to undertake a second internship with the same host organisation.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1.

","asker":"1100","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>PRSI credited contributions (\"credits\") are an integral part of the social insurance system.  For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.   <\/p><p>  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment - he or she must have paid at least one PRSI contribution as an employed contributor.  Subsequently, insured workers may be awarded credits if they claim a social welfare payment because they are out of work, or they are ill or incapacitated, or if they are engaged in certain training or educational courses.  If at any stage in their working life, a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  Statistics are not collected in respect of the number of persons who do not qualify for credits.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Live Register it should be noted that the register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Unemployment is measured officially by the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey.  A person is unemployed if, in the week before the survey, they were without work and available for work within the next 2 weeks. <\/p><p>  Persons in receipt of qualifying social welfare payments have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.

The obligation imposed on an employer and on scheme members is normally agreed and set out in the trust deed and rules of each scheme.  The trust deeds and rules differ from scheme to scheme and reflect the parameters on the level of obligation of the parties involved.   <\/p><p>  The Pensions Act imposes a requirement on the trustees of a defined benefit scheme to maintain sufficient assets in a scheme to meet the liabilities of a scheme.  This is often referred to as the funding standard.  The funding standard provides a benchmark against which the &quot;health&quot; of a scheme can be tested.  When a scheme fails the funding standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay the benefits promised.  The existence of the funding standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.   <\/p><p>  A number of both administrative and legislative changes have been made in recent years to assist both employers and the trustees of pension scheme address the funding difficulties facing many schemes at this time.  <\/p><p>  In 2012, I amended the Pensions Act to require the trustees of pension schemes to maintain a additional level of funding in the form of a risk reserve to protect the interests of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  This requirement will come into effect from 2016.  The trustees of defined benefit pension schemes were required to inform the Pensions Authority of their funding position by June 2013.  The Pensions Authority is working with the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes, particularly schemes in a weak funding position, to help them achieve a sustainable funding position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB06600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB06650"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[33304\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700051#WRB06700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will approve an appeal in respect of an application for disability allowance in respect of a person, details supplied, in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

These reforms were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, and contain provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years for recipients from 2 July, 2015.  This reform aims to bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents in line with other European Union countries.  It also aims to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty by providing them with improved access to education, training, and employment programmes.<\/p><p>  The last phase of the OFP scheme age reductions, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years, will take effect from 2 July, 2015.  It is expected that approximately 36,000 lone parents will be transitioning from their OFP payment on that date &ndash; with the vast majority of them moving to another social welfare income support payment.<\/p><p>  It is expected that most affected lone parents will transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment or to the JA transitional arrangement.  Other lone parents will transition to either the family income supplement (FIS) or a full-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p><p>  The income disregard of the OFP scheme is also being reduced on a phased basis for new and existing recipients of the payment.  The income disregard will be reduced to &euro;75 per week in January, 2015, and to &euro;60 per week in January, 2016.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about the state pension (contributory), the gradual increase in the state pension age to 68 years was legislated for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011.  In January, 2014, the state pension age was standardised at 66 years with the cessation of the state pension (transition).  The state pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.<\/p><p>  Currently, a person&rsquo;s date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes.  To qualify for a state pension, a person must:<\/p><p>  - have entered insurance before the age of 66 years;<\/p><p>  - have at least 520 paid PRSI contributions; and<\/p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average (i.e. a yearly average of 48 PRSI contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a full-rate pension). <\/p><p>  The main social welfare payment that is available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB).  People who qualify for the JB payment who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (i.e. 66 years).  In addition, with effect from 1 January, 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 years or over have been placed on yearly signing and given the option of transferring to EFT payments.  They are not subject to mandatory activation measures, but may avail of employment supports, which will continue to be available to them, and they will not be subject to mandatory activation-related sanctions.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the majority of people who went into receipt of the state pension (transition) did not come from work as most of them were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December, 2012, there were approximately 14,400 state pension (transition) claims in payment and, of those; just 12.5% came from work.  Over 50% came from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and assistance, and invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce, for a variety of reasons, well in advance of state pension age. <\/p><p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need them the most and, where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of a social insurance-based scheme, a means-tested assistance payment may be available to them, provided that they satisfy the necessary qualifying conditions.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. <\/p><p>  A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process.  This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. <\/p><p>  The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy, has recently been circulated. <\/p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, approximately 115 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, initially in Cork County, Limerick City and County and Waterford City and County from 15th   September 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[33333\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she has examined the idea of the development of guidelines by her Department for release to general practitioners and other medical professionals in relation to the preparation of medical reports for inclusion in applications submitted by persons seeking certain social protection payments.","asker":"1190","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>It is the policy of my Department to review application forms for the individual illness related schemes on a regular basis, including those parts of forms that relate to the provision of medical evidence.

With regard to certification for illness benefit, evidence-based &lsquo;Closed Certification&rsquo; guidelines have been developed by the Department&rsquo;s medical team to assist GPs in certifying for appropriate durations for patients with common health problems. These guidelines are based on extensive international research. A recent 6 month research study was conducted involving 128 randomly selected GPs. Responding to a questionnaire survey over 80% of participating GP respondents considered these guidelines; to be helpful in their interactions with patients, resulted in better health outcomes for their patients and that these guidelines should be rolled out nationally. A more detailed statistical evaluation of claim duration is being conducted by the Department which will decide on future plans for roll-out and refinement of &lsquo;Closed Certification&rsquo; based on this research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[33340\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin whose disability allowance and other associated payments have been stopped; and if these allowances might be reinstated.","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>An application for disability allowance was received from the person concerned on 5 July 2013.

Since its introduction in the 1960s, the free travel scheme has been highly valued as it allows beneficiaries to participate and remain active in the community. <br\/><br\/>The appropriate rates of other welfare supports in the year ahead, including payments made to carers, will be considered by Government as part of its deliberations on the next Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC02700"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[33444\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the conditions or criteria required for a person to qualify for credited contributions while in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit; to outline the Government's actions to date to protect long term and older carers in relation to their pension entitlements to ensure that carers are not disadvantaged due to extended periods of caring; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>Credited contributions (credits) are social insurance contributions designed to protect the social insurance entitlement record of insured workers who are not in a position to make PRSI contributions.<br\/><br\/>Credits are awarded in circumstances such as unemployment or illness, and their purpose is to help protect the social insurance entitlements of insured persons during periods when they may not be in a position to pay contributions.<br\/><br\/>In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment - he or she must have paid at least one PRSI at Class A, B, C, D, E, H or P. <br\/><br\/>Credits may enable insured workers to qualify for various social insurance benefits. While the contribution conditions applying to the various insurance benefit schemes can vary, a claimant must, in general, have<br\/><br\/>a.<b>Paid<\/b>a minimum number of weekly contributions<b>and<\/b><br\/><br\/>b.Have a certain number of <b>contributions or credits<\/b>over a specified period; in the case of short-term benefits this is the relevant tax year, while in the case of long-term benefits (e.g. pensions) this is on the basis of the yearly average number of contributions and\/or credits over the person's working life. <br\/><br\/>Credits cannot be used to satisfy condition (a). Thus, credits are only of value to a person who satisfies this &quot;paid contribution&quot; test.<br\/><br\/>Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer's Allowance in the following circumstances:<br\/><br\/>- if the claimant was employed and paid PRSI contributions prior to receiving Carer's Allowance s\/he may be entitled to credits. If, however, there is a gap of two years in the claimant's insurance record, credits are not valid until at least 26 PRSI contributions have been paid<br\/><br\/>- if the claimant was in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance (provided s\/he has at least one paid Class A PRSI contribution) Jobseeker's Benefit or Illness Benefit immediately prior to claiming Carer's Allowance. <br\/><br\/>In addition under the Homemakers Scheme, which was introduced on 6th April 1994, a person who gives up work to take care of a child under age 12 or an incapacitated person over age 12 can be classified as a homemaker. Complete years spent out of the workforce looking after a child or an incapacitated person, are disregarded when working out entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory). However, a person may get credits for the tax year he or she becomes a homemaker and the tax year he or she stops being a homemaker if the period spent as a homemaker is not a complete year. These credits are reckoned only for the purposes of State Pension (contributory).<br\/><br\/>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. This is achieved by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record. <br\/><br\/>The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and\/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. <br\/><br\/>However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.<br\/><br\/>For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available. <br\/><br\/>It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory). The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <br\/><br\/>The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid. This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[33445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to review the habitual residency condition for the carer's allowance given that it acts as a barrier to persons returning to Ireland to care for a loved one.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>The habitual residence condition helps protect Ireland's social welfare system, while at the same time ensuring that those whose claim our schemes  have access to supports  when they need them. <br\/><br\/>Provided the applicant for a carer&rsquo;s allowance is legally resident in the State, a decision on whether the applicant satisfies the conditions in respect of habitual residence is made based on consideration of five factors : <br\/><br\/>1. length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country; <br\/><br\/>2.length and purpose of any absence from the State;<br\/><br\/>3 nature and pattern of person&rsquo;s employment; <br\/><br\/>4 the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest and <br\/><br\/>5. the future intentions of the person concerned .<br\/><br\/>While I have no plans to change the legislation applying to habitual residence and carer&rsquo;s allowance at this time, the Department has, following consultation with carers&rsquo; representative groups, clarified the application of the guidelines with the relevant deciding officers and ensured that deciding officers have access to the most up to date guidelines and receive appropriate training in assessing the habitual residence condition. <br\/><br\/>In this regard, I would point out that less than 120 carer&rsquo;s allowance cases were refused on habitual residence grounds in 2013 - down almost 50% on the 2011 figure of 223.

Of course, there is no conditionality attached to how the RCG is utilised, so carers can use the grant as they wish. <\/p><p>  I should also mention that the RCG, with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other social welfare group nor indeed is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe. <\/p><p>  Expenditure on income supports for carers generally has increased from &euro;773m in 2012 to an estimated &euro;806m in 2014, &euro;557 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;21.5 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;122 million on the respite care grant and &euro;105 on domiciliary care allowance. <\/p><p>  The number of people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance over the past decade has also increased from 23,000 to over 57,000 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Benefits Scheme","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[33450\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700052#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider extending the water allowance payment to all full-time carers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The household benefits package comprises the electricity\/gas allowance (&euro;35 per month) and the free television licence scheme (&euro;160 per annum).

Accordingly, the term family is not used in determining entitlement to weekly social welfare payments, other than in the case of the family income supplement scheme. <\/p><p>  For weekly social welfare payments in general, a claimant is entitled to a personal rate of payment and may also be eligible for increases in respect of a qualified adult and any qualified children who are regarded as normally residing with the claimant.<\/p><p>  A qualified adult is defined as being the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the claimant who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant, but generally does not include a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is in employment or self-employment or who is in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment in his or her own right.  <\/p><p>  In addition, a qualified adult can be a person who is aged 16 years or over, who has the care of at least one qualified child and who lives with and is being wholly maintained by the claimant, where the claimant is single, widowed or separated, for example, an older child who looks after the younger children of a widowed person.<\/p><p>  A qualified child is defined as being a child aged under 18 years or, in the case of recipients of long-term social welfare payments, a child aged under 22 years if the child is still in full-time education.  A qualified child is normally regarded as residing with both of his or her parents for social welfare payment purposes.  However, where the qualified child is living with one parent only or is living on a shared custody basis with both parents who are living apart, there are rules to determine which parent the child is to be regarded as normally residing with for social welfare payment purposes.  These rules also determine who the qualified child is to be regarded as normally residing with where he or she is not living with either parent.<\/p><p>  The term &ldquo;family&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of qualification for the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.  However, as in the case of weekly social welfare payments in general, a family for FIS purposes is not defined by reference to the family relationships involved, but by reference to the composition of the household in which the worker resides and the maintenance relationships between the worker and the members of that household and others. <\/p><p>  A family for FIS purposes means a worker who is engaged in remunerative full-time employment and any children who normally reside with the worker.  Where the worker is living with or is wholly or mainly maintaining his or her spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, then the family for FIS purposes includes that spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.  In addition to including children who reside with the worker, the normal residence rules for FIS purposes also enable a child who is not living with the worker to be regarded as normally residing with him or her where that worker is wholly or mainly maintaining his or her spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and is contributing substantially towards the child&rsquo;s maintenance.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 contains a number of amendments to strengthen and clarify the normal residence rules applying to the FIS scheme.  These amendments are subject to commencement by way of Commencement Order.  It is intended to commence these provisions shortly, as soon as regulations underpinning the normal residence rules applying to the FIS scheme have been finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[33841\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a carer's allowance file will be forwarded to the appeals office in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on the 21<sup>st<\/sup>May 2014.It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought from the Department of Social Protection.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment. <\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Payments","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[33955\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider offering recipients a choice of how they wish to receive the fuel allowance, either in a lump sum or on a weekly basis, in view of the fact that those with oil heating need to make a once off payment to fill a tank, preferably at the beginning of the winter months, which they are generally unable to afford until they have accumulated a number of weekly payments; if this choice is not an option, the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.

The largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2014 is on pensions which will amount to &euro;6.5 billion, or 33% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic change the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year. In 2013, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. <\/p><p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 411,000 customers. <\/p><p>  The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities. The living alone allowance was maintained at &euro;7.70 per week. <\/p><p>  As part of the household benefits package, a new water support payment of &euro;25 every three months, will be introduced in January 2015 at an annual cost of &euro;42 million.  Existing customers in receipt of household benefits will not have to make any additional application to receive the new payment.  The water support payment will be available for all those in receipt of household benefits, including those who make provision for their own water supply and sewerage and who will not be required to make payments to Irish Water.<\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The  OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that the reforms that have been introduced are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given increased life expectancy, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the increasing cost of pensions into the future.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. State pension age was increased to 66 and will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. <\/p><p>  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.   All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66. <\/p><p>  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years). In the case of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year. A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year. <\/p><p>  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures or activation-related sanctions but may avail of employment support<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.<\/p><p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[34072\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on a social welfare appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case on 24<sup>th<\/sup>September 2014.The person concerned has been notified of the arrangements for the hearing. <br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Legislation","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD06200"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[34079\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700053#WRD06300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will address the concerns regarding the Irish aviation superannuation scheme raised by a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>While I am aware of the issues arising in relation to this scheme, you will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on developments relating to a particular pension scheme as these are a matter for the management of the company and the trustees of the pension scheme.<\/p><p>  You will be aware that a number of changes were made to the Pensions Act in recent years to assist both the employers and the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes respond to the funding difficulties encountered by many schemes at this time.

The Government has provided &euro;31.3m for ENPs in 2014.<br\/><br\/>There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Examples of the main types of needs that are met under the scheme include assistance towards new house kit-outs, funeral and burial expenses, the purchase of household appliances, clothing and child related items such as cots and prams.<br\/><br\/>A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out during 2012 by a working group of staff from the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service.  One of the recommendations emanating from this review was to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, to the payment of ENPs.  This review has been used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013, recommending maximum amounts payable under the scheme for a variety of household and personal items, to ensure consistency with regard to payment levels on a national basis.<br\/><br\/>These guidelines assist Departmental staff and do not limit the discretionary powers available to officers administering the scheme to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  Officials in the Department continue to review the issue of payments under the ENP scheme to ensure consistency and fairness.<br\/><br\/>The number of ENP payments and expenditure for Dublin 15 and Dublin 24 for the years 2011 to 2014 are set out in the following tabular statement.

This key recommendation was aimed at improving the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system.<br\/><br\/>Changing demographics will see the ratio of working age to pensioner reduce from 5.3 to 1 to 2.1 to1 by 2060 and will result in significant upward pressure on the State finances which are required to fund pension provision.  Therefore, there is a need to encourage a long-term savings habit by individuals to supplement income from the State pension for those who will otherwise not be in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement.<br\/><br\/>Against this backdrop and in line with the OECD key recommendation and with the Programme for Government, the recent 2014-2016 Statement of Priorities confirmed that the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal supplementary pension saving scheme.  This decision has been taken in response to the adequacy and sustainability challenges in the Irish pensions system which has become an increasing concern in recent years.  Development of this roadmap for a universal pension over the course of 2015 will involve detailed consideration of policy and operational parameters, and will include co-operation across a range of Government departments and engagement with all sectoral interests.<br\/><br\/>A range of other reforms, consistent with the recommendations of the OECD Review, have recently been undertaken or are currently being undertaken.  These include, (but are not limited to) &ndash;<br\/><br\/><b>The State Pension <\/b><br\/><br\/>- the OECD noted that Ireland&rsquo;s raising of the State pension age to 66 from 2014, 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028 will bring increased sustainability to the pension system and recognised that by international comparison Ireland was &lsquo;ahead of the curve&rsquo; in already making hard decisions in this area;<br\/><br\/>- The OECD indicated that the link between social insurance contributions and benefits obtained from the State pension is weak and should be strengthened.  In this regard it noted that in April 2012 Ireland began to strengthen this link with the introduction of new rate bands and required level of contributions;<br\/><br\/>- The OECD further noted that this link between contributions and benefits will be further strengthened by the planned introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions&rsquo; approach in 2020<br\/><br\/><b>Occupational\/Supplementary Pensions<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The OECD referred to the existing tax deferral structure providing greater incentives for those with higher incomes to save for retirement.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the Government subsequently took the necessary measures to cap taxpayers subsidy for all future pensions schemes that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000;<br\/><br\/>- The OECD recommended reform that would allow for accrued benefits to be cut in the case of Defined Benefit (DB) scheme underfunding and for risks to be shared between plan members and pensioners, as well as plan sponsors.  The Government subsequently introduced the Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No) 2 2013 which provides for a fairer distribution of the assets amongst all members when an underfunded DB pension scheme is in wind up;<br\/><br\/>- In line with the OECD recommendation to strengthen the Irish legislation regarding the protection of DB plan members when plans wind up, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No) 2 2013 provides further protection to members of a double insolvency (scheme and employer) in the form of a State guarantee where all of the beneficiaries of the scheme (pensioners, current employees and former employees, not yet retired) will receive at least 50% of their benefits.  Existing defined benefit pensions in payment in such schemes will be 100% protected up to &euro;12,000;<br\/><br\/>- Provisions within the<b><\/b>Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No) 2 2013 facilitated the Pensions Authority (PA) introducing tighter regulation to protect DB scheme members.  This entails refusing to accept funding proposals from schemes with less than 50% funding and forcing schemes to take actions to address their very poor funding situations<b>.<\/b>It allows the PA impose additional obligations to ensure significantly underfunded schemes achieve a base level of funding in the short term.<br\/><br\/>In relation to public service pension provision, whilst this is a policy area proper to my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin T.D., it is worth noting that the OECD referred to the many important changes to public service pension provision in recent years and highlighted that in terms of public service pension reform Ireland &lsquo;<i>belonged to the group of more advanced countries in this area&rdquo;.  <\/i>This analysis by the OECD did not include the subsequent pension savings achieved by the Government under the Haddington Road Agreement.<br\/><br\/><b>Restructuring of the Pensions Board <\/b><br\/><br\/>In Qtr 1 2014, the governance of the Pensions Board (17 paid members) was restructured.  This followed a Government decision on the recommendations of the Critical Review Group provided for by the Public Service Reform Programme.  The new structure accommodates two distinct arms consisting of:<br\/><br\/>- a three-person <b>Pensions Authority<\/b>, comprised of an independent chair and 2 ex officio members of government bodies, to provide operational oversight of pensions regulation.  The Pensions Board changed name to the Pensions Authority.  The new governance structure commenced in March 2014 comprising a senior official from each of the Departments of Social Protection and Finance, and the re-appointment of the former Chairperson of the Pensions Board as Chairperson of the Authority; and<br\/><br\/>- a separate unpaid <b>Pensions Council<\/b>, with a majority of members representing consumer interests, which will advise the Minister on pensions policy.  The selection of candidates for positions on the Council is underway and will be completed shortly.<br\/><br\/><b>Merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman <\/b><br\/><br\/>- A Steering Group has been established and work is underway<b><\/b>to progress the merger recommended in the Critical Review.  The timeline for implementation has yet to be fully finalised but it is hoped to complete the merger by mid-2015.  Legislation will be required to effect the merger between the two offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700054#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700054#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[34299\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700054#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made in respect of an application for domiciliary care allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13.","asker":"1190","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was received from the person concerned on the 9th July 2014.

In addition, a small number of T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State&rsquo;s Office staff appointed to the Department are classified as new entrants.<br\/><br\/>Tables 1 &ndash; 4  detail the

Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private or commercial premises.  Action against the illicit trade in mineral oils includes measures to detect and shut down plants illegally laundering marked mineral oil, to detect illicit products in transit and seize both the products and the vehicles transporting them, and to prevent the sale of illicit products.<br\/><br\/>There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating these illicit trades, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups on tobacco and oils enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle these forms of crime.<br\/><br\/>Revenue's work against the illegal tobacco trade includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit product and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<br\/><br\/>Considerable success is being achieved in Revenue's action against the illicit trades.  The total seizures of illicit cigarettes, alcohol products and mineral oils, in each of the last three years are set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>Cigarettes<\/th><th><\/th><th>Alcohol<\/th><th><\/th><th>Oil<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>-<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><br \/><br \/>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(Million)<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><br \/><br \/>Value<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(&euro;m)<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><br \/><br \/>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(Litres)<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><br \/><br \/>Value<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(&euro;m)<br \/><br \/><\/td><td><br \/><br \/>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>(Litres)<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>40.8<\/td><td>18.9<\/td><td>55,755<\/td><td>1.5<\/td><td>874,882<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>95.6<\/td><td>43.3<\/td><td>33,059<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>1,113,142<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>109.1<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>34,040<\/td><td>0.5<\/td><td>1,044,830<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The table shows also the estimated value of the seizures of cigarettes and alcohol products.  That information is not available in respect of mineral oil products.<br\/><br\/>Seizures this year include one of some 32.2 million cigarettes, as well as 4.5 tonnes of water pipe tobacco, from a vessel at Drogheda Port.  This was the largest seizure to date in Europe this year, and was the result of an intelligence-led operation targeting the activities of an international organised crime group headed up by Irish and UK nationals and based in Europe.  Action against the illicit oil trade in the period since 2011 has led to the detection and shutting down of 30 oil laundries and to seizure of some 3 million litres of illicit fuel.  In addition, more than 120 filling stations were closed for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions.<br\/><br\/>Legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade:<br\/><br\/>- the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products;<br\/><br\/>- the Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production;<br\/><br\/>- provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production;<br\/><br\/>- the Finance Act 2013 also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products;<br\/><br\/>- the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<br\/><br\/>As well as those changes to primary law, the State, to give effect to EU Directive 2008\/118\/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.  The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300.  Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty.  This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.<br\/><br\/>In response to illicit fuel trading, Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.  Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market.  The supply chain controls introduced include new licencing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.  Revenue has also intensified its targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<br\/><br\/>To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity.<br\/><br\/>Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a new fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and they have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that this strategy has been very effective.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners will maintain their commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chains for illicit oil and tobacco products and will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in them are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.<br\/><br\/>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners continuously review their methodologies and their legislative requirements and where necessary I will of course, give careful consideration to any proposal that might be put to me in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding such work, Revenue is of the view that the interests of compliant businesses is best served by them playing their part in combating shadow economy activity by knowing their suppliers, not engaging in shadow economy activity themselves, producing (including anonymously) to Revenue or to other relevant State agencies - either directly or through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group - information relating to those persons who are involved in shadow economy activity in their geographical area.

In addition to over 5,000 individual residential units that NAMA debtors and receivers have sold to date, assets will continue to be made available for sale, on an individual basis, to potential purchasers.  NAMA's website includes a list of some 2,300 properties in Ireland which are either currently for sale or will shortly be offered for sale through receivers.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should note that, where NAMA arranges for the sale of portfolios of apartments, these are typically rented to tenants and there is no question of such tenants being placed at any disadvantage as a result of the change of ownership.  Indeed, it would not be fair or reasonable to displace tenants in order to offer the apartments for sale to purchasers\u00a0as either individual units or as part of a portfolio.  I would also point out that the purchasers of apartment blocks are usually large investors who tend to apply fully professional standards in their capacity as landlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700055#WRF07400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700055#WRF07500"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[32991\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700055#WRF07600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications that were successful under the start your own business exemption from income tax announced in the last budget; and the cost to the Exchequer.","asker":"1091","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>Section 6 of the Finance (No 2) Act 2013 introduced the Start Your Own Business\u00a0initiative which provides an exemption from income tax\u00a0for 2 years for individuals starting a new business where the individuals were previously long-term unemployed.

The decision by Revenue to examine this container was conveyed to the Customs clearance agent employed by the importer. The decision on whether or not the importer (or the declarant) wishes to be present during the examination is a matter between the importer and the agent and is not a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p><p>  In relation to the premises used for examination of goods, Article 239 of Commission Regulation (ECC) No 2454\/93 states:<\/p><p>  The goods shall be examined in the places designated and during the hours appointed for that purpose by the customs authorities.<\/p><p>  However, the customs authorities may, at the request of the declarant, authorise the examinations of goods in places or during hours other than those referred to in paragraph 1.<\/p><p>  Any costs involved shall be borne by the declarant.<\/p><p>  Each freight compound operator is obliged by Revenue, under the terms of his conditions of approval to operate such a compound, to have proper examination facilities in place for the conduct of Customs examinations. <\/p><p>  The decisions regarding the selection of import agent, the routing of the goods, and the freight compound through which the goods were imported are decisions that are made by the importer or persons acting on his behalf.<\/p><p>  The Customs Code provides that the declarant is responsible for any costs incurred in the examination process and compound operators generally raise a charge for this service. As advised in the reply to Question No. 215 on 8 July, 2014, the costs for the provision of the examination facilities and for stripping and repacking containers are costs determined by the freight compound operators. There are three freight compound operators in Dublin Port. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for the Revenue Commissioners to have a role in the setting of commercial charges between competing businesses. <\/p><p>  Officers from Revenue's Customs Service carry out a wide range of functions and interventions to ensure that Ireland's import and export trades are facilitated as effectively and efficiently as possible, but with due regard to the wide range of control measures in place to prevent the illegal importation of goods, and to ensure that the correct customs duties are paid. It would not be practicable from cost, resource management or risk management perspectives to facilitate the physical examinations of containers at the widely dispersed nationwide locations of importers.<\/p><p>  Revenue carries out a risk analysis on all consignments coming from outside the EU.\u00a0 This analysis is based on a range of criteria that includes assessing risk such as food and product safety, counterfeit goods, fiscal, illicit drugs and tobacco smuggling.\u00a0 In addition to the risk based interventions, Revenue is also obliged under EU legislation (Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454\/93, Chapter 5, Article 4f, 2), to implement a program of random interventions. The Deputy will understand that the specific risks that trigger interventions in any particular case are confidential.<\/p><p>  With reference to the Deputy's reference to VAT audits and other related interventions, these are generally inspections of the taxpayers books and \u00a0records, and are conducted by correspondence or in the taxpayers place of business.\u00a0 In general these interventions do not involve inspection of goods or stock in transit.\u00a0 Where costs are incurred in relation to these interventions (e.g. accountant or tax advisor charges), such costs are borne by the\u00a0 taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Payments","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[33186\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will support a matter (details supplied) regarding VAT on carbon tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1048","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201, 202 and 208 together.<\/p><p>  As they each relate to the issue of\u00a0 access to the Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) option for holders of Buy-out Bonds (BOBs).<\/p><p>  By way of background, ARFs were introduced by Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to holders of personal pensions and to proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF, subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>  The ARF option was extended, in Finance Act 2000, to the part of an employee s occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and most recently, in Finance Act 2011, it was further extended to cover an employee s entire pension fund where the fund is a defined contribution (DC) occupational pension scheme. The 2011 extension which applied with effect from 6 February 2011 (the date of passing of the Act), was in respect of DC schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners, on or after that date, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Where DC occupational pension schemes had been approved by Revenue prior to that date, the legislation provided that the extension of the ARF option in such cases was conditional on the scheme rules being amended to allow a scheme member exercise the option. Earlier this year, I agreed to a proposal that the Revenue Commissioners will allow access to the ARF option for all holders of BOBs, the values in which have been transferred from DC schemes, regardless of the date of transfer.<\/p><p>  The 2011 Finance Act, did not, however, extend the ARF option to the main scheme benefits of defined benefit (DB) occupational schemes as this option was not intended for DB scheme benefits, generally.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that pension retirement bonds, otherwise known as Buy-out-Bonds (BOBs), are single premium insurance policies effected by the trustees of an occupational pension scheme on behalf of a scheme member, as an alternative to providing a preserved retirement benefit under the scheme for that member. They are used in circumstances where a scheme member is leaving service and opts for a transfer value, on the wind-up of a scheme or where pension splitting arises in the context of a Pension Adjustment Order. BOBs are approved by the Commissioners on a generic, rather than on an individual basis, in the form of a standard bond policy document, under Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the TCA 1997 as DC products. However, in the view of the Commissioners, BOBs are not occupational pension savings vehicles in the normally accepted sense   for example, an individual with a BOB cannot make contributions to the BOB. Rather, they are a specialist pension vehicle to deal with the specific situations described above.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that it has always been a condition of approval of generic BOB policies that the benefits to be provided to an individual under such policies be subject to the same restrictions and conditions that applied to the occupational pension scheme from which the transfer to the BOB originated. This includes access to the ARF option. The entitlement to the ARF option, in effect, travels with the transfer value paid into the bond and the fact that the BOB is considered a DC pension product does not, of itself, give entitlement to the ARF option from the BOB as of right. Thus, prior to the Finance Act 2011 changes, the ARF option only applied to benefits under a BOB where the bond holder could have availed of the option under the originating occupational pension scheme, e.g. that the bond holder was a proprietary director before leaving service or that part of the originating transfer represented AVCs. There was no alteration in this position insofar as BOBs originating from DB schemes is concerned following the Finance Act 2011 and more recent administrative changes.<\/p><p>  The issues around allowing access to the ARF option for BOBs whose values have transferred from DB pension schemes are broader than the tax policy considerations for which I have responsibility and are matters of general pension policy for which my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton TD, has responsibility. I understand that both the Tanaiste and the Pensions Authority have concerns that the extension of the ARF option as being suggested could have fundamental implications for the DB model and potentially impact both on the Funding Standard and on the benefit promise to DB scheme members. \u00a0However, I further understand that the issue of ARF access for BOBs originating from DB schemes will be considered by the Tanaiste s Department in the context of a review of personal pension vehicles aimed at rationalising provision in this area. It is expected that this review will be undertaken in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Betting Regulations","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[33281\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if bets on roulette games in licensed bookmakers premises are subject to VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>One of the main purposes of section 18 of the Finance Act 2013 is to correct an anomaly which, up\u00a0until that time, allowed\u00a0land dealers and developers to potentially obtain a tax\u00a0deduction in circumstances where they suffered no real economic loss. The provision applies only in very specific circumstances by effectively\u00a0clawing back a tax deduction, which the taxpayer obtained, arising from the decline in land and property values where the loans taken out to acquire this land and property have been written down by the lending institution and are no longer required to be repaid. \u00a0This debt write down may have arisen through negotiation with the taxpayer, as a result of bankruptcy or personal\u00a0insolvency or by virtue of the terms of the loan agreement itself. In these circumstances, it is the lending institution, not the borrower, who has actually suffered the loss.<\/p><p>  \u00a0The provision only applies to those engaged in the trade of dealing in or developing land. It has no relevance to loans used to purchase a person's principal private residence or to landlords, in respect of rental properties, because no tax deduction was available to these people in the first place. It only applies to loans used to acquire land held as trading stock. \u00a0Where a land dealer acquires land with borrowed money and the land subsequently falls in value, the land dealer is entitled to a deduction equal to the fall in value, in computing the profits of the landing dealing trade. This deduction can reduce the taxable profits of the trade.\u00a0 Where it results in a tax loss, that loss can be carried forward against future profits of the same trade or set off\u00a0 for tax purposes against other income in the year the loss arises. However, where the land has been purchased with borrowed money and the loan is subsequently written off, the trader has not suffered any economic loss. Section 18 deals with this by treating the dealer as having received an income equal to the write down. \u00a0The effect of this is to cancel out the deduction already claimed. This is not an additional charge but a clawback of a relief which is no longer justified. \u00a0Where the fall in the value of the land has resulted in a trading loss which has been carried forward by the taxpayer, the loss will cancel the charge imposed by section 18 and no further tax should arise. However, if the deduction has been used to reduce tax on other income of the taxpayer in previous years, then tax will arise. This represents a clawback of a relief granted in respect of a tax loss where there is no economic loss. The rate of tax which will apply will depend on the person's level of income in that year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Central Bank","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG04650"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[33308\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700056#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland will continue to be a full voting member of the ECB governing council when Lithuania joins the currency area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, I introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015 to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.<\/p><p>  The additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 will also be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties although funds from the levy will not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose.

The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed. Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot; <br\/><br\/>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals. In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted. <br\/><br\/>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves. &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working. Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.\u00a0 The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.I am also advised that whether households, where high level care is provided, qualify for relief under section 15A, or for exemption under section 10B, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may be aware that following representations and a review of the reliefs, I announced on 2 May 2014 that I intend bringing forward legislation amending section 15A to remove the requirement that any adaptation work on the residential property must be grant-aided, or has been approved for grant-aid, by a local authority as one of the qualifying conditions for the tax relief.\u00a0 I also intend to remove the requirement, by way of legislation amending section 10B, that a permanent and totally incapacitated person must have benefitted from a Court or Injuries Board award or a public trust fund, to qualify for the exemption.<br\/><br\/>My officials wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advising her of my intention to retrospectively amend the legislation. In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.\u00a0 The Commissioners have published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue. The Guidelines are available on their website at: . <br\/><br\/>Under the new arrangements, applications for the reduction in market value should be made on . Applications for the exemption should be made on \u00a0or, where the application concerns a permanently and totally incapacitated child for whom the Department of Social Protection pay a Domiciliary Care Allowance \u00a0should be completed. Applications should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick. I am informed that Revenue will examine each application and may seek additional information if considered necessary before determining whether the person is entitled to a reduction in the market value of the property or to the exemption, whichever one is being claimed. <br\/><br\/>The Commissioners have also advised that no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the reduction in the market value under the LPT legislation and the liable person declared the reduced valuation when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return. Similarly, no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the exemption and the exemption was claimed when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return.\u00a0 The reliefs will continue to apply for all years up to 2016, inclusive.<br\/><br\/>I have no plans for the further extension of exemptions in relation to the above issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700057#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Regulation","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700057#WRH01850"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[33480\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700057#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of Section 90 reviews of credit unions carried out by the Central Bank of Ireland in each year since 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

ESA 2010 are an update of the current rules of national accounts (ESA 95) and must be adopted by all member states by September 2014.<br\/><br\/>The primary impact of the new rules is a change in the methodology for calculation of GDP as a result of which the level of nominal GDP increases thus improving the key ratios (Debt to GDP and deficit to GDP). These amended GDP figures were first published by the CSO as part of their National Income and Expenditure (NIE) results 2013 on 03 July 2014. This new measurement basis has been widely discussed in Ireland and other EU member states.<br\/><br\/>The impact of ESA 2010 can be seen in the overall deficit and debt figures and the underlying components of these two measures. The changes which impact on deficit and debt can be broken into three categories: sector classification changes; changes in the treatment of the assets and liabilities of pension schemes where pension obligations are transferred to government; changes in the treatment of interest on swaps and forward rate agreements (FRAs)<br\/><br\/>The sector classification issue with the greatest level of materiality is in relation to the classification of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) in the general government sector with effect from mid-2011. This is as a result of the technical change from the ESA 95 standards whereby entities that were classified as Monetary Financial Institutions were excluded from general government. This automatic exclusion no longer applies under ESA 2010. \u00a0This inclusion of IBRC will primarily impact the deficit and debt for the period 2011-2013, with little or no effect in 2014 due to the progression of the liquidation process, and is set out as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014f<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>GG Deficit impact<\/td><td>-0.2<\/td><td>-0.4<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>0.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>(% GDP; - implies deficit worsened, + implies deficit improvement)<\/td><td>~<\/td><td>~<\/td><td>~<\/td><td>~<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GG Debt impact<\/td><td>12.2<\/td><td>10.3<\/td><td>7.2<\/td><td>1.0*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>(% GDP; + implies debt increase)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table>*This is a current provisional estimate.<br\/><br\/>Under ESA 95, the transfer of a pension fund to government was treated as revenue in the year that it took place. However, using ESA 2010 rules there is a neutral effect where the assets and liabilities are equal and a negative impact on the deficit where the liabilities exceed the assets of the scheme. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>Under ESA 2010 the calculation of interest for government deficit purposes will in future be measured pre-swap under ESA 2010 rather than the current post-swap basis.

An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements with their customers in mortgage arrears. Targets have been set to the end of 2014 and by this date the relevant banks covered by the MART process will be required to have proposed sustainable solutions to 85% of mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears and to have concluded solutions with 45% of such mortgages;<br\/><br\/>2. Significant reforms to personal insolvency and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, to provide more accessible and flexible statutory frameworks for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;<br\/><br\/>3. Updating the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to provide additional safeguards to cooperating borrowers while also promoting and encouraging efforts by both lenders and borrowers to meaningfully address mortgage arrears or pre-arrears;<br\/><br\/>4.

I have, however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I am doing this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create thousands of new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.<\/p><p>  The additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 will also be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties although funds from the levy will not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose. The Government has decided that such liabilities will be met by the Exchequer as they arise.<\/p><p>  While the pension fund levy does not apply to unfunded public service pension schemes, the pensions of public servants, including those of Government Ministers and TDs, have been subject to a public service pension reduction (PSPR) since 1 January 2011. The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. The PSPR is not a levy, but is a pension cut affecting public service pensions. At the time of its introduction, the PSPR was designed to cut all public service pensions above &euro;12,000 in payment or awarded up to the end of a &quot;grace period&quot;, which ultimately expired at the end of February 2012. The PSPR did not originally apply to any pensions of post-grace period retirees, on the basis that their pension awards had otherwise been reduced by being based on actual reduced pay rates reflective of the 2010 pay cuts, not &quot;pre-cut&quot; pay rates as applied to retirees during the grace period. On introduction, the PSPR was estimated as reducing public service pensions by 4% on average, with more severe effects experienced at higher pension levels due to the progressive multi-band structure of the reduction.<\/p><p>  A change to the PSPR was made on 1 January 2012, when a 20% reduction rate (previously 12%) was imposed on pension amounts above &euro;100,000. With effect from 1 July 2013, more changes were made to the PSPR to deliver on the Government's commitment to further reducing those public service pensions above &euro;32,500 by between 2% and 5% in certain circumstances, including the pensions above that level of individuals who retired after end- February 2012.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is very difficult to determine the precise number of jobs that have been created in the economy as result of the Jobs Initiative. \u00a0However, I would point out that the most up to-date data, the Quarterly National Household Survey - Quarter 2, 2014, indicates that there is an additional 40,300 individuals employed in the economy when compared to same period in 2011.\u00a0 Furthermore, there is an additional 23,300 individuals employed in tourism and hospitality sectors, which were the sectors that specifically benefit from the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%. Similarly, it is not possible to determine the precise net benefit to the Exchequer as a result of the additional jobs created since the reduction in the VAT rate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts to date from the 0.6% Stamp Duty levy on pension fund assets, introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, are &euro;463 million in 2011, &euro;483 million in 2012 and &euro;535 million in 2013. <\/p><p>  The position is that all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and create new jobs.\u00a0 These include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and the Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I am conscious of the significant contribution of taxpayers, generally, to the rebalancing of the public finances and the measures introduced to support and develop the economy. There has been progress in these areas. These efforts are ongoing, including the continuation of measures in the Jobs Initiative, designed to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment in the shortest timeframe possible. <\/p><p>  Preparations for Budget 2015 and the consequent Finance Bill are ongoing. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what changes, if any, are being considered in the pension fund levy or any other tax measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700059#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700059#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[34290\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700059#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 31 of 5 June 2014, if the review aimed at streamlining and modernising the scheme has concluded; if it will address the concerns regarding the purchase of a suitable second-hand vehicle and the concessions for motor tax and fuel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>As I said in my response of 5 June last, I have asked my officials to examine the Regulations surrounding the Disabled Drivers and Disabled\u00a0Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme.

This was the period during which house prices peaked.

In addition, the table also sets out the Budget 2014 forecast for CAT receipts for this year.<br\/><br\/><b>CAT receipts 2008 to 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>&euro;000<\/th><th>2008 Outturn <\/th><th>2009 Outturn <\/th><th>2010 Outturn <\/th><th>2011 Outturn\u00a0 <\/th><th>2012 Outturn <\/th><th>2013 Outturn <\/th><th>*2014 estimated Outturn <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CAT<\/td><td>331,600<\/td><td>254,258<\/td><td>237,769<\/td><td>243,507<\/td><td>282,928<\/td><td>278,632<\/td><td>380,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":813,"content":"<p>Question No. 305 answered with Question No. 293.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Cost","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[34382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the estimated cost of agricultural relief, business relief, favoured nephew status and dwelling house relief against CAT, together with the number of claims received for each of the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost of the reliefs outlined above are as shown in the following table in so far as they are available. <table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Agricultural Relief<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Claims allowed<\/td><td>1,654<\/td><td>1,499<\/td><td>1,747<\/td><td>1,594<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Cost of\u00a0 Agricultural Relief <\/td><td>&euro;59m <\/td><td>&euro;60m <\/td><td>&euro;77m <\/td><td>&euro;73m <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Business Relief<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Claims allowed<\/td><td>392<\/td><td>504<\/td><td>622<\/td><td>440<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated\u00a0 Cost of\u00a0 Business Relief <\/td><td>&euro;62m <\/td><td>&euro;70m <\/td><td>&euro;212m <\/td><td>&euro;93m <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Favourite Nephew Relief<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Claims allowed<\/td><td>107<\/td><td>103 <\/td><td>106<\/td><td>92 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Cost of\u00a0 favourite nephew relief <\/td><td>Not available <\/td><td>Not available<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dwelling House Relief<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Claims allowed<\/td><td>441 <\/td><td>573 <\/td><td>504 <\/td><td>545 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Cost\u00a0 of dwelling house exemption <\/td><td>Not available<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>Note: The estimated cost for the agricultural and business reliefs are particularly tentative because of the potential for diluting the cost by the availability of unused exemption from unabsorbed group thresholds.<br\/><br\/>The cost of favourite nephew relief and dwelling house relief is not shown as the necessary detailed data is not available to provide a basis for estimating these costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":817,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[34388\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of taxpayers within the high earner restriction in 2012, analysed within income bands of &euro;125,000 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;500,000, &euro;500,001 to &euro;750,000, &euro;750,001 to &euro;1,000,000 and more than &euro;1 million;

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/><br\/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.\u00a0 In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br\/><br\/>I\u00a0would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br\/><br\/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;. \u00a0No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief. \u00a0Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).\u00a0 Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750. \u00a0Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375. \u00a0Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course\u00a0on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>&euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition fees<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capped at <\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less<\/td><td>&euro;2,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>I have no plans to introduce tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme as tax relief is already provided for the tuition fees.

The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.<br\/><br\/>Following the severe weather events at the end 2013\/early 2014, and on foot of Government decision to provide up to &euro;19.6m for storm damages to public coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure, the OPW has allocated funding of &euro;18.3m to local authorities for programmes of works to repair damaged public coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.\u00a0 The overall response to the severe weather events was co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the funding for repair of coastal defences is part of a total of up to &euro;70 million which the Government has allocated for repair and remediation works arising from the storms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Audits","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[34630\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 38 of 11 June 2014, the position regarding the Revenue Commissioners audits for 2014 in respect of self-employed contractors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market. The supply chain controls introduced include new licensing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.  Revenue also intensified its targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations. <\/p><p>  I have introduced the necessary legislative provisions for these new measures, and introduced a further provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. <\/p><p>  Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.<\/p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed a joint \u00a0Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a new fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  Revenue has also adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle illicit tobacco, based on the development of improved intelligence on international and domestic distribution networks and risk based checks on cargo and passengers. \u00a0Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private or commercial premises.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating these illicit trades, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups on tobacco and oils enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle these forms of crime.<\/p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved in Revenue's action against the illicit trades.  Over 245 million cigarettes have been seized in the period 2011   2013. Seizures this year include one of some 32.2 million cigarettes, as well as 4.5 tonnes of water pipe tobacco, from a vessel at Drogheda Port. This was the largest seizure to date in Europe this year, and was the result of an intelligence-led operation targeting the activities of an international organised crime group headed up by Irish and UK nationals and based in Europe. <\/p><p>  Action against the illicit oil trade in the period since 2011 has led to the detection and shutting down of 30 oil laundries and to seizure of some 3 million litres of illicit fuel. In addition, more than 120 filling stations were closed for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions. \u00a0<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners review their strategies in relation to fuel fraud and illicit tobacco on a continuous basis and where they identify a need for legislative provisions to strengthen the legal framework for tackling illegal activity and protecting legitimate business I will consider such proposals very carefully.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I am satisfied with the progress made by Revenue in tackling fuel fraud and illicit tobacco and with the excellent cooperation between Revenue and the fuel sector in implementing very significant supply chain controls over the past three years.  I am also pleased with the positive feedback from the fuel sector about the positive impact of the measures and the reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market.

This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. <\/p><p>  What is now required \u00a0is a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty and the aim is to have this process completed by November this year, subject to completion of national approval procedures.\u00a0\u00a0 This would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be in November of this year. <\/p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation, the preliminary agreement states that the potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement. Obviously, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation before\u00a0the Instrument is\u00a0in place and\u00a0it would therefore be premature to\u00a0make any submission in advance of that.<\/p><p>  In relation to the planned early repayment of our IMF loan, the proposal is to repay up to &euro;18 billion of this loan and to replace it with less expensive market funding. <\/p><p>  For this to succeed we require\u00a0a waiver of mandatory early repayment clauses which are included in each of our loan agreements with the EFSF and the EFSM, and with our bilateral lenders, the U.K., Denmark and Sweden.<\/p><p>  Our request for such a waiver was discussed at meetings of the Eurogoup and ECOFIN Ministers last weekend. There was unanimous political support among the Ministers for the proposal. However, a number of countries will have to go through national approval procedures before they can approve the waiver sought. This includes Sweden, where parliamentary elections have just taken place.<\/p><p>  The ECB supported this initiative, but raised concerns regarding the IBRC related bonds held by the Central Bank of Ireland. However, as the ECB also acknowledged, this is a separate issue, which is not related to the early repayment proposal.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL05000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Bonds","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL05050"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[34775\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700060#WRL05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the timing of the sale of long-term Government bonds as agreed in 2013 when the promissory note was replaced; the amounts arising from these bond sales: if there has been any change in the timing of bond sales: the amounts to be sold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Such rateable premises would ordinarily include playschools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools. <br\/><br\/>The Act is quite specific in relation to the exemptions that can be implemented by the Commissioner of Valuation. These are set out in Schedule 4 of the Act and there is no discretion to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.\u00a0 Buildings which qualify for exemption from rates under the provisions of Schedule 4 would principally include those used for public worship, education and health-care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>A property used for educational purposes is entitled to exemption from rates if all of the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met which in summary are;<br\/><br\/>1.It must be occupied by an educational institution<br\/><br\/>2.It must be used exclusively for the provision of educational services<br\/><br\/>3.Otherwise than for private profit;(a) the institution must not be established or operated for the purposes of making a private profit <b>or<\/b>be financed wholly or mainly from State funds and (b) The services in question must be available to the general public with or without acharge being levied.<br\/><br\/>The position regarding eligibility of operators of childcare facilities for exemption from rates is that in order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt under the terms of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, that organisation must be a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of \u00a0&quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001.<br\/><br\/>As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Act as it relates to child-care facilities and all other categories of properties. <br\/><br\/>Private childcare facilities form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. I have no plans to provide for special treatment of these facilities by their exemption from rateability under the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2014 as such a change would be quickly followed by demands for similar treatment from other interests involved in the provision of other useful services, which in equity would be difficult to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which\u00a0 would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700061#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700061#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[33125\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700061#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if previous experience in the position advertised or in a similar position will be taken into account in the recruitment process for clerical officers in the Revenue Commissioners;

More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.<br\/><br\/>Pending the completion of the CFRAM Programme, the OPW is continuing with its programme of major flood relief schemes. These schemes are focused on locations throughout the country where significant flood events have occurred in the past. Cost benefit analysis is the standard methodology used to determine priorities and for selection of major schemes.  Benefits are measured in terms of the damage and loss avoided. Details of major schemes are available on under Flood Risk Management.<br\/><br\/>Identification and assessment of flood risk at local level within each county is a matter for the local authority concerned. It is open to local authorities to apply for funding under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, introduced in 2009. The Scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Applications for funding are considered having regard to assessment criteria including a minimum benefit to cost ratio of 1.5:1 and the availability of funds.<br\/><br\/>The Government decided on 11th February 2014 to allocate up to &euro;69.5 million for repair and remediation of public infrastructure that was damaged by severe weather in the period 13th December 2013 to 6th 2014 January.  <br\/><br\/>Of the figure of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair by local authorities of existing built coastal protection and flood defences in the affected areas, based on estimates submitted by them to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Exceptions to this 28 day guideline would apply in the cases, first, of perishable products with a short shelf life and, secondly, of seasonal products which should be on sale for at least 14 days in the previous three month period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Expenditure","counter":1063,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[33505\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the costs that will be incurred in the establishment of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1065,"content":"<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will be established on 31 October 2014 through the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. <\/p><p>  Savings of approximately &euro;1,700,000 over the next ten years will be achieved as there will be no fees for a Board or Chairperson to be paid (or associated costs such as travel and subsistence for Board members) while some other savings should be realised in relation to public relations and audit activities.<\/p><p>  Necessary preparations leading up to the establishment of the Commission have been underway since 2013 and these have intensified this year.

To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director General will be assisted by a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar. The Registrar will act as legal advisor to the Director General of the WRC and will perform a range of functions that are similar to those of the Legal Advisor to the Equality Tribunal.<br\/><br\/>Nobody who has an entitlement to an adjudication hearing will be denied a hearing. However, apercentage of employment rights complaints are inevitably flawed on technical grounds: they may be filed well outside the statutory time limit; they may not disclose any cause of action or they may fail to name any respondent. One of the functions to be fulfilled by the Registrar will be to inform complainants of any such infirmity in their complaint at as early a stage as possible. It is in the interest of both parties and the State that efficiency is introduced into the system by obviating the need to convene a full hearing to deal with such procedural matters. <br\/><br\/>Such complaints may therefore be referred by the Registrar for determination by an Adjudication Officer of the WRC without a hearing being held.  The Bill provides that an Adjudication Officer will have the power to dismiss a complaint in circumstances where he or she forms the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious.  Such a decision can be appealed to the Labour Court. <br\/><br\/>The words &ldquo;frivolous or vexatious&rdquo; are legal terms, they are not pejorative in any sense.  It is merely a question of saying that as far as the complainant is concerned if he or she has no reasonable chance of succeeding then the law says that it is frivolous to bring the case.  Similarly, it is a hardship on the defendants to have to take steps to defend something which cannot succeed and the law calls that vexatious.<br\/><br\/>The current regime operated by the Director of the Equality Tribunal provides a very good example of the effective filtering of complaints on receipt.

The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose. For this reason, provision has been made in the Workplace Relations Bill 2014 for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Payment Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations. <\/p><p>  Section 35 of the Bill makes provision for the use of Fixed Payment Notices in respect of a specified range of acts of non-compliance on the part of employers. The matters in respect of which a Fixed Payment Notice may be issued are specified in subsection 5. The use of this mechanism is intended to encourage compliance with employment law and reduce the need to rely on expensive and time consuming prosecution procedures for the scheduled acts of non-compliance. <\/p><p>  Where an inspector detects suspected non-compliance in respect of one or more of the scheduled offences, he or she shall serve a Fixed Payment Notice. If the person on whom the notice is served pays the charge the matter does not proceed to Court. However, if the person fails or refuses to pay the charge the matter can be progressed to the District Court where the defendant can defend their position in the normal way.<\/p><p>  The Fixed Payment Notice process, as provided for in the Bill, is being introduced as a measure to achieve a more effective system of compliance with employment law.  This measure will be an entirely separate mechanism from the new structures being established in the legislation for the adjudication of employment rights disputes. The Bill provides that all first instance complaints under employment rights and equality legislation will be dealt with by WRC Adjudicators with a right of appeal to the Labour Court (except appeals under the Equal Status Acts which will continue to be dealt with by the Circuit Court). Under the legislation neither the WRC Adjudication Service nor the Labour Court will have any role in the Fixed Payment Notice process. The Bill also makes provision for the introduction of a more effective and streamlined system for the enforcement of awards from WRC Adjudicators and\/or the Labour Court under employment rights legislation via the District Court. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that these new compliance and enforcement measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO08900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[34409\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO09100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the decision to conduct Workplace Relation Commission mediation and adjudication hearings otherwise than in public is in contravention of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which states that everyone has a right to a fair and public hearing.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>The aim of the Workplace Relations Bill is to create a modern, user-friendly, world-class employment workplace relations system that will provide significant benefits for its users and society as a whole. The focus will be on resolving the workplace disputes as quickly and inexpensively as possible.<\/p><p>  The legislation makes provision for the establishment of a range of services (including mediation) to facilitate the resolution of employment rights disputes where possible at an early stage and without recourse to adjudication. Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process that allows two or more disputing parties to resolve their conflict in a mutually agreeable way with the help of a neutral third party, a mediator.  The mediation service provided by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) will be akin to the mediation service which is currently provided by the Equality Tribunal under equality legislation. Should mediation yield a compromise or settlement between the parties or a withdrawal of the complaint, the outcome will be confidential to the parties. Likewise, if the mediation is unsuccessful, anything divulged by the parties in the process cannot be used subsequently in the adjudication or inspection process. Given the confidential nature of the mediation process, the   decision to conduct WRC mediation otherwise than in public, is not in contravention with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.<\/p><p>Where employment rights complaints cannot be resolved at local level or with the assistance of the WRC dispute resolution services, parties will have access to a professional and trusted adjudication service.  My objective is to ensure that stakeholders have confidence that cases dealt with by the Adjudication Service of the WRC will be heard in a fair and transparent manner in accordance with the law and that the principles of natural justice apply.   The Workplace Relations Bill makes provision for the replacement of the existing complex system of five different bodies with a straightforward two-tier system for the adjudication of employment rights disputes. The WRC Adjudication Service will deal with all disputes of right in the first instance and the Labour Court will deal with all such cases on appeal. <\/p><p>  Private hearings are not contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The vast majority of employees and employers do not want the details of their relationship, or the personal details which may arise in the course of a hearing, aired in public. There does not appear to be any great demand for public hearings from employers or employees. Currently, for example, all Labour Court hearings are held in private. However, parties may request public hearings under certain Acts. <\/p><p>  As regards the right under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU to have one&rsquo;s rights determined in public, either party will be able to appeal a WRC decision to the Labour Court. This appeal hearing will be in public. That &ndash; and the fact that the WRC and Labour Court will be subject to the supervision of the High Court by way of Judicial Review &ndash; means that the requirements of the Charter are satisfied.  This view is supported by the Attorney General.<\/p><p>  Having given due consideration to the State&rsquo;s obligations under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights, and bearing in mind in particular the unique nature of the employment relationship, the Bill provides expressly that employment rights and equality complaints should be heard in private at first instance. Appeals to the Labour Court will be heard in public, thus ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Disputes of interest will continue to be heard in private (both at first instance and on appeal).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700063#WRO09200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":1132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1133,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[34410\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to seek the necessary approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the free trade agreement between the European Union and Colombia.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":1134,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[34411\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there will be a D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann debate on the proposed free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1135,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 414 and 415 together.<br\/><br\/>The Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of Peru, is an Agreement within the meaning of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.

The inception and development of the concept involved a cross sectoral Steering Group comprising members from academia, the research community, the enterprise sector and research funding Government Departments and agencies.  The implementation phase involved all research funders in the development of the action plans which were then validated by stakeholders across the system. In addition, the identification of the fine-grained research needs of enterprise was validated by similar stakeholders.  Furthermore, a panel of independent experts will be appointed shortly to conduct an external assessment of implementation of research prioritisation.<\/p><p>  There are also a range of initiatives and specific studies underway which will feed into the new Strategy, each involving extensive stakeholder consultation in their own right.

Increased industrial competitiveness can be a strong driver of growth and employment and is one of the stated objectives of European integration under the Lisbon Treaty.<br\/><br\/>The 2010 European Commission Communication &quot;An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era&quot;, a flagship initiative of the , sets out a strategy that aims to boost growth and jobs by maintaining and supporting a strong, diversified and competitive industrial base in Europe offering well-paid jobs while becoming more resource efficient.<br\/><br\/>The Commission&rsquo;s initiative to strengthen the EU defence and security sector is one of several being explored under this drive to increase industrial competitiveness. The Commission has produced a report on this initiative which is due for consideration at the European Council in June 2015. The report has been presented to the Competitiveness Council which I attend. I continue to monitor any developments with the initiative.<br\/><br\/>The initiative seeks to strengthen the internal market for defence, to promote a more competitive defence industry and to foster synergies between civil and military research. It also seeks to explore options in other areas such as energy, space and dual-use capabilities. <br\/><br\/>Discussions to date have focussed on opportunities for enhancing research and development and industrial competitiveness. Research in this area provides indirect impacts in other sectors such as electronics, key enabling technologies, space and civil aviation. <br\/><br\/>Ireland purchases defence equipment and is an exporter of dual-use goods. Through Science Foundation Ireland my Department seeks to build and strengthen scientific and engineering research initiatives. This initiative to strengthen the internal market for defence and to foster synergies between civil and military research has potential to improve Ireland's competitiveness.<br\/><br\/>Ireland does not have a specialised Defence industry and there are no plans to develop one. However, jobs are sustained through the synergies that can be achieved from civil and military actors working together to support and create jobs and growth in our economy. Defence is a large industry sector within the EU employing directly or indirectly up to 1.4 million people across the Union with a turnover of &euro;92billion in 2012.  As a key industry sector, the Commission has a role in applying internal market rules to the defence industry.<br\/><br\/>Troops on operations, including our own Defence Forces engaged on UN mandated operations, require effective force protection and defensive equipment.  If the European Union is to be an effective security actor, it needs a defence industry which can deliver the necessary capabilities\/equipment required for Common Security and Defence Policy missions, which is innovative, competitive and sustainable.  <br\/><br\/>As a procurer of defence equipment for our Defence Forces, initiatives which deliver greater efficiency and reduce the cost of defensive equipment are of interest to Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware of the careful analysis undertaken by my Department of export licence applications. My Department considers all applications in the light of the spirit and objectives of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and requests the observations of the Department of Foreign and Affairs and Trade on all military licence applications.<br\/><br\/>Alongside this scrutiny of export licence applications, Ireland is at the forefront in promoting responsible exports of armaments and controlled materials not only by other Member States but internationally. We were one of the first countries to sign the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). This followed a decade of efforts to bring regulation to the global trade in conventional arms. Ireland, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, argued for a strong and robust ATT from the very beginning, working with other countries and with civil society to achieve that goal.<br\/><br\/>The treaty is the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons. States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights. It prohibits a State from authorising arms exports where it has knowledge that the weapons will be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or other war crimes.

Imports from Russia were largely made up of cereals and animal feed.<br\/><br\/>Not all agricultural products were affected by the Presidential ban. Tea extract, infant formula, casein and beverages are not subject to the trade restrictions. Moreover, Russia had already imposed a blanket ban on exports of pig-meat from the EU earlier in the year arising from an African Swine fever outbreak in Eastern Europe. There were also existing temporary restrictions in place on certain Irish plants producing dairy products, beef, beef offal and seafood arising from a Russian audit visit earlier this year so that the effect of the Presidential ban was incremental. My Department and the Irish Embassy in Moscow have been heavily engaged with the Russian authorities on this matter and are submitting the required corrective actions to have these temporary restrictions lifted as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Having said that, the closure of the Russian market is clearly a matter of concern for Irish producers. Last year Irish agri-food exports to this market accounted for 2.5% of our total agri-food exports. We had identified Russia as a major strategic market for Irish dairy produce in particular. Indeed we had seen significant increases of all food and drink exports to Russia over the past four years and we had hoped to build on this trade in the coming years. Coming on top of the series of restrictive measures taken by the Russian authorities earlier in 2014 which affected our exports of pigmeat, in particular, to Russia, the Presidential ban was a significant setback to our strategic plans. <br\/><br\/>Apart from the direct effect of the loss of the Russian market, the big issue for Ireland is the displacement effect on European exports and the need to find alternative markets.  There is no doubt that the loss of a market as large as Russia will have knock-on effects for all EU producers. While the impact on some sectors is immediate, I am alert to the potential impact of a longer-term ban across all sectors including beef and pigmeat.<br\/><br\/>The response to the Russian restrictions is being taken at a number of different levels .<br\/><br\/>Immediately upon announcement of the Presidential ban, I asked Bord Bia to establish an advice line to make the most up to date information available to Irish companies exporting to Russia. This dedicated support unit is assisting companies with regard to the trading situation and in progressing opportunities elsewhere. I and my Department are making strenuous efforts to create other market opportunities for Irish agri-food exports and last month we were successful in securing the opening of the Philippines to exports of Irish beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>and the Vietnamese market for Irish pigmeat. These are key markets in South East Asia which have been identified by Irish exporters as being of major strategic importance. This is, of necessity, a long-term strategy. Later this year I will be undertaking a trade mission to China. China is a crucially important growth market for Irish food and drinks with vast import potential across a number of agricultural sectors. <br\/><br\/>In the meanwhile, my officials, including the agricultural attach&eacute; I appointed to Moscow last year continue to liaise at official level with the Russian authorities to resolve any technical issues still outstanding so that exports can flow freely once the current political situation is resolved and relations normalised.<br\/><br\/>As the Presidential ban applies to the EU as a whole, an EU-wide response is warranted.At the beginning of the month I attended an extraordinary meeting of EU agriculture ministers to discuss the matter. In that regard, I would acknowledge the prompt efforts made by the EU Commission to date to address the immediate problems caused by the market closure, both in the fruit and vegetables and dairy sectors. For Ireland, the expanded timeframe for application of aids to private storage for butter and skimmed milk powder and the extension of this facility to cheese will certainly help to stabilise the situation. My Department is currently working closely with the Irish dairy industry to ensure that it is well placed to avail of the supports. I also welcome the additional allocation of &euro;60 million of EU funding for CAP promotion programmes I hope that these programmes will be targeted at finding replacement markets. <br\/><br\/>I have asked the Commission to continue to monitor the situation closely and to take prompt action, where appropriate. I also made clear at Council that there a number of tools available to us at EU level under the new Common Market regulation which we must be ready to deploy where required and where appropriate.  I have also called on the Commission to increase the advance payment, payable to farmers from 16<sup>th<\/sup>October next under the Direct Payments Scheme from the current 50%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[33828\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the maintenance of a car park (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1192,"content":"<p>The extent of my Department&rsquo;s legal authority in respect of the property in question is not clear from the records currently available.

In particular, my Department has and continues to sponsor relevant research by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) based within the University College Dublin School of Veterinary Medicine. In addition, my Department, together with CVERA, has developed long standing collaborative links with research institutions in Australia, New Zealand and North America and conducts and publishes research on many aspects of tuberculosis surveillance, tuberculin testing and the effectiveness of various policies.

Capturing of badgers takes place in areas where serious outbreaks of TB have been identified in cattle herds and where Department veterinarians have found following an epidemiological examination that badgers are the likely source of infections. <br\/><br\/>In tandem with this, my Department continues to sponsor research and trials into developing a vaccination programme to control TB in badgers, thus improving the overall health status of that species, and break infection link to cattle.

A number of field trials are ongoing with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP05800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP05850"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[33197\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700064#WRP05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of staff who retired, left or otherwise departed from their employment from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013, and the expected annual savings arising therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2014, and the annual expected savings therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2015, and the annual savings therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2016, and the annual savings therefrom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>The number of staff who retired, left or otherwise departed from their employment between 1 July 2013 and 31 December 2013 was 34 (31.20 full time equivalents ), with an expected annual saving of &euro;1,549,035.

Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, are to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc.  These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).  Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<br\/><br\/>Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database.  This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.<br\/><br\/>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>independently-chaired LPIS Appeals Committee<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, as declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, as I already announced, the number of payment entitlements which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower.  This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands. <br\/><br\/>A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process.  This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1275,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[34161\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the balance of 25% payments of the agri-environment option scheme will issue to farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1276,"content":"<p>Area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue.

Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, are to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc.  These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).  Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<br\/><br\/>Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included.  In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.<br\/><br\/>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>independently-chaired LPIS Appeals Committee<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, as declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, as I already announced, the number of payment entitlements which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower. This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands. <br\/><br\/>A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process. This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":1295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ05550"},{"type":"question","counter":1296,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[34473\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700065#WRQ05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the increase that has taken place in employment in agriculture, forestry and marine in the two years to the second quarter of 2014 broken down by NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 regions; the sectors in which this increase has occurred; the causes of this increase; the steps been taken to sustain this increase in employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1297,"content":"<p>The CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) shows that there was an annual increase in employment of 1.7%, or 31,600, in the year to the second quarter of 2014, bringing total employment to 1,901,600.

A total of some 14,936 farmers declare commonage land under the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.<br\/><br\/>They form a significant area of the lands declared annually by farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming the Single Farm Payment, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes, with a<b>pproximately 7%<\/b>of the lands declared are commonage lands. However, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Farming of commonages is a complex matter, with issues about the legal right to claim, in addition to regular disputes about the grazing of the commonages. <br\/><br\/>In the case of the treatment of commonage lands under the 2014 Direct Payment Schemes, the situation remains unchanged. From 2015 onwards, a minimum grazing requirement, equivalent to at least one ewe per 1.5 hectares, will be required of all those applicants declaring marginal lands including commonage under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. A lower grazing level will be fixed for marginal lands where it is necessary on environmental grounds. These requirements will be expected to be met by all claimants by end December 2015. The extent of this task should not be underestimated and my stated intention is that this will be only achieved by working with the farmers concerned and all other stakeholders .<br\/><br\/>With a view to having a system to meet the requirements of the Basic Payment Scheme and Areas of Natural Constraint, which will be implemented in 2015, my Department will be writing to all commonage claimants in the coming weeks setting out their individual grazing requirements for marginal lands .

The new Scheme, to be known as Areas of Natural Constraint, is to be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria, as proposed by the Commission, as follows:<\/p><p>  -  Climate, including Low Temperature and Heat Stress;<\/p><p>  -  Soil, including Drainage, Texture &amp;amp; Stoniness, Rooting Depth and Chemical Properties;<\/p><p>  -  Soil &amp;amp; Climate, including Soil Moisture Deficit (SMD);<\/p><p>-  Terrain, including Slope.   <\/p><p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the three most relevant criteria are SMD (soil saturation), shallow\/stony soils and slopes.   <\/p><p>  An area (administrative unit) would be delineated as an area of Natural Handicap, when it meets the proposed threshold set for one of the above criteria only. The Commission are suggesting the delineation be carried out a LAU2 level &ndash; DED in Ireland&rsquo;s case. To qualify under the new system, an area will need to show that at least two-thirds of its utilised agricultural land meets at least one of these eight criteria.   <\/p><p>  The resultant Areas of Natural Handicap would be subject to a fine-tuning process. These so called Second Stage Criteria are designed to remove areas which, although they meet the biophysical criteria, are deemed to have overcome the natural disadvantage and, therefore, should not benefit under the Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Review is an involved process, and, as such, will take some time to complete. Insofar as Ireland is concerned, our ability to delineate as required was dependent on the completion by Teagasc of their national Soil Survey, which was only recently finalised by Teagasc and officially launched this week. A process will be initiated by my Department of using the relevant data from the soil map, supplemented by climatic data to do the initial delineation. The outcome of this process must be subjected to significant and robust verification giving the importance of an area losing or gaining designation under the ANC Scheme. This verification will include ground truthing. It will be very important to ensure the final decisions are as accurate as possible given that it is not an exact scientific process. There is the provision that a Member State could designate an area up to 10% of its land mass as areas of specific constraints. These could be areas that do not meet the two thirds threshold using one of the 8 criteria but exceeds that threshold when the impact of two criteria is accumulated. In any event, an appeals process will have to be in place to deal with appeals from any area that was not designated where it considers that it should have been. The delineation process is, therefore, likely to take some time before it is finally concluded.   <\/p><p>  The ANC Scheme will be introduced in 2015 and will be subject to the provisions of the new RD Regulation (1305\/2013). Pending the outcome of the Review and the implementation of the new designations, the aid can continue to be paid to farmers situated in the existing Less Favoured Areas pending the new delineation using the bio-physical criteria. It has provisionally being decided that the ANC Scheme will have a funding of &euro;195 million per annum, which is the same as the 2013 and 2014 level of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Policy","counter":1324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[34484\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if it is permissible for farmers at present to be receiving payments under both the REP scheme or the AEOS scheme and the Burren farming for conservation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>Participants in receipt of payments under the Burren Farming for Conservation Scheme may also participate in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme or the Agri-Enviro nment Options Scheme.

This draft will now form the basis for a period of discussion with the Commission and the subsequent formal adoption of the RDP. Finalising the details of each scheme and securing approval for the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will be a priority for my Department in the coming months. It&rsquo;s important to note that the RDP is of course co-funded by the European Commission and therefore all decisions on scheme design and implementation must be taken jointly with them. The role of the carbon navigator in emphasising the credibility of the B eef Data and Genomics Programme scheme to the European Commission will be crucial in helping to secure their support for the implementation of the scheme.  The SWOT a nalysis conducted as part of the Rural Development programming process clearly identified opportunities to build on Ireland&rsquo;s green reputation internat ionally , and to capitalise on our   high levels of carbon efficiency. At the same time, due to our high dependence on animal productio   n systems, there are pressures to further reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector and to meet binding emission reduction targets established under the EU Effort Sharing Decision. <\/p><p>  These opportunities and threats identified in the SWOT analysis are addressed through a variety of measures in the RDP, including the addition of the Carbon N avigator to the proposed Knowledge Transfe r Groups and the Beef Data and G enomics Programme (BDGP) . The Carbon Navigator, developed by Teagasc and Bord Bia , allows   farmers to understand how their farms produce greenhouse gases, identify mitigation capacity, and set targets and a pathway to reduce emissions. I believe the Carbon Navigator has a very positive contribution to make by bringing the science of climate change mitigation down to the level of the farm in a user friendly format. Crucially it also underlines the link between improving farm profit margins and climate change actions. The Carbon Navigator clearly demonstrates, to the farmer, the considerable economic savings that can be achieved through climate change mitigation actions such as a longer grazing season or increased calving rates. <\/p><p>  The cost calculations developed for both the Knowledge Transfer groups and the BDGP are based on the cost incurred and income foregone for farmers involved in these measures. Under EU rules, and in line with good budgetary management, it is precluded from paying farmers for doing the same activity under two separate schemes. Given that all farmers in the Beef Knowledge Transfer groups will also be required to be in the Beef Data and Genomics Programme, there is a risk of double funding if the cost of the Carbon Navigator is included in the cost calculations under both measures. Therefore, the Carbon Navigator is only included in the cost calculation under the Knowledge Transfer Groups. Having said that, it is important to emphasise that the proposal still remains to grant &euro;80 per animal for each set of actions carried out under the BDGP. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1330,"content":"<p>Question No. 482 answered with Question No. 434.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1331,"content":"<p>Question No. 483 answered with Question No. 472.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Administration","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1333,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[34510\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ensure that there are sufficient planners in place to prepare GLAS plans for commonage areas; the method by which the shareholders will be expected to agree and select a planner for the development of a GLAS plan for farmers with commonage holdings; if public procurement rules will apply as these contracts could involve the preparation of over 100 individual GLAS plans for the individual shareholders in the same commonage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1334,"content":"<p>My officials have held meetings with the Agricultural Consultants Association and with Teagasc regarding the preparation of GLAS Commonage Management P lans and   I believe there should be a sufficient complement of agricultural advisors available to carry out this important work.

In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, as I already announced ,the number of payment entitlements which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower. This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands. <br\/><br\/>A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process. This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.<br\/><br\/>To date, some 2,485 farmers have had retrospective clawbacks imposed arising from the system review, of whom 185 had clawbacks imposed for two years, 285 for three years and 1,855 for four years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR03800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Eligibility","counter":1349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1350,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[34530\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700066#WRR03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the upgrading of cattle and sheep housing will be included under the TAMS schemes 2014-2020; if these upgrades will include upgrades to ensure better animal welfare and effluent control and safety issues; if, in relation to animal welfare, it will include the provision of cow mats and slat mats, which significantly improve animal health, productivity and performance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1351,"content":"<p>The Rural Development Programme for the 2014-2020 period was submitted to the EU Commission for approval in July 2014.

An agreement between the world&rsquo;s two major trading blocs has the potential to increase growth and grow jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. In the agri-food sector we have strong offensive interests, both in terms of market access and in eliminating some of the irritants that hinder trade. We are seeking substantial market access for our dairy products and in the prepared foods area. We also want to see action to action to address the question of Grade A equivalence for dairy and the licensing system that applies to dairy imports into the US. <\/p><p>  Of course we have sensitivities as well. One of these is our beef sector. While we see some opportunities for establishing a niche market in the US for Irish beef, we have concerns regarding the prospect of increased beef imports into the EU. I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions with the EU Commission. I have proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s sensitivities are reflected in the size and composition of any quota offered to the US. I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts. I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and I have argued that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.   <\/p><p>  The most recent report of the European Parliament on the trade implications of the EU US trade bears out these Irish concerns in relation to the suckler cow herd in Europe which it finds will be adversely affected by the trade deal. In my meetings with the new Agriculture Commissioner I will continue to outline our concerns and seek mitigating measures in relation to the beef sector.   <\/p><p>  I would make one final point about suggestions made in some quarters that the EU might grant access to hormone treated beef from the US as part of these negotiations. It is true that the US has said it is seeking access for its hormone treated meat to the EU. However, a decision was taken many years ago to ban the use of hormones in animals in the EU destined for the human food chain. The decision arose from a long series of upsetting reports linking hormone treated meat to birth deformities. The ban forms part of the EU positive but precautionary principle to limit the use of medical treatments to disease prevention and cure and it is impossible in the current climate to see a reversal of the EU decision.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700067#WRS02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1417,"content":"<p>Question No. 515 answered with Question No. 434.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Parcel Identification System","counter":1418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700067#WRS03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1419,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[34714\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700067#WRS03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a land parcel identification system review has been carried out on a person (details supplied) in County Galway; if so, the over-claim that has been applied in the case and the scheme years this over-claim applies to; if a penalty has been applied; if so, the scheme years the penalties apply to; the percentage penalty involved; if any payment under the 2013 single payment scheme has issued to the person in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1420,"content":"<p>The land declared by the person named was subject to the comprehensive review of all land parcel data maintained on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System.

It is also a review of their past medical history in order to determine whether there is evidence of any condition, though dormant at the time of examination, which could be precipitated again by the robust nature of life in the Permanent Defence Force, with all its associated stresses.<\/p><p>  Medical evidence reveals that a history of a psychiatric illness may be of a recurring nature.  The employer in taking on an individual with a history of psychiatric illness incurs an additional duty of care to ensure the individual is not exposed within the work environment to any factor which could precipitate a recurrence of the condition.  This imposes restrictions on the employer with regard to placements which would not be appropriate in the context of military service, which can be both physically and mentally demanding.  Physical and medical standards for entry to the Permanent Defence Force are based on the professional advice of the Medical Corps and have regard to the challenging nature of the job, the duties of military service and the training exercises undertaken by members of the Permanent Defence Force.    I am advised by the Military Authorities that within the context of the operational needs and demands of the Defence Forces, that medical decisions are arrived at with the well being of the candidate being the primary concern. <\/p><p>  All potential recruits are advised when they are called for their medical examination that they can bring relevant medical reports to their medical examination if they so wish.  I am satisfied with the current recruitment arrangements in the Permanent Defence Force and I have no plans to change them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1463,"qnumday":531,"qnumall":"[33201\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of staff who retired, left or otherwise departed from their employment from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013, and the expected annual savings arising therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2014, and the annual expected savings therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2015, and the annual savings therefrom; the number of staff expected to leave in 2016, and the annual savings therefrom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1464,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[33218\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of new staff employed since 1 July 2013 up to 31 December 2013 and the expected annual costs arising therefrom; the expected number to be employed in 2014 and the estimated annual cost arising therefrom; the expected number to be employed in 2015 and the estimated annual cost arising therefrom; the expected number to be employed in 2016 and the estimated annual cost arising therefrom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1465,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 532 together.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a moratorium in place on recruitment across the civil and public service since 2009.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  <br\/><br\/>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers.  <br\/><br\/>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces. <br\/><br\/>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings. <br\/><br\/>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:-<br\/><br\/>-  Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.<br\/><br\/>-  Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<br\/><br\/>-  Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<br\/><br\/>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. I understand that discussions are taking place with the Representative Association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<br\/><br\/>The need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas, is an issue of which I need to be cognisant.It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place. <br\/><br\/>However, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council and it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on the matter at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NATO Membership","counter":1469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1470,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[33875\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700068#WRT01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the numbers of Irish politicians or public officials attending the NATO summit, including Army officers as observers; and the cost of the attendance which will be bourn by the Irish Exchequer.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1471,"content":"<p>As Ireland is not a member of NATO, the question of attendance at the NATO Summit did not arise. <\/p><p>  In accordance with usual practice, an invitation was extended to the Taoiseach to attend a meeting which took place on 4 September between NATO Heads of State and Government and non-NATO countries that contribute to the UN mandated and NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan.  I attended this meeting accompanied by a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p><p>  A total of four officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade attended meetings for Partners which were held in advance of the Summit.

An example of this was the introduction by the Government in July 2011 of the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme.  This Programme allows nationals of eighteen visa-required countries who are in possession of a UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the need for an Irish visa as well.  This initiative has led to an increase in visits from those countries of 68% between 2010, the last full year before its introduction, and 2013.<\/p><p>  Building on the success of that Programme, my Department and I are continuing to work with the UK Home Office on the introduction of the British Irish Visa Scheme.<\/p><p>  The overall grant rate for Irish visa applications is 91% which compares very favourably worldwide.  The number of visa applications to Ireland has steadily grown over the last four years and is on course to reach 100,000 for the first time this year.  For example, applications in our Abu Dhabi Visa Office (which covers the entire Gulf Region) have increased by 139% since 2011.  The equivalent figures for our New Delhi and Beijing Visa Offices are 16% and 19% respectively, despite the impact of the Visa Waiver Programme, and the fact that there are no direct flights from either country to Ireland.  <\/p><p>  In terms of processing times, the average of 9 days for the processing of applications from date of payment of the fee in our overseas visa offices (excluding our Abuja office which deals with a higher proportion of long-stay visa applications which are more complex) also compares favourably with competitor countries.

The Commission noted that delays occurring between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually in the intending purchaser's interest, e.g. to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there are any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any legislative changes to reform the legal framework within which gazumping can occur.  <\/p><p>  The issue was subsequently considered by the Auctioneering\/Estate Agency Review Group in its 2005 Report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  The nature of the Scheme is that it is demand-led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and prosecutions of cases through the courts systems. This makes it difficult to anticipate and control costs. Under the Act an applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  <br\/><br\/>A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including the transferring of responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute in cases of abuse.  Provisions to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard for a person's right to the presumption of innocence,  to a fair trial and to be given legal aid where appropriate.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><br\/><br\/>An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act and consequently the information sought by the Deputy in respect of the number of persons who received criminal legal aid on more than one occasion is not available.

For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers on a full board basis. RIA currently provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to just over 4,300 persons in 34 centres across the State. It should be noted that the number of new asylum seekers to date in 2014 is approximately 40% higher than the same period in 2013. <\/p><p>  The average length of stay within the system is currently 4 years. In this regard, a significant factor impacting on time spent in direct provision is legal proceedings initiated by many protection applicants in relation to decisions on their applications for protection in the State. It should be noted that there are about 1,350 judicial review cases in the Courts related to asylum and immigration matters. When account is taken of other family members the best estimate is that these judicial reviews impact on some 2,000 persons in the protection system, the majority of whom are residing in the direct provision system.  A recent analysis revealed that approximately 50% of persons in the direct provision system have either judicial review applications pending, are the subject of deportation orders, or are seeking leave to remain in the State for non-protection reasons. <\/p><p>  That said, I acknowledge that applicants are in the system too long and that steps must be taken to deal with that. Accordingly, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single procedure is a key step towards removing the structural delays which are a  feature of our existing protection system.  As the Deputy may be aware the Statement of Government priorities  2014-2016 commits to the introduction of a separate Protection Bill to include provision for a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection. This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time that applicants spend in the direct provision system. Work on the Bill has commenced and the intention is to have the new legislation enacted by April, 2015. <\/p><p>  The Government has also committed to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements with the protection process, including direct provision, and supports for asylum seekers. The Working Group will be established in the near future and it is expected that it will report to Government by year end.<\/p><p>  In relation to the other statistical information sought, it is important to state that RIA is keen to provide as much detail as is practicable on the system which it is charged with operating. Extensive statistical information is on its website - www.ria.gov.ie including Annual Reports covering the years from 2007 to 2013 inclusive. These Annual Reports provide a variety of information, including a breakdown of the numbers of adults and children in each direct provision centre, details of the number of family units and the length of time persons, overall, have been residing in the direct provision system.

Where sections 6A and 6B of that Act are applicable, a child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship if, at the time of the birth of the child, one of his or her parents had, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence. Entitlement of a child born in the State to Irish citizenship is determined by making an application for an Irish passport on behalf of the child to the Passport Office. However entitlement to Irish citizenship under Section 6(3) is determined by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, as is the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children born in Northern Ireland of certain foreign nationals.<\/p><p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. Since 2010, just over 1,000 such applications have been approved. This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.<\/p><p>  In addition, certificates of nationality were issued in respect of 3 cases in 2012, 4 cases in 2013 and 7 cases in 2014. A certificate of nationality issued to a person is evidence that they were, as of the date of issue, an Irish citizen. The cases in question were referred to the Citizenship Division for consideration in respect of children born in the State. I can inform the Deputy that a formal liaison arrangement between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which was agreed earlier this year and has been put in place, will provide a mechanism for dealing with exceptional cases as well as ongoing consultation in relation to citizenship and passport matters in general. <\/p><p>  As indicated in the Ombudsman's Report  my Department is working with the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation to evaluate the potential for streamlining the system dealing with the employment and immigration status of non-EEA workers.  At present two entirely separate application processes are required.  This evaluation is at an early stage.  It will be informed also by a consultancy project commencing shortly in respect of a business process review of the Employment Permits System.  <\/p><p>  The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and that remit was significantly extended under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. However, after careful consideration of all the issues involved, it was determined that the administration of the law relating to immigration or naturalisation, should not be within the scope of the Ombudsman. Not least in this debate was the fact that there are already a significant number of appeal processes built into the system including Judicial Reviews. That said, the matter will be kept under review.  I should also add that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has administrative arrangements in place with the Office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700070#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700070#WRV02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1655,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[33574\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700070#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the presence of armed garda&iacute; at Mount Trenchard direct provision centre in County Limerick and the transfer of two spokespersons for the residents immediately after their talks with the management of the centre; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1656,"content":"<p>The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp;amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the government policy of direct provision and dispersal.

Such reasons may be to facilitate medical treatments, to provide more spacious accommodation for growing families, to  more appropriately provide for a disability and so on.

Currently, 4,311 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.<br\/><br\/>In relation to complaints by residents and by centre staff of direct provision centres under contract to the RIA, these are dealt with in accordance with the revised RIA House Rules and Procedures which are available in several languages on the RIA website at www.ria.gov.ie  A copy of these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre.  <br\/><br\/>Experience has shown that, given the nature and the number of such complaints, they are best resolved by informal discussion between residents and management at a local level.  Where more serious complaints arise, residents have the right to lodge a formal written complaint with centre management and, if the issue remains unresolved, residents can take the complaint to RIA. The Rules also allow for direct referral to RIA in certain circumstances.  It is important to note that if a complaint is made in respect of a decision made by a particular RIA official, the appeal is not dealt with by that official. The complaints system contained in these House Rules is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.  <br\/><br\/>The issue of an independent complaints mechanism featured greatly in the discussions which led to the revised House Rules and Procedures (which apply in all RIA asylum seeker accommodation centres) which was introduced in 2010 and referred to above.<br\/><br\/>The Review Group, whose function was to review House Rules and Procedures which had been in place since 2002, had an independent Chairman and had representation from NGO&rsquo;s (including the Irish Refugee Council and the Refugee Information Service), the Health Service Executive, RIA, Centre Management and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Group met on thirteen occasions and a subgroup also met with residents and local NGO&rsquo;s in four accommodation centres.  <br\/><br\/>It was RIA's view, arising from the discussions within the Review Group,  that no clear model was cited during these discussions as to what an independent complaints mechanism would look like, or how it could be implemented without undue cost and bureaucracy.  The system of direct provision exists within its own circumstances and RIA is satisfied that the structure of the complaints procedure contained within the revised House Rules is fair and is broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the above, the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 includes a commitment to &quot;<i>...establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements with the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers&quot;.<\/i>My intention is to proceed with the establishment of that Working Group in the near future whose mandate will include reporting back to Government on improvements in relation to direct provision.

Currently, 4,311 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.<\/p><p>  RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  RIA is, and will always be, compliant with all legislative requirements in this area. RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver,coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory functions in this area.<\/p><p>  A key feature of the Irish system of accommodating asylum seekers is that services are &lsquo;mainstreamed&rsquo;.  Social Work supports for children and vulnerable adults in centres are thus provided through HSE\/Tusla on the same basis as for children and vulnerable adults in the wider community. Centre staff are provided with training and with any guidance needed on a day-to-day basis by the Child &amp;amp; Family Services Unit in RIA.<\/p><p>  In addition to the standard accommodation services and supports provided through Direct Provision accommodation centres, both RIA and other State service providers, particularly the HSE and Tusla, link in with those centres to provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.  <\/p><p>  Although parents who live in direct provision centres have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children who reside with them. RIA operates a Child Protection Policy based on Tusla's Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. In each family centre there is a Designated Liaison Person appointed to deal with Child Protection and Welfare concerns. A notice is displayed in all family centres which give the name(s) and contact number(s) of the Designated Contact Person(s) for the centre. All DLPs must have undertaken Children First training, and in almost all centres the Centre Manager is also a DLP.  In larger centres there is more that one DLP.  RIA also encourages the DLPs to source Children First Training for staff who may, in the course of their work, come in direct contact with children i.e. housekeepers, chefs, kitchen staff: all of which is dependent on the availability of training from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla. A more user-friendly version of this policy has been agreed with Tusla and will be published shortly and appropriate training arranged.<\/p><p>   RIA advise that there is no evidence that child protection referrals to Tusla for children in Direct Provision are over the national average or that  there is a disproportionate number of cases under the Child Care Act, 1991 involving such children relative to the population generally.  <\/p><p>  In relation to vulnerable adults, RIA will always act on advice from social workers and medical personnel. In this context it is important to note that RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy compliments other policies and procedures in place designed to protect residents and monitor contractors.;<\/p><p> - the House Rules which set out the rights and obligations on residents and management and each could engage in a complaints mechanism in the event that the other failed in their obligations. The Rules' aim is to ensure that problems are resolved quickly and &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; rather than having to resort to written complaints. Residents, however, can put their complaints in writing and, if unresolved, can be referred upwards to RIA. In certain cases, a first instance complaint can be made directly to RIA.<\/p><p>- Garda vetting policy.

The Office is currently engaged in a review of our approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation of a new updated overall integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants. A Cross Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March to this end with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review. Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration. The Cross Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism.

Any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State seeking asylum in the State, or seeking the protection of the State against persecution, or requesting not to be returned or removed to a particular country, or otherwise indicating an unwillingness to leave the State for fear of persecution can apply to the Minister for a declaration that they are a refugee. Applications for asylum in the State are investigated and determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996. The  vast majority of Syrians who have applied for asylum in Ireland since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria in 2011 have been declared to be refugees. The recognition rate for Iraqi nationals is also comparatively high.<\/p><p>  Our in-country protection system is supplemented by our commitment to the UNHCR resettlement programme. In the case of Syria I would point out that the Government has already committed to accept 90 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict under this programme. This will include four serious medical cases whose medical needs cannot be met except through resettlement. In addition, the Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP), which was introduced following an approach by members of the Syrian community in Ireland, is intended to offer temporary Irish residence - rather than refugee status - to vulnerable persons present in Syria, or who have fled from Syria to surrounding countries since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011, and who have close family members residing in the State.   <\/p><p>  The Programme allowed naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already lawfully resident in the State to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland. All applications received are being examined based on the criteria set out in the programme, a key condition of which is that these persons should not become a burden on the State. Beneficiaries who are admitted under the SHAP programme will be granted permission on a temporary basis for up to two years. This Programme is an additional initiative in response to the crisis in Syria and is without prejudice to other avenues whereby Syrian nationals might lawfully enter the State, such as family reunification for the family members of refugees and persons with subsidiary protection. Such other avenues are of course also open to Iraqi nationals. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I have been discussing the ways in which Ireland can offer refuge to a number of families who have seen their lives devastated by the appalling violence and oppression in Iraq.

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.<br\/><br\/>In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, I must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.<br\/><br\/>This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.<br\/><br\/>The matter of effecting removals from the State is a very complex area and there are many reasons why Deportation Orders may not be enforced. Among these reasons are Judicial Review proceedings taken in the lead up to and often immediately prior to deportation and issues procuring travel documents for certain countries. However, there is no list of countries that the State will not deport to and each individual case is considered on its own merits.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><br\/><br\/>There is no direct correlation between the numbers of Deportation Orders issued and those executed in any particular year.  Since 2009 over 14,000 Orders were made with over 1,500 persons removed during the same period.  It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State (which occurs in many cases) and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law. <br\/><br\/>With regards to persons under the age of 18 years, who were born in the Ireland of Ireland it should be recalled that over 10 years ago a claimed right to reside in Ireland based solely on the birth of a child in Ireland had come to be used as a method of attempting to circumvent normal immigration controls.  In order to address these concerns, a referendum was held in June 2004 to amend the citizenship provisions in the Constitution which was overwhelmingly carried.  This allowed the Oireachtas to deal with the issue of citizenship for children of non-national parents and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 was enacted.This complicates the issue of right to remain for persons under 18, depending on whether they were born before or after the legislative changes.  However, I can say that it is the aim wherever possible to deal with family units together. <br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that, having examined in detail the request for detailed breakdowns of deportation orders made in respect of persons under 18 (born in the island of Ireland) or otherwise, it is not be possible to provide the figures requested.Attempting to do so would mean matching and cross-matching a large number of data sources in such a way that the veracity and reliability of the resulting statistics could not be guaranteed.  In addition, carrying out such an exercise would have a significant impact on the ability of a number of processing units to carry out their day to day work and would divert resources away from the processing of individual cases which is my priority.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law","counter":1805,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1806,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[34037\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a matter regarding legal protection in place to defend home owners (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1807,"content":"<p>The first recourse of any householder faced with an intruder should be, where circumstances permit, to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It recognises in a very practical manner the special constitutional status of an individual&rsquo;s dwelling and makes it clear that a person may use reasonable force to defend themselves in their home.  It allows for the use of such force as is reasonable in the circumstances, to protect people in the dwelling from assault, to protect property, to prevent the commission of a crime, or to make a lawful arrest. <br\/><br\/>The Act -<br\/><br\/>-  extends the right to use such reasonable force to the curtilage of the dwelling,<br\/><br\/>-  explicitly provides that a person attacked in the home is not required to retreat, and<br\/><br\/>-  provides that a person who uses such reasonable force cannot be sued by a intruder in respect of any injury, loss or damage arising from it.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 of the Act sets out the criteria for  use of reasonable force by a householder against an intruder entering the dwelling with criminal intent.The householder must believe that the intruder has entered the dwelling to commit a criminal act.  The force used against the intruder must only be such as is reasonable in the circumstances as the householder believes them to be, to protect people in the dwelling from assault, to protect property, to prevent the commission of a crime or to make a lawful arrest.  Section 2(4) provides that it is a matter for a court or jury to decide whether the householder's belief with regard to the amount of force used was honestly held and provides as follows:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><i>It is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held but in considering whether the person using the force honestly held the belief, the court or jury, as the case may be, shall have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for so believing and all other relevant circumstances.<\/i><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The Act achieves the correct balance in providing protections to the householder.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":1808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1809,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[34047\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the residency status in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1810,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, if the person has made an application for asylum or subsidiary protection, the position is that it is not the practice to comment on such applications for so long as they are in the protection process.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1811,"content":"<p>Question No. 650 answered with Question No. 647.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1813,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[34090\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current residency status in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 2; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1814,"content":"<p>This applicant arrived in the State on 2 October 2005, having been granted a study visa, before applying for asylum on 6 November 2006.

For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers on a full board basis. RIA currently provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to just over 4,300 persons in 34 centres across the State.  It is of note that the number of new asylum seekers to date in 2014 is approximately 40% higher than the same period in 2013.<br\/><br\/>In relation to statistical queries such as these, it is important to state that RIA is keen to provide as much detail as is practicable on the system which it is charged with operating.  Extensive statistical information is on its website -<i>www.ria.gov.ie <\/i>including Annual Reports covering the years from 2007 to 2013 inclusive. These Annual Reports provide a variety of information, including a breakdown of the numbers of adults and children in each direct provision centre and the length of time persons, overall, have been residing in the direct provision system.This is also provided on a centre by centre basis, and the counties in which these centres are located, including Waterford, are identified in these reports.<br\/><br\/>Information in relation to the number of children born to parents in direct provision  is not readily available. RIA will investigation whether this information can be garnered and will convey the information to the Deputy in due course. <br\/><br\/>In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for international protection and who seek accommodation until such time as they leave voluntarily; are removed - either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer; are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or are granted permission to remain in the State on some other basis.  There is therefore no immediate year on year correlation between the numbers residing in direct provision accommodation centres and the number of asylum applications processed. Nonetheless, details of the yearly processing of asylum claims by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner are available on its Annual Reports published on its website - <i>www.orac.ie.<\/i><br\/><br\/>More generally, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed. The Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 includes a commitment to reduce the length of time the applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single applications procedure, to be introduced by way of a Protection Bill as a matter of priority.  Moreover, there is a further commitment to establish an Independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements with the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.

In addition, there were 784 cells which accommodated 2 prisoners, 111 cells which accommodated 3 prisoners and 31 cells which accommodated 4 or more prisoners. As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals. The Deputy will appreciate, that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommendations in those prisons with the highest levels of over-crowding, namely Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and the Dochas Centre.<\/p><p>  It is clear, given the current number of prisoners in custody, that the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners at this time.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of approximately 3,200 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety. It should be borne in mind that in certain cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity. Family members and friends  often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1864,"content":"<p>Question No. 669 answered with Question No. 663.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":1865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX05950"},{"type":"question","counter":1866,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[34538\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700072#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a substantive answer will be given to a letter written to her some time ago;

The current process for the appointment of judges in Ireland is set out in sections 12 to 17 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<br\/><br\/>Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to the Minister for Justice and Equality the names of the persons whom it recommends for appointment.  The Minister then brings the names to Government.  Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge. <br\/><br\/>A review of the current procedures for appointment to judicial office is ongoing in my Department and a public consultation was initiated in December 2013. The submissions to the review are currently being given detailed consideration in my Department.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the Court of Appeal, on 25 February 2014 the Government announced a serving Judge of the High Court, the Hon. Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan as President Designate of the Court of Appeal. On 23 July 2014 the Government announced 6 serving judges of the High Court as Judges designate of that Court, of which four were male and two were female. Formal nominations for appointment to the Court of Appeal will take place once the Court has been established. <br\/><br\/>Six Specialist Judges of the Circuit Court were appointed on 15 July 2013. Applications for these posts were made through the JAAB and eligibility to apply was confined to serving County Registrars. Of the persons appointed as Specialist Judges four were female and two were male.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the figures in the following tables, there are three vacancies on the High Court to which the Government has made nominations and the appointments are due to be made by the President shortly.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><b>Judges Appointed 2010 to 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Supreme Court<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>High Court<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Circuit Court<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>District Court <\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><\/table><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><b>Judges Appointed to the Supreme Court 2010 to 2014 - Former occupation<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Junior Counsel<\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Senior Counsel<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Solicitor<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Serving Judge<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1*<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Appointment of the Hon.

They are given the following options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.  In addition, persons are also entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  <\/p><p>  A Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.  The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.<\/p><p>  In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, I must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.<\/p><p>  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  <\/p><p>  The percentage of asylum cases determined that have resulted to date in the issue of deportations orders in respect of 2011 was 24%, 10.7% in 2012 and 6.8% in 2013.   It should be noted that the variations in these figures are primarily related to the process leading up to making of a deportation order.  Following the stage when persons are refused asylum, they can then apply for Subsidiary Protection and thereafter Leave to Remain. It is only on completion of all of these steps that the deportation order is made.  Thus when the process is completed the likelihood is that the number of deportation orders in respect of asylum applications determined in the years in question will be significantly increased. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1898,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1899,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[34643\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will introduce legislation in the near future (details supplied) regarding sex trafficking and exploitation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1900,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[34854\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding prostitution; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1901,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 687 and 703 together.<br\/><br\/>There is already legislation in place to address trafficking for the purpose of sex and those organising prostitution or  living off the earnings of prostitutes. <br\/><br\/>The Deputies' questions appear to refer to the Justice Committee's &quot;Report on hearings and submissions on the Review of Legislation on Prostitution&quot;. <br\/><br\/>I am examining the recommendations made by the Justice Committee, the advices of the Attorney General and the views of the Minister for Health regarding a new approach to prostitution legislation. <br\/><br\/>When I have had the opportunity to complete consideration of the issues, proposals will be brought to Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1902,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1903,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[34653\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will appoint the board of the National Disability Authority; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1904,"content":"<p>The Chair designate of the Authority is meeting with the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality today and I expect to be in a position to make a formal announcement in relation to the appointment of the board shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Maintenance Issues","counter":1905,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY02025"},{"type":"question","counter":1906,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[34697\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700073#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will investigate the delays in acknowledgements and responses of other countries in relation to the maintenance recovery section with specific reference to a person (details supplied).","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1907,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases that may be or have been the subject of an application under the UN Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance. <\/p><p>  Such applications are facilitated by the Irish Central Authority for International Maintenance Recovery which is located in my Department.

A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage.<\/p><p>  At present, the average duration of imprisonment as a result of a life sentence, based on those who have been granted temporary release from prison to date, is approximately 18 years.  Of course, it must be noted that this is an average and many prisoners subject to a life sentence will be detained for a longer duration.<\/p><p>  While I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a specific minimum term of imprisonment for murder, I intend to keep the matter under review.<\/p><p>  The offence of manslaughter does not attract a mandatory penalty but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  The superior courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families. The initiative led by the judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website is welcomed.<\/p><p>  A Penal Policy Review Group was established in September 2012 by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter T.D. The Group was asked to undertake an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including the role of penal policy in crime prevention, sentencing policy, alternatives to custody, prison accommodation and regimes, supports for reintegration and rehabilitation, and the issue of female offenders.  The Group has completed its deliberations and recently submitted its final report to me.

The SCP is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving.<br\/><br\/>Since its establishment on 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. <br\/><br\/>Details of the allocations to the School Completion Programmes since 2011 are as follows,<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Annual Allocation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;30.256m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;28.256m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;26.456m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;24.756m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE).

These savings required are reflected in the allocations to the programmes in those years.<br\/><br\/>The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to the Child and Family Agency for the  School Completion Programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the annual estimates and budgetary processes having regard to the resources available to the Government.<br\/><br\/>The planned programme review of SCP indicated in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure has commenced.

The review process is being overseen by a steering committee which includes officials of the Child and Family Agency and my Department and officials from the Department of Education and Skills.<br\/><br\/>The review findings will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the SCP programme on a sustainable footing for the future and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.

If the parent wishes to enrol that child in the following school year for the balance of the unused capitation entitlement, they will have to make application  to my Department and when the circumstances are considered permission may be granted to allow the child to enrol again and avail of the unused free pre-school complement. <\/p><p>  It is not clear from the questions submitted what the circumstances are that the Deputy is referring to, but the Early Years Policies and Programmes unit in my Department will clarify any issues or concerns that parents have in relation to the implementation of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700074#WRZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1995,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700074#WRZ04650"},{"type":"question","counter":1996,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[33298\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700074#WRZ04700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of applications that have been made to the courts in every calendar year since 1 August 2012 to have legal costs services related to the representation of guardians ad litem taxed or measured as provided for in sections 25 (4), 26 (2) and 26 (2C) of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Overall, 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co.

This strategy gives a mandate for the commissioning of evidence based parenting support programmes in all 17 local areas.  The Agency funds a range of parenting support services including Parenting Programmes, Parent and Toddler services, Springboard Projects, Parentline, Marte Meo model,Lone Parent Services and Treoir, Teen Parent Support Programmes through various entities including the large network of Family Resource Centres. In 2013, Family Resource Centres facilitated almost 140 positive parenting programmes. Many of theses programmes have been evaluated.<br\/><br\/>The theme of Positive Parenting is specifically addressed in many evidence based parenting programmes. Supporting children&rsquo;s self-discipline and behaviour with a &lsquo;learning&rsquo; strategy rather than a &lsquo;punishment&rsquo; strategy is strongly and effectively advocated by many Parenting Support Programmes (for example the Lifestart Growing Child Programme, a home-based programme for parents of children aged from birth to five years).<br\/><br\/>The Agency has also launched a &quot;50 Key Messages&quot; document as part of the Parenting Support Strategy which is an evidence informed guide for parents and practitioners of key messages that are important for raising children well.  Central to this are 31 key messages that deal with parenting of children across the lifecourse - from &lsquo;preparing for parenthood&rsquo; through to parenting teenagers.  One of the key messages is that &lsquo;a Positive Parenting Style Works&rsquo;.  The Agency is currently incorporating these 31 key messages into a user-friendly branded section () of its website which will be launched shortly. This will be followed up by a number of related initiatives including practitioner and parent training, parental participation projects and the recruitment of parenting support champions.  These initiatives will be monitored and evaluated along with other family support work. <br\/><br\/>Parenting Support can be formal, semi-formal or informal. Parents are made aware of the courses provided in FRCs through various means including local advertising, newsletters, leaflet drops and word of mouth. Some may be identified through their attendance at other services and activities provided within an FRC or through referrals from other support services.The Child and Family Agency website www.tusla.ie also information for parents with regard to positive parenting  .<br\/><br\/>Central to the Child and Family Agency's understanding of positive parenting is the importance of a positive approach in the day to day care and education of our children.  The style of parenting that is used is important and has a significant impact on children&rsquo;s development, how they feel about themselves and the world around them.  It can be as important to their long-term well-being as nutrition and physical exercise. Research indicates that adopting a positive parenting style results in children being happier, healthier, enjoying their learning and being able to make friends.<br\/><br\/>Supports for parents around &lsquo;Parenting Positively&rsquo; are part of an integrated approach to improving children and family well-being and improving outcomes.  Supporting parents is recognised as a key element of this collective work and described as a &lsquo;transformational goal&rsquo; in the recently published National Policy Framework for Children and Young People.

The Inter-Departmental Group&rsquo;s Report, which I published on the 16th July, has served to stimulate and further inform public debate on these important matters. The work of the Inter-Departmental Group concentrated on the potentially most salient records which were accessible in the time available so as to inform Government's considerations of the scope and format of the Commission of Investigation.<\/p><p>  The Report acknowledges the need to learn from the experience and lessons of previous statutory inquiries. It is my view that our approach should have regard to the facts established through recent inquiries into related institutions, and the general experience gained in conducting similar investigations into matters of public importance. <\/p><p>  Given the breadth and complexity of the issues involved it is clear that comprehensive and precise terms of reference are required to ensure the Commission is set up on the most sound footing possible. The investigation needs to be broad enough and inclusive enough to give us an understanding of the issues but precise enough to facilitate completion in a timely and cost effective way. This is a complex task and it is appropriate to take the necessary time for detailed consultation and drafting. To do otherwise would not be in the best interests of the mothers and children most concerned or serve the wider public interest.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the specific question of criminal investigations,  the Act obliges the Commission to report to the Minister and if the report reveals issues of concern which are potentially criminal in nature, these will of course be referred to the appropriate investigative and prosecution authorities. <\/p><p>  I wish to again acknowledge the constructive contribution of opposition spokespersons and Deputies on both sides of the House with whom I have met.

It recommends, broadly, a move away from the traditional institutional based model of care to a more patient-centred, flexible and community based service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced while still providing in-patient care, as appropriate.  This Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change,<\/i>and has significantly progressed this through the provision of &euro;90m since 2012 to underpin a range of new services initiatives to meet this widely agreed strategy objective.<br\/><br\/>As indicated in<i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, the key responsibility for the care of people with addiction lies with Primary Care Services, to include appropriate liaison with Mental Health services.<br\/><br\/>In this context, I am satisfied that there exists appropriate cooperation between HSE Mental Health Services, Addiction Services, Drug Task Forces and other Community and Voluntary agencies to deliver the type of services raised by the Deputies.  This includes provision of specific funding by the Executive to a number of voluntary service providers that treat drug and alcohol disorders. <br\/><br\/>The responsibility of community mental health services includes responding to the needs of people with mental illness, and an addiction. Acute presentation by service users with co-morbid mental health and addiction problems are recommended to be seen by General Adult Community Mental Health Teams or, if needs be, by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), which provides acute secondary care interventions in the community. <br\/><br\/>There are currently 115 General Adult Community Mental Health Teams. <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>recommends that there should be 92 to service the population (i.e. 1 per 50,000).  The reconfiguration and development of these teams are continuing, in line with <i>A Vision For Change<\/i>recommendations.  There are currently 62 CAMHS Teams, representing  an increase of 4 on the same period last year. In addition, there are also 3 CAMHS Day Hospital Teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. Of relevance also, is the fact that there are currently 24 Psychiatry of Old Age Teams, an increase of 2 over last year.<br\/><br\/>In the overall context<i>, A Vision for Change <\/i>recommends the provision of specialist community mental health teams for those with complex and enduring mental illness, together with co-morbid substance abuse issues. The focus of the HSE is to develop the General Adult, Psychiatry of Old Age, and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Team structures nationally, including that potentially relating to those with co-morbid substance abuse problems. The HSE Mental Health Division recognises the obvious need for effective liaison between Primary Care, and Community Mental Health Teams. It is intended that these links will be strengthened, as additional staffing is recruited. <br\/><br\/>The National Drug Treatment Centre, based in Trinity Court in Dublin, also provides a Specialist Dual Diagnosis service for people affected by both Mental Illness and Addiction.  Its programmes are available for the greater Dublin region, and to certain other areas, as required. It also provides a Young Persons Programme (YPP), which has proved very successful over the last number of years.<br\/><br\/>As capacity is expanded within Community Mental Health Teams nationally, in conjunction with enhancing Clinical Programmes, the HSE Mental Health Division will consider further development of specific specialised resources.  In 2014, the focus is on building on investment in Mental Health Intellectual Disability (MHID), Liaison, and the Homeless with mental health issues, as well as improvements to the more generic community mental health teams. <br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the various pressures and difficulties being faced by the health and personal social services overall, I am satisfied that the HSE is maximising its efforts to provide a  more co-ordinated approach to the type of services raised by the Deputies. This will be improved, as appropriate, in the future in the context of progressing wider health service reforms whether at national or local level. If the Deputies have specific concerns about services at local level, this should be raised with the HSE in the first instance, which has statutory operational responsibilities for resolving particular issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700077#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education","counter":2183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700077#WRCC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2184,"qnumday":787,"qnumall":"[33035\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700077#WRCC01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason Meath disability service is due to cease funding for the preschool assistant service; if he will reconsider this decision taking into consideration the huge support this subsidy has provided for over ten years to parents of children with disabilities attending preschools; the support, if any, in place if this funding is to cease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2185,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, provides for a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.

Gross  income, in respect of the over 70's medical card scheme refers to total basic income prior to any or all deductions being made. The system of assessment for those 70 years of age and over is based on significantly higher gross income limits of &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014, as set out in  legislation, compared to the standard net income thresholds of &euro;184 for a single person or &euro;266.50 for a couple. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this age cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. There are no proposals to change this assessment process.<br\/><br\/>However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the standard means test where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs. This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70's gross income thresholds.  <br\/><br\/>Persons aged 70 or over, who have lost eligibility for a medical card due to the 2014 budgetary change will continue to have access to free GP services. In addition, as you will be aware, the Government committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service for the entire population and the aim is to have the over 70's phase implemented this year or early next year. Furthermore, any person over 70 that does not qualify for a medical card is able to use the DPS (Drugs Payment Scheme) which caps spending on prescription drugs. <br\/><br\/>The HSE local health offices can offer assistance to those completing their Medical Card\/GP Visit Card application form or seek clarification on any aspect regarding the process of assessing eligibility for a Medical Card\/GP Visit Card.

The level of funding provided in the Drugs Initiative since 2008 has changed significantly, due to the transfer of &euro;19.9m in respect of the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund to the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2009 and more recently the transfer of &euro;21.57m from the Vote of my Department to the HSE in relation to Task Force treatment and rehabilitation projects on 1 January 2014.This year, a total of &euro;7.381m has been provided in the Drugs Initiative of which &euro;6.6m has been allocated to Task Force projects.<br\/><br\/>In recent years the nature and scale of drug misuse has changed due to the increasing geographical dispersal of problem drug use (including heroin use), the increased prevalence of polydrug use, the increased strength of cannabis, and the emergence of new psychoactive substances.The response of the HSE has involved the re-orientation of its addiction services towards polydrug issues, using a 4-tiered model approach as a national framework through which to deliver services.<br\/><br\/>I would like to point out that cross-departmental provision for Drugs Programmes has been maintained at very significant levels since 2008.In 2014, a total of &euro;240.135m has been allocated for drugs programmes and initiatives across Government departments and agencies, representing a reduction of approximately 13% on expenditure levels in 2008.  In the context of the resource constraints arising from the economic crisis, this level of funding emphasises the Government's ongoing commitment to the implementation of the NDS, with the overall policy objective of targeting resources at areas where there is the highest concentration of drugs activity.

Recommendations, such as the use of guidelines and asthma education training, are already underway. <br\/><br\/>Asthma management involves a partnership between the patient and the relevant health care professional, with frequent revision and reinforcement.  The aim is to give patients (and parents\/caregivers), where possible, the ability to control their own (or their child&rsquo;s) asthma condition, with guidance from health care professionals.  For this reason, education of patients to ensure self-management and patient empowerment is an integral and fundamental part of the Model of Care and at all points of contact with the health services. <br\/><br\/>The role of the health care professional is key to the education and empowerment of patients, so that patients are well informed, guided by the professional and confident in self-management of their asthma.  The role of GPs, practice nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals in encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their own care needs to be clearly articulated, in both education and practice.<br\/><br\/>Like adults, children with asthma (and their parents) need to know how to self-manage their own condition.  Guided self-management education, including self-monitoring of peak expiratory flow and\/or symptoms, with regular medical review, supported by a written asthma management plan has been found to improve health outcomes. <br\/><br\/>Up-to-date information is available for patients and their families and carers.  There are easily accessible patient asthma education supports which have been implemented in conjunction with the NCPA's key stakeholder, the Asthma Society of Ireland (ASI), to assist guided self-management for this chronic condition.  These are available on both the HSE and ASI websites ( <i><\/i>and ).<br\/><br\/>A self-learning asthma E-Learning 6 modular theoretical programme based on the national asthma evidenced based guidelines and developed by NCPA in conjunction with ASI is freely available on and <i><\/i>for any health care professional who wishes to update their knowledge.  This will enable health care professionals to underpin their skill sets with theory.  There is also a similar programme available for GPs on the ICGP website.<br\/><br\/>In addition, a practical workshop is also being delivered for staff in primary and secondary care by Respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialists.  This education programme will continue throughout 2014-2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2289,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[33159\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence regarding an association (details supplied) in County Wicklow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2290,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Transport Provision","counter":2291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2292,"qnumday":822,"qnumall":"[33163\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700078#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options available to a parent of a sick child (details supplied) in County Mayo who needs financial assistance to bring the sick child to hospital in view of Health Service Executive patient transport policy which will not assist; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p><p>  The Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations 2013 provides for a &euro;100 charge for out-patient services provided at an emergency department, an accident and emergency department, a casualty department, a minor injury unit, an urgent care centre, a local injury unit or any other facility providing similar services, subject to certain exemptions.  In addition, under the Health Services (Out-Patient) Regulations 1993, the HSE may levy a charge on private patients for the use of an MRI machine in a public hospital.<\/p><p>  Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations 1987 (as amended) public in-patients in public hospitals are liable to a &euro;75 per day charge subject to a maximum of &euro;750 in any 12 consecutive months, subject to certain exemptions.  Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day.  The charge levied depends on whether accommodation is provided in a single or multiple occupancy room and if overnight accommodation is provided.<\/p><p>  As required by the Health (Amendment) Act 1986, where a hospital is informed that the patient, their personal representative or a dependent is pursuing a Road Traffic Accident (RTA) claim, billing data is generated on the local billing system.  Invoices can be raised for an RTA related in-patient or out-patient charge depending on the services provided at the hospital. <\/p><p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support to those in need of long-term residential care. Participants contribute towards the cost of their care in accordance with their means. Participants contribute up to 80% of relevant income and up to 7.5% per annum of the value of relevant assets.  This applies to a principal private residence for three years only.<\/p><p>  Under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011, charges apply for in-patient services other than for acute hospital care and for long-term residential care services supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal). Under these Regulations, the HSE and agencies providing services on its behalf, must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive inpatient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period.  Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility.   The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where inpatient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where inpatient care is provided in other settings.  The charging legislation provides that the HSE may reduce or waive charges where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to individual financial circumstances (including whether there are dependants).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":2444,"qnumday":875,"qnumall":"[33319\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will approve an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2445,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The remit spans the whole of Government. It is a pillar of Government policy that people with disabilities should be empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The National Disability Strategy is driven by this basic, but fundamentally important, objective. It is Government's goal to develop the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy. That Implementation Plan was published in July 2013 and is the first such implementation plan to be put in place since the National Disability Strategy itself was launched in 2004. The Plan was prepared by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I established in 2011. I continue to chair the Group to oversee the implementation of the Strategy. The Implementation Group brings together representatives of the relevant Government Departments and representative organisations, including the Disability Federation of Ireland, and also a number of people with disabilities. Significant discussion was undertaken between disability stakeholders and Government Departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. The Plan sets out the practical measures across all Government Departments that will be taken to advance the Strategy and ensure that available resources are used to best effect. Progress on the Plan is kept under review by the Implementation Group and thematic meetings, at which all relevant bodies are present to ensure cross-sectoral input and review, are convened. Two such thematic meetings were held in 2013 and focused on the themes of Housing and Irish Sign Language. <\/p><p>  The vision for the Health Service Executive's Disability Services Programme is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports  and services to enhance their quality of life. The Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2014 and the recently published 2014 Operational Plan for the Social Care Division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014 which it has assured me will give effect to this vision in 2014. The HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to provide specified levels of services. 2014 will also see an additional investment of &euro;14m to address deficits in disability services, a reform programme to transform services to a community based model of person centred supports, a focus on the implementation of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for residential services for people with a disability. These developments and reform proposals will be carried out in an environment of effective communications and engagement with all those involved in services, including people with a disability and the Disability Federation of Ireland , through the HSE's National Consultative Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2473,"qnumday":886,"qnumall":"[33361\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a case in which the Health Service Executive made commitments to a person (details supplied) in County Clare to provide a new wheelchair by April 2014 and that as of 24 July 2014, this person has still not received their wheelchair; when this person might expect to receive the wheelchair; his views on whether this delay has been acceptable; and the action he will take to do to rectify this situation","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2474,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2475,"content":"<p>Question No. 887 answered with Question No. 785.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2476,"content":"<p>Question No. 888 answered with Question No. 786.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2477,"content":"<p>Question No. 889 answered with Question No. 800.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2479,"qnumday":890,"qnumall":"[33373\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700080#WRFFF03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children in Cork City and County who are awaiting an appointment with the community ophthalmic physician having been referred by the school health services; the number waiting more than six months; more than 12 months; more than 18 months; more than 24 months for such an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2480,"content":"<p>Community Optometric Services are provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE).

As the arrangements for patients being discharged from acute hospitals are service matters, I have also asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700081#WRGG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Expenditure","counter":2536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700081#WRGG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2537,"qnumday":911,"qnumall":"[33454\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700081#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that there are no cuts to home help services given the severe difficulties this will cause service users and their families; that steps will be taken to ensure sufficient levels of home help are made available to support carers including the provision for more flexibility for weekend and night cover; and that the number of home help packages are sustained in an equitable divide countrywide.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.

","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2589,"content":"<p>HIV is a in Ireland since September 2011 and is transmitted through contact with the blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk of a person infected with HIV.  The most common way to get HIV is by having unprotected sex with a person who has HIV.  Unprotected sex means not using a condom.  Another common way to get HIV is by sharing drug injection equipment (such as needles and syringes) with a person infected with HIV.<br\/><br\/>Currently there is no vaccine or cure for HIV.  However over the last 15 years, a number of drugs have been developed which fight HIV infection.  A very effective treatment regimen, namely highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), is widely used in the treatment of HIV and AIDS.  The term HAART is used to describe a combination of three or more anti-HIV drugs.  This treatment suppresses the HIV virus and can reverse the damage to the immune system for some time, prolonging the lives of those infected.  The virus is continually changing, sometimes becoming resistant to current drugs, so HAART may not be a long-term solution and is not a cure.  <br\/><br\/>Truvada was licensed in 2005 by the European Commission.  In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the combination drug emtricitabine-tenofovir (Truvada) to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in those who are at high risk in combination with other preventative measures such as condom use and clean needles.  Truvada may also be used as a treatment of HIV in combination with other medications.  <br\/><br\/>The aims of the new National Sexual Health Strategy are to improve sexual health and wellbeing and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes for everyone in Ireland and across the life course, by ensuring access to high quality sexual health information, education and services.  This represents the first time that a nationally coordinated approach has been developed to address sexual health and wellbeing.  The leadership, governance and coordination required to deliver the overarching goals for the sexual health strategy will be in line with both Future Health and Healthy Ireland and through their emerging structures and mechanisms for implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":2590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2591,"qnumday":928,"qnumall":"[33527\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the availability of defibrillators; and to increase the level of training in how to operate them.

The vast majority of these patients require clinical treatment that is both hospital and community based as indicated by the HSE-ICGP Weight Management Treatment Algorithm, the clinical care pathway used by healthcare professionals. <\/p><p>  My predecessor, Minister Reilly established the Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO) comprising representatives from relevant Government Departments, the HSE, the Food Safety Authority, members of Academia, service professionals and safefood to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of overweight and obesity in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Progress has also been made on the Healthy Eating Guidelines, Calories on Menus initiative and the Report on Recommendations to reduce consumption of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Health is also developing a new obesity policy this year which will have a significant impact on the obesity agenda, provide a framework for action based on a number of informants and help lead inter-sectoral work in addressing overweight and obesity in Ireland. <\/p><p>   In relation to the particular query in relation to waiting lists for bariatric surgery raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme Coverage","counter":2636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2637,"qnumday":945,"qnumall":"[33635\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700082#WRHH03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be a review of the decision not to make the drug Fampyra, which is used in the treatment of patients with Multiple Sclerosis, available under the Health Service Executive drug payments scheme; and if his Department is reviewing the operation of current drug treatments available to MS patients.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br\/><br\/>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.

Gross  income, in respect of the over 70's medical card scheme refers to total basic income prior to any or all deductions being made. The system of assessment for those 70 years of age and over is based on significantly higher gross income limits of &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014, as set out in  legislation, compared to the standard net income thresholds of &euro;184 for a single person or &euro;266.50 for a couple. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.<br\/><br\/>If a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card under the over 70's assessment, by virtue of their gross income being over the income limits, the person may apply for a medical card under the standard means test, where they face particularly high expenses and which allows for medical, nursing and other relevant expenses to be taken into account.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70's gross income limits.  <br\/><br\/>Under the standard means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent\/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs while in the main, persons in the over 70's age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Persons aged 70 or over, who have lost eligibility for a medical card due to the 2014 budgetary change will continue to have access to free GP services. In addition, as you will be aware, the Government committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service for the entire population and the aim is to have the over 70's phase implemented this year or early next year. Furthermore, any person over 70 that does not qualify for a medical card is able to use the DPS (Drugs Payment Scheme) which caps spending on prescription drugs.<br\/><br\/>The HSE local health offices can offer assistance to those completing their Medical Card\/GP Visit Card application form or seek clarification on any aspect regarding the process of assessing eligibility for a Medical Card\/GP Visit Card.

At that time some 300 children per annum were attending the hospital for rheumatology services.  In 2012 a second consultant paediatrician with a special interest in rheumatology was funded by the HSE to support the growing demand for this service and an additional Clinical Nurse Specialist post and additional physiotherapy provision were put in place by the hospital to enhance the service.  Temple Street Children's University Hospital works with Crumlin and each hospital supports the other with regards to rheumatology services across the two sites.<\/p><p>  Demand for this service has grown since its establishment in Crumlin Hospital with over 1,100 children seen at outpatient clinics at the end of 2013.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health that there are over 700 children attending Crumlin who require ongoing treatment and follow up, many of whom require day case admission for drug therapy.  There were 800 day case attendances in 2013.  As children reach the age of 16 years of age they are transitioned to adult services, which allow younger children to attend the service.  Paediatric Consultants with a special interest in a subspecialty are required to support the general paediatric workload in the hospital.  In October of this year, the hospital put in place a full time general paediatrician and a half time general paediatrician and other supports which will enable the paediatric consultants with a special interest in rheumatology to concentrate on their subspecialty which the hospital anticipates will increase capacity to deal with the waiting lists.<\/p><p>  The HSE has advised the Department that the Hospital is currently in the process of developing a business case to identify the further resources required to deal with the increase in demand.

Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.

In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.<br\/><br\/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned.<br\/><br\/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":2794,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2795,"qnumday":1004,"qnumall":"[33886\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a statement of pension benefit or preserved pension entitlements in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway will be provided by the Health Service Executive; and if this statement will cover all periods of employment with the HSE and former health boards.","asker":"1185","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2796,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2797,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK04150"},{"type":"question","counter":2798,"qnumday":1005,"qnumall":"[33895\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700084#WRKK04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in determination of an application for medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2799,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The corresponding figure for 2011 is 32.4% and 31.3% for 2012.  It should be noted however, that this data is based on the discharge code of patients who had a diagnosis of sepsis and who were admitted to any type of intensive care environment ( including ICU, High Dependency Unit (HDU) ,Coronary Care Unit (CCU) etc) at some point during their hospitalisation.  It is not possible to conclude that these patients were admitted to ICU as a result of sepsis, or that sepsis was the cause of death.<br\/><br\/>From January 2015 Ireland will adopt the Eight Edition of the ICD (International Classification of Disease)-10-AM classification which includes a revised Australian coding standard ACS 0110 for sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock.  This is a new coding system being introduced internationally in relation to sepsis and Ireland will, for the first time, be able to systematically track its rates of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. <br\/><br\/>The Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) Report into the care and treatment provided of Ms Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital, Galway recommended that the HSE should develop a national clinical guideline on the management of sepsis and ensure that all hospitals put in place arrangements for formal staff training on the recognition and management of sepsis and on the clinically deteriorating patients including pregnant women in line with the guideline.<br\/><br\/>The report also recommended that the Department of Health should immediately review the current arrangements in place to ensure the national Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) is adequately resourced to support the national endorsement of key national guidelines.<br\/><br\/>Following on from the HIQA report, Minister Reilly requested  four national clinical guidelines to be commissioned and quality assured through the NCEC as a matter of urgency for the Irish health system.  These guidelines are a National Maternity Early Warning System Guideline, a National Paediatric Early Warning System Guideline, a National Sepsis Management Guideline and a National Clinical Handover Guideline.  These guidelines will not only detail best practice but also to make recommendations for staff education and training.  This is in order to provide for assurance of the competence of our doctors, nurses and midwives for these critical life-saving clinical issues.  The guidelines will provide recommendations for national  key performance indicators. <br\/><br\/>The NCEC has made significant progress to date on this project and all above guidelines are at an advanced stage of development:<blockquote>- National Clinical Guideline - Recognition and Management of Sepsis in Ireland, provides guidance on the recognition and management of sepsis in Ireland.  This encompasses adaption of the surviving sepsis campaign for the Irish setting.<br \/><br \/>- National Clinical Guideline - Irish Maternity Early Warning System-provides consideration for maternal sepsis. <br \/><br \/>-  National Clinical Guideline - Handover Maternity Services - provides guidance for systematic handover processes.<br \/><br \/>- National Clinical Guideline - Paediatric Early Warning System - provides guidance for recognition of the deteriorating paediatric patient.  <\/blockquote>In addition, The National Clinical Guideline No.1 National Early Warning Score was updated in August,2014 by the NCEC to include a sepsis screening pathway.  The national Patient Observation Chart has been updated in line with the above.  And finally, a  National Clinical Lead (Sepsis Workstream) has been appointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":2864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2865,"qnumday":1027,"qnumall":"[33975\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding over 70's medical card income limits in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2866,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over ended on 31 December 2008.  Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. <br\/><br\/>The gross income limit for an over 70's medical card was set at in law at &euro;500 per week for a single person and at &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014. The Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and <font color=\"#212100\">that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household<\/font>. This is recognised, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. In that context, the over 70's income limit for a single person was reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple under this Budget change. There are no proposals to change this assessment process. <br\/><br\/>Persons aged 70 or over, who have lost their eligibility for a medical card due to the 2014 budgetary change will continue to have access to free GP services. In addition, as you will be aware, the Government committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service for the entire population and the aim is to have the over 70's phase implemented this year or early next year. Furthermore, any person over 70 that does not qualify for a medical card is able to use the DPS (Drugs Payment Scheme) which caps spending on prescription drugs. <br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the standard means test, where they face particularly high expenses.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70's gross income thresholds.  <br\/><br\/>Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2868,"qnumday":1028,"qnumall":"[33977\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the procedure to be followed to secure potential funding in order to assist full time residential placement in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2869,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Qualifications","counter":2870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2871,"qnumday":1029,"qnumall":"[33984\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700085#WRLL03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a qualification for chiropodists obtained in Britain from the National Health Service is recognised here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2872,"content":"<p>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the recognition of non-Irish qualifications under Directive 2005\/36\/EC.<\/p><p>  Directive 2005\/36\/EC applies to EEA nationals with EEA qualifications who wish to practise a regulated profession in an EEA State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications, on either a self-employed or employed basis.

The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and requested that it take into consideration the recently published report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.

Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and just over 51 hours at the end of 2013.  Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October 2013 resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieve EWTD compliance, with an immediate focus on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours.  Data for June 2014 shows 93% compliance with this target, and 99.5% compliance in relation to elimination of working weeks in excess of 68 hours.  <b><\/b><br\/><br\/>NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance.  Achievement of full compliance will also require reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups. <br\/><br\/>In the July 2014 NCHD rotation there have been additional posts created to achieve EWTD compliance.  These are incorporated into the overall recruitment process. Given the additional numbers in the system, the net effect is that with the July 2014 intake there are more NCHDs currently employed than for the same time period in 2013.  The ongoing issue for hospital services remains the preference for NCHDs to take positions in major teaching sites in greater urban areas.  Where posts are vacant and suitable candidates cannot be sourced, locums are retained or alternative arrangements are made to ensure the continued delivery of the service.  However, the intention is to move to a position where reliance on agency to fill posts is minimised and permanent staff are appointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Reform","counter":3005,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07150"},{"type":"question","counter":3006,"qnumday":1077,"qnumall":"[34275\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to the proposed project 86156-3402 in the provision of a patient level costing system, if he will provide a breakdown of the costings involved in the pilot project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":3007,"qnumday":1078,"qnumall":"[34276\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to the proposed project 86156-3402 in the provision of a patient level costing system, if he will detail all the parties\/users who will have access to this shared information; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":3008,"qnumday":1079,"qnumall":"[34277\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to the proposed project 86156-3402 in the provision of a patient level costing system, the way this scheme will be funded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3009,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1077 to 1079, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  A Patient Level Costing (PLC) system is being introduced in the context of the implementation of a new funding system for public hospital care called Money Follows the Patient (MFTP).  Phase 1 of MFTP commenced in January 2014 and full implementation will take a number of years.  MFTP involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken.  As such, hospitals will be funded based on the quantity of the services they deliver to patients.  They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of delivering quality care.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered through the use of fixed budgets for MFTP activity. The MFTP approach is initially being applied to inpatient and day-case activity in public hospitals.  However, it is intended that the payment system will extend over time to cover other hospital activity and community care.<\/p><p>  An effective PLC system is essential for the proper operation of the MFTP process.  It will enable hospitals to understand their costs and, therefore, to operate effectively in the MFTP funding environment.  Although a pilot PLC project has been underway since 2010, the PLC function must now be embedded across all hospitals.  This will require investment in skills and also in PLC IT systems and feeder IT systems to improve cost collection.  The data provided by the PLC pilot is being used in conjunction with the current speciality costing methodology to set prices for services and this will continue when rolled out to more hospitals.  <\/p><p>The HSE published an Invitation to Tender for a PLC System, to include knowledge transfer, in July of this year with a closing date of 26 August.  The tenders are currently being evaluated and this process is expected to be completed by October.  Assuming a successful outcome, it is intended to establish a contract for the provision of the solution the fourth quarter of this year.<\/p><p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly in relation to the additional detailed information requested by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07450","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":3010,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07475"},{"type":"question","counter":3011,"qnumday":1080,"qnumall":"[34296\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to build the new Central Mental Hospital on the grounds of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin; the reason a decision was made to close some existing facilities at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital and to relocate the Central Mental Hospital to the site; and if he will provide a timeline of when it is expected that the new CMH will be completed.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3012,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":3014,"qnumday":1081,"qnumall":"[34297\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of psychiatric residents of St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; the number of persons receiving psychiatric day services at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital in those years; the current status of psychiatric services at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital; and if he will provide a breakdown of where residents were transferred to upon the phased closure of some units at St. Ita's Hospital.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3015,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":3016,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07850"},{"type":"question","counter":3017,"qnumday":1082,"qnumall":"[34298\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM07900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of residents of St. Jospeh&rsquo;s Intellectual Disability Unit, located on the grounds of St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin, in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; and the number of people who received day services at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Intellectual Disability Unit in those years","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3018,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM08000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Data","counter":3019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM08050"},{"type":"question","counter":3020,"qnumday":1083,"qnumall":"[34341\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700086#WRMM08100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if every hospital here complies with every aspect of the European working time directive; if he will provide the information in tabular form and on a hospital basis; and for the hospitals that do not comply in full, when those hospitals expect to be in a position to comply.

It is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies in conjunction with the Community and Voluntary sectors and I intend that this approach will continue.<\/p><p>  The overall objective of the Strategy is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.   Periodic reviews of progress across the pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which I chair and these are posted on my Department's website. <\/p><p>  The link between social disadvantage and problem drug use, in particular heroin use, is acknowledged in the National Drugs Strategy.  However,  the Strategy also recognises that problem drug use by an individual, or a group of people, is rarely caused by a single factor.  Instead, the interplay between multiple conditions and factors that put an individual at risk of using or developing problems with drugs influences the experience or outcome. These complex or interlinked factors will vary between communities and individuals.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the nature and scale of the drug problem has changed, due to the increasing geographic dispersal of problem drug use,  the wider prevalence of polydrug use and the emergence of new psychoactive substances.   The response of the HSE has involved the re-orientation of its addiction services towards polydrug issues, using a 4-tiered model approach as a national framework through which to deliver services.     Solid progress is being made with a reduction in waiting times for access to services particularly outside the Dublin area, increased availability of  places in rehabilitation programmes as well as the continued expansion of the pharmacy needle exchange programme.  This work is being complemented by greater focus on integrated care plans for individuals backed up by more co-ordinated inter-agency working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":3081,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":3082,"qnumday":1104,"qnumall":"[34587\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite additional home help hours in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3083,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO02100"},{"type":"question","counter":3085,"qnumday":1105,"qnumall":"[34589\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review a medical card application in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3086,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.<\/p><p>  In general terms, the HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  However, there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  At a national level, a dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  The issue of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is being looked by this sub-group. <\/p><p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy  in respect of the individual case that he has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO05700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Relations","counter":3121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO05800"},{"type":"question","counter":3122,"qnumday":1118,"qnumall":"[34700\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700088#WROO05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the efforts to address the issue of sleepover duty which extends the working hours for some staff members in health care facilities beyond the statutory 48 hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3123,"content":"<p>This issue was considered at a Labour Court hearing on Thursday, 11th September, 2014.

This event gave a significant boost to tourism and provided a unique opportunity to showcase Ireland and encourage trade, investment and closer business collaboration between Ireland and Florida and Pennsylvania and, in turn, support jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p><p>  The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  The procedure for dealing with all requests of this nature is that the Embassy of the country in question submits a request for permission to my Department.<\/p><p>  As part of the decision-making process the Department circulates these requests to relevant government Departments and agencies; input received is reflected in the responses issued by my Department.  In this case, the US Embassy submitted a diplomatic note to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade seeking approval for the two aircraft to enter Irish airspace in the context of the Croke Park Classic opening ceremonies.  The request was processed in accordance with these established procedures.  In addition, my Department also consulted with the Gaelic Athletic Association.<\/p><p>  The request was approved subject to a number of conditions which were outlined in the reply that issued to the Embassy.

As a result, President Obama and his Administration have been looking at the scope for action on immigration via executive authority.

In those contacts, I have asked that the charges against this individual be reviewed, and that he be released and permitted to return home to Ireland.

While Ireland cannot interfere with the judicial process in Egypt, our concern at the continued and lengthy period of detention has been raised with the Egyptian authorities in a clear and sustained manner, as has the critical importance of due process in this case. I have also emphasised that this individual was only seventeen when the alleged offences took place.

The EU encouraged the Myanmar\/Burma government to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence, including the status and welfare of the Rohingya and expressed regret that Rohingya could not self identify during the recent census. The EU also expressed readiness to cooperate with Myanmar\/Burma on initiatives which promote inter-communal understanding.<\/p><p>  In March 2014, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar\/Burma, and urged the Government of Myanmar\/Burma to step up its efforts to put an end to such remaining human rights violations and abuses.

Some other religious minorities face similar persecution.  It should be acknowledged however that a number of minority religious groups, including some Christian denominations, are specifically tolerated and protected under the Iranian Constitution.<\/p><p>The UN Secretary General&rsquo;s report to the UN Human Rights Council in March of this year on the subject of human rights in Iran noted there had been no improvements in the situation of religious minorities,   who continue to face violations of their rights which are entrenched in law and in practice.  The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran estimates, in his most recent report, that there were, as of January of this year, 307 members of religious minorities in detention in Iran, of whom 50 were Christians. He details a worrying pattern of persecution faced by Christians and other religious minorities and suggests that converts from Muslim backgrounds are most commonly prosecuted. <\/p><p>  Ireland has repeatedly addressed the human rights situation in its bilateral contacts with Iran and in the relevant international fora.  Just yesterday, at the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland expressed concerns about the persecution of some Christian and other religious minorities and our hope that the stated intention of Iran to improve human rights protection, an intention which we welcomed, will include these minority groups. Our concerns are also relayed directly to the Iranian Ambassador and Embassy on all appropriate occasions, including most recently at senior official level earlier this week.<\/p><p>  Similar concerns regarding the plight of religious minorities were also expressed in two separate statements at the March 2014 session of the Human Rights Council. In addition, my Department is preparing to participate in the upcoming Universal Periodic Review of Iran which will take place at the UN Human Rights Council later this year. <\/p><p>  More broadly, recent months have seen a serious deterioration in the situation faced by minorities across the wider Middle East region which is cause for great concern. This is most obviously evident in the extreme brutality and lawlessness demonstrated by ISIS in neighbouring Iraq and in Syria which is utterly abhorrent and unacceptable.

More than 190,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 10.8 million people within the country who are in need of immediate life-saving support, 4.7 million of them in areas that are very difficult to access. There are a further 3 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries. <\/p><p>  The operating environment for the provision of humanitarian assistance is volatile and insecure. As the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, questions persist as to how civilians in urgent need can be reached. Despite the immense constraints, Ireland has been working through a variety of channels, including our established UN partners, NGO partners and the Red Cross\/Red Crescent in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan to ensure that Irish aid is delivered across borders and conflict lines to those in acute need.<\/p><p>  The scale and severity of the crisis requires a sustained response from the international community. Ireland welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2165 on 14 July 2014, which authorised the delivery of humanitarian aid by the UN and its partners across the border into Syria without the consent of the Assad regime. On 28 August, the UN reported that for the first time in six months there had been some improvement on humanitarian access to Syria as a result of the adoption of this resolution. Monitoring mechanisms are now operational at three border crossings in Turkey and Jordan. <\/p><p>  As of 28 August, the UN had sent nine shipments to Syria from neighbouring countries pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2165. This included seven shipments from Turkey and two from Jordan. More shipments are planned this month in close coordination with the UN humanitarian team in Damascus. This is in line with the UN&rsquo;s &lsquo;whole-of-Syria&rsquo; approach, to ensure that assistance across conflict lines and national borders reaches those most in need. Nonetheless, 241,000 people still remain under siege in a number of areas, and much more needs to be done by the parties to ensure that humanitarian access is rapid, regular, safe, and unhindered.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been playing its part in helping alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, and will continue to advocate internationally for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian access and Resolution 2165 on cross-border and cross-line access.  The EU is the largest donor in this prolonged crisis, and Ireland has used every opportunity available to encourage donors to honour their pledges towards the humanitarian response. EU Ministers are agreed on the need to provide such support to the people of Syria.<\/p><p>  Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. At the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and the region held in Kuwait last January, Ireland pledged to provide &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance over the course of 2014. Given the scale of the crisis, we have already exceeded this pledge by &euro;2 million. Since 2011, Ireland has provided over &euro;28 million in humanitarian support to Syria, delivered through UN partners and NGOs.  We are continuing to review developments and the need for additional assistance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ05900","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":3305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ05950"},{"type":"question","counter":3306,"qnumday":1181,"qnumall":"[33297\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions that have been taken by the Irish Government to ensure the release of the Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted from their school in Chibok, Nigeria in April 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":3307,"qnumday":1204,"qnumall":"[34135\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ06100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the schoolgirls abducted in Nigeria (details supplied) in April 2014, most of whom remain in captivity; and his plans to communicate to the relevant diplomatic authorities of Nigeria.","asker":"1065","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":3308,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1181 and 1204 together.<br\/><br\/>I was appalled by the abduction of more than 200 young girls from a school in the Nigerian town of Chibok in April.  The Government strongly condemns these and other similar abductions.  We have urged the Nigerian authorities to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to accept international assistance to locate the schoolgirls.  We fully support the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General and the EU High Representative <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy <\/font>that the abducted girls are freed and those responsible are brought to justice.  <br\/><br\/>I am also deeply concerned about the ongoing security situation in Northern Nigeria.  I welcome the continuing efforts of the EU as well as several individual EU Member States, the UN and the USA to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their capacity to provide security and combat terrorism.  The EU is currently funding the provision of technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor of Nigeria to implement and coordinate counter-terrorism legislation and crisis management structures, and to develop capacity to address the problem of increasing radicalisation and recruitment. <br\/><br\/>The UN Security Council has also underlined the continuing international concern.  On 22 May its Al Qaida Sanctions Committee added Boko Haram to the list of individuals and entities subjected to targeted financial sanctions and an arms embargo.  Boko Haram was also added by the EU to its list of people and groups covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources with effect from 29 May. <br\/><br\/>Ireland supports the decisions reached at the Summit on Security in Nigeria held in Paris on 17 May, at which Nigeria and its neighbours committed to intensifying regional and international cooperation to combat Boko Haram terrorism.  A follow-up conference was held in Abuja on 3 September.  This process brought together Nigeria, its neighbours, the EU and other international partners to discuss regional security cooperation in the fight against Boko Haram.  The conference also underlined the importance of creating a secure environment in which the human rights of civilians in affected areas would be promoted and protected. <br\/><br\/>Our Embassy in Abuja, working locally in cooperation with EU and other key partners, remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities, which have primary responsibility for securing the safe release of the missing schoolgirls and addressing the broader security situation.  <br\/><br\/>Acts of violence of this nature against schoolchildren are completely unacceptable.  Ireland is a strong supporter of the rights of women and girls, and in particular the right of girls to education.  We will continue to encourage and support the Nigerian Government in their efforts to locate and free the abducted schoolgirls, to counter radicalisation and terrorism within its borders and to promote full respect for human rights. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3309,"content":"<p>Question No. 1182 answered with Question No. 1166.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diaspora Issues","counter":3310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ06350"},{"type":"question","counter":3311,"qnumday":1183,"qnumall":"[33382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700090#WRQQ06400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of Irish citizens that are registered in the citizens' registration system; the number in each country; and, if possible, to distinguish between those identified as being resident abroad and those on short-term trips.","asker":"954","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":3312,"content":"<p>The Citizen&rsquo;s Registration service is a voluntary service which encourages Irish citizens travelling or living overseas to register their contact details with the Department of Foreign and Trade.  This means that in the event of an unforeseen crisis such as a natural disaster or civil unrest, the Department can proactively contact the citizen, ensure they are safe, keep them informed of any evacuation plans and provide assistance where necessary. Due to Data Protection obligations, registrations received under the Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility are only valid for the duration of an individual&rsquo;s visit to a country and are not kept for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it has been given.  As such, registrations where the citizens&rsquo; date of departure from a country has passed are deleted.  Furthermore, the Citizens&rsquo; registration system was designed primarily for use in a crisis situation in a specific country or region.  Accordingly, an overall total figure for all countries is not readily available to extract from the database.As records are not retained for longer than is necessary, it is only possible to give a snapshot of the number of citizens registered on a given day.  Also, as citizens can register in advance of their actual travel abroad, the numbers registered for each country may not give an accurate reflection of the number of Irish citizens currently in that country.  Furthermore, each citizen can also register up to ten additional adults and ten additional minors who may be travelling with them, the detail of which cannot be readily extracted for these statistical purposes.<br\/><br\/>As registration is voluntary, the figures provided below relate only to those people who have chosen to register and there may well be people either visiting or resident in any of these countries, who have chosen not to register.  On 09 September 2014, the following are the number of individual registrations of Irish citizens who are currently in, or travelling at a specified date in the future,

Ireland, together with our EU partners, abstained on the resolution. <br\/><br\/>There has been much misinterpretation of this vote, and I have previously explained the context in a debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 31 July. I am glad now of the opportunity to clarify the matter also on the record of the D&aacute;il. <br\/><br\/>It is important to stress two points. Firstly, all Irish diplomats, whether posted at the UN or elsewhere, act in accordance with instructions from the Minister or the Department, and it is invidious to attempt to personalise their actions. Secondly, Ireland did not oppose the resolution at the HRC, or the establishment of an investigation into breaches of international law in the recent conflict in and around Gaza. <br\/><br\/>On the day before the HRC vote, EU Foreign Ministers had met in Brussels and, following a lengthy discussion on Gaza, had agreed a set of Conclusions with regard to Gaza and the wider Middle East Peace Process which took substantial account of my own intervention in the debate.  <br\/><br\/>At the Human Rights Council, Ireland made a very clear statement in the debate on the resolution, including the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;  <i>Irish people have been appalled by the upsurge of violence in Gaza, and especially the very high and unacceptable level of civilian casualties. Ireland condemns both the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel by Hamas and other militant groups, and the killing of <\/i><br \/><br \/><i>hundreds of civilians in military attacks by Israel on targets in Gaza which fail to respect the requirement under international law for any military action to be proportionate and <\/i><br \/><br \/><i>discriminate.  It is clear to us that neither side is paying adequate regard to the cost of their actions on innocent civilians.&rdquo; <\/i><\/blockquote>Ireland further stated that it agreed that any breaches of international law should be investigated.<br\/><br\/>The EU group at the HRC, including Ireland, had however signalled a number of problems with the resolution, and had negotiated with the Palestinian delegation to try and resolve these. These reservations were not about the general thrust of the text, but about the precise terms of the resolution we were being asked to agree with &ndash; which is something we must always take into account.<br\/><br\/>The specific issues included: that the resolution should clearly condemn all relevant actions, including firing of rockets at Israeli civilian targets; that any investigation should cover all alleged breaches of international law, by either side; and that the existing UN mechanisms should be used to carry out the investigation, rather than setting up a new mechanism. <br\/><br\/>The last point related both to our desire to see a speedy and effective investigation &ndash; the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was already established on the ground in the West Bank, ready to go &ndash; and to a long standing concern which has arisen a number of times at the HRC of establishing new bodies to investigate specific issues rather than using the mechanisms which are already established for the purpose. We had expressed these concerns before, and the sponsors of the resolution were fully aware of them when they drafted their text.<br\/><br\/>Ireland and the EU group worked hard in negotiations to try and improve the resolution on these points. We hoped until a late point that these negotiations would result in a text that we could vote in favour of. Unfortunately this didn&rsquo;t happen &ndash; at a very late stage the Palestinian delegation received new instructions which terminated the ongoing negotiations, and possible compromise solutions which had been discussed were taken off the table. This left us with little choice. The problems with the text were not resolved, and so the EU group took a common decision to abstain.<br\/><br\/>It is important to be aware that abstention on a resolution in an international forum is not the same as a &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote, and nor is it simply &lsquo;sitting on the fence&rsquo;. Countries who abstain are, in most cases, signalling that they are not trying to block the resolution, but they have specific difficulties with its terms which prevents them supporting it. This was stated directly by the EU at the session, and was fully understood by other countries present. It was also always clear to us that the resolution was going to pass &ndash; it did not depend on Ireland&rsquo;s vote.<br\/><br\/>EU members at the HRC try to vote together where possible, to maximise our influence there. In this case, had the EU not decided on a common abstention, the indications were that no other EU partner was considering a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; vote, while perhaps four of the nine EU members might have voted &lsquo;No&rsquo; instead. This would have resulted in a worse voting outcome for the resolution and in the longer term would have weakened the influence of the EU, which Ireland seeks to leverage, at the HRC. <br\/><br\/>It is also clear that, having negotiated at great length to try and achieve certain improvements, only to have the other side terminate negotiations, if we had then nonetheless proceeded to vote in favour of the unchanged text notwithstanding the unresolved problems, our own credibility in all future negotiations would have been seriously damaged.<br\/><br\/>Once the resolution was passed, as we knew it would be, Ireland made clear that we will fully support the Commission of Inquiry in fulfilling its mandate. This remains the case and I look forward to receiving and considering the report of the Commission in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Provision","counter":3324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":3325,"qnumday":1187,"qnumall":"[33464\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to open an embassy or mission in Algeria, North Africa in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":3326,"content":"<p>Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation is made by the Government based on national priorities, including our political, economic and trade priorities and the needs of Irish communities abroad.

Recent events have demonstrated the acute risks faced by religious minorities from terrorist groups such as ISIS and others. <\/p><p>  The extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council on 15 August 2014 which I attended adopted conclusions which condemned all violence against minorities in Iraq and called for the urgent formation of a unity Government which would address the needs and legitimate aspirations of all Iraqi citizens. I welcome the fact that such a unity government has now been agreed in Iraq, led by Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi. The Council at its 15 August meeting also undertook to cooperate with the Iraqi and Kurdish regional authorities in combatting terrorism. The EU is the leading provider of humanitarian and development assistance to the countries affected by the Syrian and Iraqi crises.<\/p><p>  Ireland co-sponsored the request for the recent special session of the UN Human Rights Council on Iraq, which condemned the widespread violation of human rights, including murder, abduction, displacement, torture and sexual violence against religious minorities by ISIS, and called on the Iraqi authorities to promote and uphold human rights laws and international humanitarian law and to promote religious freedom and pluralism and to protect Iraqis from sectarian violence. <\/p><p>  Ireland as a current UN HRC member has also fully supported UN efforts, and in particular the work of the HRC Commission of Inquiry, to investigate the very many human rights violations and atrocities which have been perpetrated throughout the last three-and-a-half years of conflict in Syria. Ireland has also repeatedly supported all calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the ICC.<\/p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  This is a priority for Ireland as a current member of the UN Human Rights Council and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year. <\/p><p>  I have raised the possibility of providing protection for some refugees from the recent violence in northern Iraq with Minister Frances Fitzgerald, and this is being advanced by officials in my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality. Ireland is already accepting 90 Syrian refugees in 2014 under its refugee resettlement programme with the UN High Commission for Refugees. Ultimately, asylum in Ireland or in Europe cannot provide the solution to this problem, because the numbers are too great and because this would in practice spell the end for many religious communities who have survived in the region for centuries. <\/p><p>  Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, Ireland has provided over &euro;28 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the Syrian refugee population in neighbouring countries. Ireland has provided a further &euro;1.155 million in assistance to Iraq this year, most of which has been provided for humanitarian relief in Northern Iraq to assist the population displaced by ISIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":3336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR01750"},{"type":"question","counter":3337,"qnumday":1191,"qnumall":"[33571\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the Ombudsman's investigative report on passports for Irish-born children of non-EEA-EU-Swiss citizen; and the steps his Department have taken and will take following its publication. ","asker":"1195","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":3338,"content":"<p>In July 2014 the Ombudsman published a report &lsquo;Passports for Irish-born children of non&ndash;EEA parents&rsquo; following his investigation into complaints that some non-EEA workers had faced difficulties in obtaining passports for their children born in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In the cases under investigation, the children were all born in Ireland after 1 January, 2005 to parents who were non-EU\/EEA\/Swiss nationals.  This meant that their entitlement to Irish citizenship was subject to the 2004 amendment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 (the Act).  The Act provides that at least one parent must be lawfully resident in the State for 3 of the 4 years preceding to and including the child&rsquo;s date birth.  In these cases, the evidence of the parents&rsquo; lawful residence in the State, which was submitted with the children&rsquo;s passport applications, did not meet the statutory requirement as determined by the Department of Justice and Equality, the department with responsibility for citizenship policy.  As their entitlement to Irish citizenship had been not demonstrated at the time of submission of the passport applications, the passports could not be issued to them in accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008.  <\/p><p>  In his report, the Ombudsman stated that while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had been correctly applying the law in relation to the processing of this category of passport application, the administrative processes of the agencies involved in this policy area were likely to cause difficulties for members of the public that could amount to unfairness and unnecessary delay in individual cases.  In his report only one finding against the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was made and that was to the effect that the Department&rsquo;s contacts with the Department of Justice, whereby it seeks advice and direction are, in the absence of a protocol with agreed deadlines for responses, the cause of delays and uncertainty for passport applicants.  The lack of such a protocol was found to be contrary to fair or sound administration.<\/p><p>  Arising from this, the Ombudsman recommended in his report that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should &ndash;<\/p><p>  (i) obtain clarification on a number of outstanding issues relating to citizenship policy from the Department of Justice and Equality; and<\/p><p>  (ii) set up a consultative framework with the department of Justice and Equality that would see the appointment of liaison officers in both Departments who will be responsible for dealing with cases\/correspondence on citizenship and passport policy matters within a six week timeframe.<\/p><p>  These recommendations were accepted by the Department last June.  <\/p><p>  On foot of the investigation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has now received clarification on a number of related citizenship policy matters from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Additionally, a consultative process between the Departments with appointed liaison officers has now been established.  The first meeting of liaison officers occurred on 28 August, 2014 and a second is scheduled over the coming weeks.   It is intended to hold meetings every four to six weeks thereafter.  These are in addition to the weekly contacts that are made to follow up on any outstanding issues and\/or to discuss new issues that may require immediate attention of the Departments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Application Refusals","counter":3339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":3340,"qnumday":1192,"qnumall":"[33577\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700091#WRRR02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of passport applications for children of non-EEA\/EU\/Swiss parents rejected in the years 2007 to date in 2014 as the reckonable residency of their parents was not sufficient.","asker":"1195","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":3341,"content":"<p>The number of applications for children, born since 1 January, 2005, which were rejected and referred back to the applicant or those which were cancelled under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that they were not Irish citizens, is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Rejected back to the applicant <\/th><th>Cancelled<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>786<\/td><td>276<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>935<\/td><td>516<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>1,031<\/td><td>622<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>970<\/td><td>448<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>1,155<\/td><td>586<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>1,208<\/td><td>600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1,081<\/td><td>504<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>840<\/td><td>157<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>8,006<\/td><td>3,709<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The preceding table shows that 8,006 applications were referred back to the applicant for additional evidence of citizenship.The Department does not keep records that would break down this amount to children with non-EU\/EEA\/Swiss parents, who had not sufficient residence to meet the requirements of Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended.  <br\/><br\/>Of the total referred back to the applicants and their parents, 3,709 were eventually cancelled usually because <blockquote>(i)no reply was received;<br \/><br \/>(ii)  the application was out of date; or<blockquote><blockquote>(iii) additional information was received but was insufficient to progress the application to passport issue under the Passports Act, 2008. <\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>From the figures above, a balance of 4,297 applications remain to be finalised.

He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law.  Officials in my Department keep in regular contact with the Embassy of Pakistan on this, and a number of other issues. Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about the case of Mrs. Bibi and calls for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br\/><br\/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression plays a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the Bibi judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.In June 2014, the EU issued a Declaration on violence against women in Pakistan, expressing deep concern at the wide-spread violence perpetrated against women there. <br\/><br\/>The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014 under the Co-chairmanship of Mr Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Foreign Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr David O'Sullivan, Chief Operating Officer of the European External Action Service.

At the Council, Ministers observed a minute&rsquo;s silence in tribute to the victims.  Conclusions were adopted that called upon separatist groups to ensure full, immediate, safe and secure access to the crash site and the surrounding area.  The Conclusions further supported the establishment of a full, transparent and independent international investigation into these events.

In addition, the Council established the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform Ukraine.<\/p><p>  At the July Council, we also had an extensive exchange on the recent developments in the Middle East.  Ministers expressed their concern for the escalation of violence in Gaza and condemned the tragic loss of life on both sides.  The discussion focussed on the prospects of securing a ceasefire and the need to get the broader peace process back on track.

I joined with my colleagues in condemning in the strongest possible terms the atrocities which had taken place in recent weeks, especially, though not exclusively, against vulnerable minority populations such as Christians and the Yazidi people.

Along with a number of other EU partners I intervened to ensure that the Council Conclusions which were agreed fully reflected and respected the individual legal and political positions of Member States in responding to such requests.<\/p><p>  The situation in Gaza was also discussed. Council Conclusions expressing deep concern for the fragile situation on the ground were agreed.  Through these Conclusions we also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s full support for Egyptian efforts to broker a lasting ceasefire. In addition, I also called for a more active role on the part of the EU in working to promote the resumption of substantive peace negotiations and in supporting any comprehensive agreement that is eventually concluded.<\/p><p>  On Ukraine, Ministers expressed their concern at the worsening crisis in the Eastern part of the country, and the deteriorating humanitarian situation.

As the Deputy may be aware, enhanced sanctions were subsequently adopted and are now in force.<\/p><p>  At the August Council meeting, Ministers also had a discussion on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, adopting short Conclusions.  These Conclusions expressed, on behalf of the EU, our condolences to the African governments and people affected by the outbreak.<\/p><p>  Finally, although not a formal Council formation, I met with my EU Foreign Minister counterparts in Milan at the end of August (29-30 August) for the bi-annual informal meeting (&lsquo;Gymnich&rsquo;), hosted by the Italian Presidency.

In relation to Gaza, the Council principally emphasised, as did Ireland nationally, the urgent need to end the fighting and restore the ceasefire, so as to bring an end to the dreadful violence being suffered by the population.  However the Council also emphasised, in Conclusions on both 22 July and 15 August, that a return to the <i>status quo ante<\/i>in Gaza was unacceptable, and that there had to be a process leading to the lifting of the closure restrictions, and an improvement in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.  Ireland has long advocated at EU level for greater concerted international efforts to bring about an end to the unjust blockade of Gaza.<br\/><br\/>The Egyptian Government is seeking to further develop the understandings with both Israel and Hamas which led to the renewed ceasefire on 26 August last, with a view to beginning a process in which the closure would be substantially relaxed.  The prospects for these discussions, and the engagement of each side to find a different way forward, have yet to become clear.<br\/><br\/>The EU has also offered any help it can to bring about fundamental improvement to the current situation and conditions in Gaza, including the possible reactivation of the EU&rsquo;s border assistance mission at Rafah, and measures to assist the Palestinian Authority in re-establishing its presence as a governing authority in Gaza.  The Council will continue to consider options in this regard.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the broader peace process, Ireland has argued in recent months that following the indefinite ending of the US-facilitated direct negotiations process in April, the EU needs to begin a reflection on its overall policy in relation to seeking a two state solution to the conflict.  Notwithstanding the focus on Gaza, and indeed recognising that Gaza is an integral element of the overall problem, Ireland and other member States successfully pressed for the July Council Conclusions to include also a substantive re-iteration of the basic principles and parameters on which a comprehensive solution to the conflict must be based.

The amount due by apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology during the academic year.<br\/><br\/>  Since 2004, F&Aacute;S\/SOLAS has paid a part of the Annual Student Contribution due in respect of apprentices, with apprentices themselves paying the part of the contribution relating to examination fees. As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.<br\/><br\/>  From January 2014 up to the end of the academic year in June, apprentices paid &euro;833 (1\/3 of &euro;2,500) per typical attendance block although a small number of apprentices paid more for longer blocks. These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same as students in IoTs in terms of the annual student contribution. Apprentices had already been paying &euro;233 (28% of &euro;833) in respect of the exam fee element of the ASC.<br\/><br\/>  However, unlike full time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs. This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme. This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI.

The main findings of this report relating to the assessment of children with special needs were under consideration by my Department, Department of Health and the Health Service Executive at that time.<br\/><br\/>  As a consequence of this consideration, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) were requested to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs. The NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs on 17 May, 2013.<br\/><br\/>  This is a very significant report which is based on a review of best practice in both national and international research and follows a wide process of consultation with children with Special Educational Needs, parents, representative groups, educational partners, voluntary bodies and advocacy groups, including the National Disability Authority.<br\/><br\/>  The main recommendaitons contained in the NCSE policy advice concur with the NDA report. The NCSE report concludes that diagnosis should not be a prerequisite or determinant for the allocation of additional resources for a child or young person with special educational needs which should instead be based on the needs of the child, irrespective of category of disability. Instead, greater use should be made of school - based data and school performance in decision-making related to resource allocation.<br\/><br\/>  One of the principal recommendations of the policy advice is that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools, based on the profiled need of each school, which will ensure that a more equitable resource allocation system will be in place for students, which will be based on their educational needs as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of disability.<br\/><br\/>  The NCSE published its Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs on 18 June 2014.<br\/><br\/>  The report recommends that all children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category and a new allocation model should be developed, based on a schools educational profile, while also providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school in order to support inclusion.<br\/><br\/>  To assist with the process of considering the report recommendations, my Department has begun to gather information required to develop the proposed new model. This will review how the proposed model will impact on schools.

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.<br\/><br\/>  The NCSE have allocated over 10,900 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts in schools to support students with special needs for the 2014\/2015 school year. This is more SNA posts than have ever previously been allocated, and has increased from 10,656 posts at the end of the last school year. The exact numbers of SNAs will become clear when enrolments of students in mainstream schools are finalised later this month.<br\/><br\/>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<br\/><br\/>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time. There is always a significant churn of posts within the system.<br\/><br\/>  Details of schools and their SNA allocations, including in Co. Sligo, are available on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>  JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, operated by the Department of Social Protection provide work experience placements for interns for a six to nine month period. This scheme aims to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. Recognised schools and Education Training Boards (ETBs) may choose to participate in the scheme if they wish. My Department's circular 46\/2011 states that an internship must not cause an existing member of staff to be displaced from the school or be used to fill a current vacancy in the school.<br\/><br\/>  In addition, the Department of Social Protection have stringent monitoring in place at local level and investigate any complaint or alleged breach of the scheme. Schools and ETBs, participating in the scheme, must submit an online monthly compliance check to verify that the terms of the internship are being met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700093#WRTT09700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":3525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700093#WRTT09800"},{"type":"question","counter":3526,"qnumday":1265,"qnumall":"[33372\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700093#WRTT09900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she has had any discussions with the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding the inclusion of education in the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership; if she has concerns regarding the negative impact that inclusion of education within this sphere would have on educational institutions here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3527,"content":"<p>The negotiations with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are the most ambitious and broad based that the EU has ever undertaken. The breadth of the negotiations reflects the extensive benefits that could be won from any final agreement. However, when the EU Council agreed the negotiating directives to the Commission for these talks under last year's Irish presidency of the EU, it was unanimously agreed by all Ministers, and accepted by the Commission, that any agreement with the United States would not herald any lowering of standards that our citizens rightly value. This is an important consideration in how the EU conducts its negotiations.<br\/><br\/>  The Commission is required to frequently consult with Member States during the course of the talks. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which co-ordinates this issue from a national perspective, uses these opportunities to tell EU negotiators about what we want to achieve from the talks. In this context, that Department is co-ordinating with all Government Departments, including my Department, in the ongoing development of Ireland's trade policy position, to ensure that our best interests can be advocated to the EU Commission and included in the negotiations with the United States.<br\/><br\/>  In relation to education, there is no proposal from the EU to further open up education services in the TTIP.

Young people who attended socially mixed schools and middle-class schools were more likely than those from working class schools to go on to some form of further education and training or higher education. <br\/><br\/>The DEIS programme is my Department's main policy initiative aimed at addressing educational disadvantage.  All 849 primary and post primary schools, with a combined enrolment of over160,000 pupils, participating in DEIS receive a range of additional resources including additional staffing, funding, access to literacy and numeracy programmes and assistance with activities such as school planning.  <br\/><br\/>Ongoing evaluation of the DEIS Programme shows that these supports are achieving improved learning outcomes with continuing gains in literacy and numeracy evident in longitudinal testing as well as improved attendance rates.  Second level attainment levels are also improving in DEIS schools.  The key DEIS supports of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme, now delivered by TUSLA,promote child and family engagement with education and thereby achieve greater levels of participation and retention.  <br\/><br\/>In addition, for almost two decades, there has been a strong focus in Ireland on achieving equity of access to higher education. Initiatives include the student grant system; the Fund for Students with Disabilities; the Student Assistance Fund; and the inclusion in the HEA funding allocation model of metrics which recognise and encourage institutional performance in relation to access.  Estimated participation by target socio-economic groups has increased from 27% to 30% for those from non-manual worker backgrounds and from 33% to 36% for those from semi and unskilled worker backgrounds between 2005 and 2013.<br\/><br\/>The Report also highlights the importance of guidance provision. My Department recommends that guidance is a whole school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing a key role within the overall school team approach.

The importance of literacy skills was reinforced in the legislation establishing SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority, which included a requirement for a strategy aimed at promoting, developing and encouraging literacy and numeracy.<br\/><br\/>Strategic Goal 2 of the Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019, launched in May this year, includes the devising and implementation of a strategy for literacy and numeracy across the further education and training sector. The actions include improving the literacy and numeracy of the adult population, enhancing CPD provision for staff, embedding literacy and numeracy within further education and training provision and setting targets and objectives for literacy and numeracy programmes. SOLAS will shortly establish a Strategic Implementation Advisory Group of stakeholders to support the implementation of the FET Strategy.  <br\/><br\/>The Review of the Adult Literacy Service published last year made a number of recommendations which have been taken into account in devising the FET strategy and in revising the adult literacy operational guidelines.<br\/><br\/>The literacy levels of adults in Ireland have improved in recent years as shown in the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) report published last year.

The metrics used for this element are based on the number of students from target groups in the National Access Plan, who are enrolled in each funded institution.

My Department has already begun to progress this commitment, mindful that changes in school autonomy need to be carefully planned and supported if they are to achieve improved educational outcomes for our children. <br\/><br\/>The skills levels of school leaders and teachers are critical factors in enabling schools to benefit from both existing and any increased levels of school autonomy with regard to school governance, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. The Department has made considerable investment to build the professional competence of school leaders through its support services and through the work of the education partners including the IPPN and NAPD. Developing the leadership skills of principals and deputy principals will be an essential requirement of any plans to increase school autonomy. Equally, the strong focus in current policy development on increasing the skills levels of Irish teachers and driving the professionalism of teaching, evident in the work of the Teaching Council, is important.<br\/><br\/>We are already moving towards greater autonomy in the area of curriculum and assessment. Already, the primary school curriculum provides considerable flexibility to schools and teachers to select and prioritise different aspects of curricular content to advance the learning needs of students. The major reforms that are already being introduced at junior cycle will bring further autonomy for schools over curriculum. The Junior Cycle Student Award (JCSA) offers flexibilities and opportunities for innovation in curriculum through enabling schools to offer short courses and alternative learning experiences. It already includes formal recognition for school-based assessment outcomes. This extends considerably the scope for post-primary schools to plan and teach creatively and to implement curricula that promote innovation and independent learning.<br\/><br\/>The proposals made in the recently published NCSE discussion document regarding the creation of a single pot of SEN-related teaching posts in schools may offer further opportunities for school autonomy. These would provide schools with the greater freedom to allocate and manage staff with required flexibility which is envisaged in the Programme for Government. The recent introduction of school self-evaluation at primary and post-primary levels enables schools themselves to arrive at school-specific information on how well they are doing, which they are expected to use in their planning for improvement. This encourages schools to use their autonomy to prioritise particular learning targets and to make the necessary pedagogical changes to achieve those targets within a broad curriculum and pedagogical framework.<br\/><br\/>We know that putting appropriate supports in place is a critical step to realising in a fresh way the curriculum, pedagogical, and assessment autonomy that schools currently have and may be given in the future and that is why this work is already underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700095#WRVV02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Evaluations","counter":3637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700095#WRVV02650"},{"type":"question","counter":3638,"qnumday":1310,"qnumall":"[33639\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700095#WRVV02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to require schools to draw five year development plans for their schools and individual teachers.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3639,"content":"<p>Since November 2012 when the school self-evaluation circulars and Guidelines were launched, schools have been required to engage in school self-evaluation.

The Department undertook to create a culture of continuous improvement in schools by improving radically the assessment and reporting of progress at student, school and national level and by focussing school self-evaluation and inspection on literacy and numeracy. <br\/><br\/>The Strategy contained a number of school level targets, it set a target of improving the performance of primary children in the National Assessment of Mathematics and English Reading. The most recent assessment, carried out in 2009 and published in 2010 was a baseline assessment. The 2014 assessment was carried out this year and its publication in due course will indicate to what extent the ambitious targets in the Strategy have been met.<br\/><br\/>At post-primary level, there are targets in the Strategy relating to PISA: in literacy and numeracy, the target was to increase by 5 percentage points the students performing at level 4 and above and halve the percentage of students performing at or below level 1 by 2020.  2012 PISA results show that in print reading 37.4% of Irish students performed at level 4 or above (28.9% in 2009) and 9.7% of students performed at or below level 1 (17.2% in 2009). In mathematics in 2012, 31% of Irish students performed at level 4 or above (26.1% in 2009) and 16.9% of students performed at level 1 or below (20.9% in 2009). The targets at level 4 have been achieved but we cannot be complacent, if we are to achieve world class results. However, there is more work to be done for students at level 1. <br\/><br\/>There are also targets in mathematics; the target, by 2020, was to increase uptake of higher level mathematics at junior certificate to 60% and leaving certificate mathematics to 30%. In the State Examinations, uptake at higher level has again increased this year to 54% in Junior Certificate and 27% in Leaving Certificate. <br\/><br\/>In view of the encouraging figures above, it is anticipated that the targets set out in the Strategy will be met by 2020.<br\/><br\/>In addition, school self-evaluation has been rolled out to all schools as a tool for schools to review and improve their own performance.

The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students. <br\/><br\/>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.<br\/><br\/>  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils. <br\/><br\/>Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels.

The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students. The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools. <br\/><br\/>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is a service under the management of my Department which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.

The Strategy contains a number of recommendations that are intended to strengthen the voice of children and young people within the education system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700096#WRWW04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parent and Student Charter","counter":3757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700096#WRWW04950"},{"type":"question","counter":3758,"qnumday":1352,"qnumall":"[33858\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700096#WRWW05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the dates on which she will publish the Students' Charter and the Parents' Charter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":3759,"qnumday":1353,"qnumall":"[33859\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700096#WRWW05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the input that second level students have had into the development of the Students' Charter to date.

Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school \/ ETB.<br\/><br\/>  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2014\/2015 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0044\/2014 which issued on 12 May 2014 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: <br\/><br\/>  With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. <br\/><br\/>  With the exception of SNAs who have been re-employed on permanent contracts or have chosen to opt out of the panel in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 6 of the circular, all SNAs who have been made redundant since 1 May 2013 are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.<br\/><br\/>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including SNAs who were employed prior to 1 May 2013, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.<br\/><br\/>  When an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 12-18 of Circular 44\/2014.<br\/><br\/>  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.<br\/><br\/>  Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700097#WRXX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3803,"content":"<p>Question No. 1366 answered with Question No. 1363.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board","counter":3804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700097#WRXX03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3805,"qnumday":1367,"qnumall":"[33898\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700097#WRXX03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if staff salaries in Caranua are funded from the &euro;110m allocated to the body or from other Exchequer funds; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3806,"content":"<p>All expenditure incurred by the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (Caranua) in the performance of its functions, including its payroll costs, are met from the investment account operated by the National Treasury Management Agency.

My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.<\/p><p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.

School building projects which were previously initiated, but not included in the current 5-year construction programme, continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to my Department in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":4018,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":4019,"qnumday":1444,"qnumall":"[34855\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding fair funding of schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":4020,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that I have been in discussions with all the education partners, which included Pre-Budget matters.<br\/><br\/>I met with the Joint Managerial Body which represents all voluntary secondary schools, including fee charging schools.<br\/><br\/>I received their Pre-Budget 2015 submissions, which covered the matters raised by the Deputy.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage anticipate any specific decisions the Government may take in the next Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":4021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":4022,"qnumday":1445,"qnumall":"[34861\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding pupil-teacher ratio; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":4023,"content":"<p>The issue raised by the Deputy is about seeking a reduction in the pupil teacher ratio for fee-charging Protestant secondary schools.<br\/><br\/>  The Government's focus in recent years has been on operating a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.<br\/><br\/>One aspect of the budgetary decisions was to increase the pupil teacher ratio for fee-charging schools.

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process.  My predecessor was anxious to make funding available to as many organisations as possible within the prevailing resource constraints and approved 55 applications for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.<br\/><br\/>While it was known that the existing scheme was ending on 30 June 2014 and applications were sought for the new scheme with no guarantee of continued funding, it is clear that organisations had become increasingly dependent on this funding. Against that background, I announced, on 18 July 2014, the allocation of bridging funding of &euro;1.4 m to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations for a twelve month period, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. My Department has now commenced a process of engagement with the Department of Health in order to advance the review, which is being undertaken in agreement with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with Special Responsibility for Primary Care, Mental Health and Disability. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and\u00a0avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. Following on from the initial contacts with the Department of Health, my officials have now started the process of engagement with that Department with a view to provision of appropriate support to organisations beyond June 2015. It is intended to complete and publish the outcome of the review in due course.<br\/><br\/>This bridging funding in 2014\/2015 is a once-off transitional arrangement and will enable\u00a0organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the Scheme to Support National Organisations.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to his or her being liable to pay the charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such charge or fee, remains unpaid.<br\/><br\/>Part 12 of The Local Government Reform Act 2014, deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen. There are no plans to revise this legislation.<br\/><br\/>A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.<br\/><br\/>My Department undertook an initial media campaign when the NPPR Charge was first introduced in 2009. Nationwide advertising has also taken place in each year since the introduction of the Charge under the auspices of the local authorities to ensure general awareness of the Charge and the liability dates. In addition, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally. The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign this year aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates.<br\/><br\/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  All non-compliant owners to should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make their outstanding payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Library Services Provision","counter":4069,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA05150"},{"type":"question","counter":4070,"qnumday":1457,"qnumall":"[33947\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA05300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set out the number of libraries nationally that have had to cut the number of days per week that they are open to the public due to the recruitment embargo - some libraries are now only open three days per week; her views on whether this is acceptable in view of the fact that front-line services were not to be affected by the embargo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4071,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 30 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper which sets out the position in this matter.<br\/><br\/>My Department does not collate the specific information sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":4072,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA05425"},{"type":"question","counter":4073,"qnumday":1458,"qnumall":"[33987\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700100#WRAAA05450","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set out the steps he will take to protect from eviction the tenants living in the homes that are part of Ulster Bank's sale of non-performing home loans, Project Aran; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4074,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented residential sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants relating to, <i>inter alia,<\/i>security of tenure and the termination of tenancies.

It was intended that these grants should be utilised to assist in the deployment of staff and the purchase of appropriate equipment to tackle the problem of fly tipping and small-scale illegal dumping in known problem areas within their functional areas. A total sum of &euro;750,000 was allocated to the 34 local authorities under the scheme. Measures eligible for funding included the purchase of mobile CCTV equipment and associated signage\/dummy boxes, training and deployment for local authority staff and the employment of external CCTV contractors.<\/p><p>  Also during 2012, my Department entered into a negotiated agreement with the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) to mount a national litter campaign in the print media, aimed specifically at tackling the issues of littering and illegal dumping. The NNI made available, free of charge, &euro;500,000 worth of advertising space to raise awareness of the damaging effects that fly tipping and small-scale illegal dumping have on our environment and our economy, particularly on the tourism and agriculture sectors.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment. The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.<br\/><br\/>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014, during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013. In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen. There are no plans to revise this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.

While it is a matter for Irish Water to comply with all national and European legislation in the discharge of its functions, the company has confirmed to my Department that it is satisfied that the selection and fitting of the boundary water meter boxes fully complies with international standards.  Irish Water monitors the installations by its contractors and can require the installation of a Grade B meter box if it is deemed necessary, as has happened in the particular case highlighted. It is important to note that this was a matter agreed between Irish Water and the customer in question and there was no Court ruling on the matter.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has informed my Department that it is carrying out a specific study in one DMA (District Metering Area) in Collinswood, Dublin 9 to assess the impact of the meter installation on flow and pressure. Meters used by Irish Water comply with the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) standard, OIML R49-1, which permits a pressure drop of 0.63 bars at the maximum flow rate of 2,500 litres per hour. This is considered to be higher than would ever be expected in a household supply. At most of the typical range of flows, 85% of which are up to 1,000 litres per hour to Irish homes, the drop in pressure across a water meter is less than 0.1 bar and is insignificant against a normal minimum target pressure of 1.5 bar.  Therefore, the meters being used have been shown to result in a pressure drop which is not significant in terms of customer pressure at normal flows and well within the international standard for such meters.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  I would consider any application received for a rate waiver scheme carefully. In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs. In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates. This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers.<\/p><p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive scheme which promotes the use of vacant commercial property. Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests. Unlike rates waiver schemes under section 2 of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, no ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.

It will provide greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision and, therefore, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.<\/p><p>  Effective from 1 July 2014, local authorities may vary the rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) in their administrative area for the following year by up to 15% of the basic rate of the Tax. The decision must be taken by resolution of the Council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September in order to apply for the following year.<\/p><p>  The Local Property Tax (Local Adjustment Factor) Regulations 2014 set out the process for local authorities who wish to vary their LPT basic rates, including the factors that they must consider and the type of public consultation that they should undertake as part of that process. As part of the public consultation process, local authorities must publish a notice inviting written submissions from the public in advance of a meeting to consider the setting of a local adjustment factor. This notice specifically welcomes submissions on the potential effects of varying the basic rate of the local property tax on businesses, individuals and local authority services.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the pressures on businesses and the challenging economic environment in which many property and business owners are operating at the present time. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities and all rates collected within a local authority area are spent in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation (ARV) they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.<\/p><p>  A key objective of the reorganisation of local governance structures is to reduce the burden on ratepayers and indeed taxpayers generally, by maximising efficiency. The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider their overall financial position as part of their budget deliberations and make decisions in respect of the mix of income and expenditure that they consider most appropriate for the following year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4127,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 1480 to 1483, inclusive, answered with Question No. 1451.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Applications","counter":4128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":4129,"qnumday":1484,"qnumall":"[33109\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline the status of an application to Mayo North East Leader Development Company by an organisation (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4130,"qnumday":1487,"qnumall":"[33124\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when a Leader funding application for a community group in County Mayo (details supplied) will be processed; if he will explain the delay in the application process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4131,"qnumday":1552,"qnumall":"[34114\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set out the current situation in respect of a Leader application (details supplied) in County Mayo; and the reason for the delay in processing same.

In addition, in recent months, my Department has received correspondence from Donegal County Council, from public representatives and from the Mica Action Group itself in connection with the alleged use of defective blocks in the construction of the houses in north Donegal which appear to be giving rise to structural problems in those homes. I also understood that the Mica Action Group met with a representative of the Pyrite Resolution Board earlier this year.<\/p><p>From the information provided, my Department understands that claims have been made which suggest that between 1,000 and 2,000 dwellings are affected in north Donegal. It is also suggested that the affected dwellings were constructed between 1999 and 2006. However, no evidence has been supplied to substantiate these figures nor is there definitive information as to the cause of the problem.<\/p><p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the relevant contracting parties, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and\/or their respective insurers and in the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered. It may also be the case that some of the homes affected are covered by a structural guarantee \/ structural insurance and homeowners may wish to pursue this avenue for redress. While I fully understand the extremely difficult and distressing situations that the affected householders in Donegal face, I believe that the responsible parties should take appropriate actions to provide remedies to their difficulties.<\/p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme. However, the provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance. The Pyrite Resolution Board has no powers to investigate the alleged use of defective blocks in the construction of the houses in County Donegal and I have no proposals to amend the Act in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme","counter":4146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB04050"},{"type":"question","counter":4147,"qnumday":1490,"qnumall":"[33139\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700101#WRBBB04100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline his plans to allow redress for homeowners who have already completed the overdue and necessary remedial works to their dwellings as a result of pyrite under the pyrite remediation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4148,"content":"<p>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework within which the pyrite remediation scheme must operate.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br\/><br\/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it has submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances. The CER is currently reviewing submissions received on the consultation and a determination will be made by the CER later this month. Full details of the CER public consultation are available on .<br\/><br\/>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the water charges plan, the CER must take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. There are no plans to provide additional allowances, other than those announced in the Government decision.<br\/><br\/>The CER intends to hold a public consultation on a new connection charging policy for customers of Irish Water later this year. Pending the outcome of this consultation, Irish Water will continue to levy connection charges on customers requiring such services at rates equivalent to the water and wastewater related development levies which the local authorities applied as at 31 December 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Eligibility","counter":4192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":4193,"qnumday":1505,"qnumall":"[33343\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to review the fixed-term tenant purchase scheme or other such schemes to allow persons who previously owned a home or who are non-first-time buyers to be allowed to engage in the purchase of property from a local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1060","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4194,"qnumday":1513,"qnumall":"[33425\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when local authorities will be told that they can put a scheme in place allowing tenants of local authority houses to purchase their homes.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4195,"qnumday":1527,"qnumall":"[33768\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the date on which a new tenant purchase scheme will be put in place for council tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4196,"qnumday":1550,"qnumall":"[34091\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to re-open the tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4197,"qnumday":1555,"qnumall":"[34128\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the timeframe for the introduction of a tenant purchase scheme as provided for in legislation earlier this year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4198,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1505, 1513, 1527, 1550 and 1555 together.<\/p><p>  Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for a new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.<br\/><br\/>Traditionally it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an ongoing basis; this is in part a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need. In February 2013, at the time of publication of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement,<\/i>a set of indicators was identified to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its ongoing extent, will support the implementation of realistic and practical solutions. The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) is now operational nationwide and will assist lead housing authorities in each of the 9 regions to report on these indicators. 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness. Quarterly reports from lead housing authorities are being published on my Department's website as soon as these are available. Reports in respect of the first 2 quarters are available at, .<br\/><br\/>Based on data recorded on PASS, a recent survey of lead housing authorities confirmed that 2,509 unique individuals utilised Section 10 funded emergency accommodation nationally during the week of 14 to 20 July 2014, and 23 of these individuals were recorded for County Meath. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the full implementation of PASS the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland<\/i>, which was published on 6 September 2012. This report indicated that a total of 64 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,744 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements. This report is available on CSO's website, <i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In February 2013, the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i>was published in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach, which is focused on accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.<br\/><br\/>On 20 May 2014, the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness<\/i>was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<br\/><br\/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and a copy of the Quarter 2 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Quality","counter":4231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06500"},{"type":"question","counter":4232,"qnumday":1519,"qnumall":"[33664\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is a lead problem in the water in an area (details supplied) in Dublin 5.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4233,"qnumday":1557,"qnumall":"[34140\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding water quality in an area (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1519 and 1557 together.<br\/><br\/>With effect from 1st January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the water charges plan to be prepared by Irish Water is subject to the approval of the CER.<br\/><br\/>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 micrograms per litre, which came into effect at the end of 2013. At this concentration, there is a risk of exceeding the limits wherever there is lead piping and in particular where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities. Irish Water is working on the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme.  The numbers currently being identified are about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections. Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections over the next ten years. Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term.<br\/><br\/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and shall ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. As a precaution, Irish Water recommends persons in premises that have lead piping, to flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using for drinking.<br\/><br\/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors.  I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.<br\/><br\/>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations.\u00a0 In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction of the supply by the water supplier.\u00a0 The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices.\u00a0 Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website (). Irish Water also publishes water quality results on its website .<br\/><br\/>I understand that lead exceedances have been reported to the EPA in recent years in one of the areas in question arising from samples taken at private dwellings. The EPA has indicated to my Department that, in each case, its investigations have concluded that Dublin City Council\/Irish Water took appropriate action and advice was given to the householders concerned. No water restriction has issued under the Drinking Water Regulations to consumers in either of the areas in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Administration","counter":4235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC06900"},{"type":"question","counter":4236,"qnumday":1520,"qnumall":"[33666\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC07000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the non-principal private residence charge in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":4237,"qnumday":1526,"qnumall":"[33766\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700102#WRCCC07100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the non-principal private residence charge in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1520 and 1526 together.<\/p><p>  The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides the legislative basis for the Non Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge.

The Housing Agency also holds 13 other unencumbered sites, which were previously held by the National Building Agency.<br\/><br\/>The LAGS was introduced in 2010 as part of revised arrangements for the funding of land for social housing purposes. A condition of the scheme requires the transfer of lands included in the scheme to the Housing Agency.<br\/><br\/>An estimated total loan value of &euro;162m was approved for inclusion in the Scheme in respect of 73 sites in nineteen local authority areas. The figure of &euro;162m includes &euro;111m in respect of 47 sites, where loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme. The remaining &euro;51m relates to 26 sites and is in the form of annuity loans with the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), for which local authorities are making repayments to the HFA and recouping these payments from my Department on condition that the site is fully transferred to the Housing Agency.<br\/><br\/>Currently 43, of the 73 LAGS sites have been fully transferred to the Housing Agency. Of these 43 sites, 36 were dealt with under the first iteration of the Scheme and have had their associated loans redeemed in full.

The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.

Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive a lesser allocation from LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014. 80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide additional funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.<\/p><p>  Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive additional income in 2015 from LPT compared to their 2014 General Purpose Grant. The Government has decided that these local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding. The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in their respective areas (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount. It will be a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend that discretionary funding.<\/p><p>  Local authority elected members have been given the power to decide whether or not to increase or decrease LPT rates by up to 15% for 2015 and must inform the Revenue Commissioners of their intentions by the end of September. In the event that a local authority decides to increase LPT rates, they will retain 100% of the additional LPT collected. Where a local authority decides to reduce LPT rates, the full cost of that reduction will be reflected in a reduced LPT allocation to that local authority.<\/p><p>  I have advised local authorities of their individual provisional LPT allocations for 2015.

The LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme form an important part of this process for rural communities.\u00a0 Following a comprehensive consultation and needs analysis process a draft Rural Development Programme for Ireland for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020, which included an outline of the LEADER element, was submitted to the European Commission in July 2014.  An iterative process involving the authorities in Ireland and the European Commission is now under way and the draft programme will be finalised taking account of the outcome of that engagement.<br\/><br\/>Separately, in the context of a further national consultation process, I am aware that questions have been raised regarding a number of issues, including the definition of sub-regional areas for LEADER purposes, and in this context I am currently considering a number of options.I am anxious that the implementation of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme reflects a community led approach in so far as is possible and in order to ensure this, each sub-regional area will be responsible for determining its own needs and outlining how it proposes to address those needs in its Local Development Strategy.  This approach will also apply to those areas that contain Gaeltacht and island communities and I encourage both of these communities to ensure that they engage fully with the Local Development Strategy development processes for their respective areas to ensure that their concerns are fully addressed. <br\/><br\/>I do not propose to be overly prescriptive on what should be contained in any given Local Development Strategy as I believe that this is contrary to the ethos of a community led local development approach.  In this context it will be largely down to  Local Action Groups to outline, in their strategies, how they propose to administer and manage the funding, including the locations of their operations, within the framework outlined in the selection process. <br\/><br\/>My Department is also considering all relevant options in relation to the financial management of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme with a view to ensuring that the system implemented is fair, effective and efficient.\u00a0 The definitive outline of the LEADER element is yet to be finalised and the maximum levels of funding, eligibility criteria and rates of aid for projects to be funded have yet to be decided.  A detailed set of operating rules and procedures will be prepared once the Programme has been agreed and approved by the European Commission.<br\/><br\/>It is important that the necessary time is taken to ensure that the systems that are established to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP are robust, inclusive and ensure that all of the funding available at a local level is maximised in support of the sustainable development of rural communities all over Ireland.\u00a0 Full clarity regarding the detail of the implementation systems being put in place will be made available as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700105#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":4332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700105#WRFF00913"},{"type":"question","counter":4333,"qnumday":1588,"qnumall":"[34519\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700105#WRFF01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total funding provided by his Department for new local authority housing for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; the plans to increase the allocation for new local authority housing in 2015 in view of the critical shortage of such accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":4334,"content":"<p>The funding provided by my Department to local authorities for new social housing construction and acquisitions in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and allocated for 2014, is as follows: <table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>FUNDING <br \/><br \/>PROVIDED\/ALLOCATED<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;189.2m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;116.6m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;83.3m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;55m <\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The above amounts are in addition to provision made in respect of other areas of social housing provision, such as assistance for approved housing bodies and regeneration schemes.<br\/><br\/>The allocation to be provided to local authorities for social housing purposes in 2015 will be determined in the course of the 2015 estimates process.

The report examined each option in terms of both insurance and custodial type schemes. <br\/><br\/>In a custodial scheme, tenancy deposits are transferred to the scheme for the duration of the tenancy.  They are then repaid by the scheme operator following agreement between the landlord and tenant or following the outcome of a dispute resolution process in cases where there is no agreement.

In an insurance-based scheme, the landlord pays a premium to insure the risk of the deposit not being returned but retains the deposit.

The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. The fire services in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick are staffed on a full-time basis; Galway, Waterford, Drogheda and Dundalk have a combined full-time and retained service; fire services in all other communities are provided with the retained staffing system, which operates on the basis of alerting staff in response to 999 calls and mobilising brigades.  All fire services, full-time and retained, are mobilised on the basis of pre-determined attendances (PDAs), which set out the number and type of fire appliances and the associated crews, to be dispatched initially to the incident. The PDA depends on the type of incident and its location and may be varied by the Incident Commander. <br\/><br\/>  In February 2013, <i>Keeping Communities Safe<\/i><i>(KCS)<\/i>was published which, as national policy, is intended to keep fire safety and fire services in Ireland in line with international best practice.

The Scientific Committee annual assessments are carried out with reference to the established Conservation Limit (CL) for each individual river.

","asker":"1100","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":4429,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1626 and 1632 together.  <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas. The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<\/p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated. Commercial operators have invested, or are committing to invest approximately &euro;2.5 billion in upgrading telecommunications networks and services. I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 21 fibre-based broadband networks in County Laois and 17 fibre-based broadband networks in County Offaly by July 2016. In addition, the announcement of a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband in both Portlaoise and Tullamore. Previous interventions by the State have also delivered Metropolitan Area Networks to four towns in Offaly and one in Laois which are providing advanced services in Edenderry, Birr, Tullamore and Portlaoise. There is also a Metropolitan Area Network capacity situated in Banagher, Co. Offaly.<\/p><p>  While the accelerated commercial investment is welcome, it is largely focussed on cities and larger towns. The intervention strategy envisaged by Government recognises that quality broadband is a priority service for a 21st Century society. Central to the strategy therefore will be a major infrastructure build, which is likely to be primarily fibre-based. This will be designed to ensure that high quality broadband services are available in all parts of Ireland that cannot be served by the commercial sector.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list of areas has already been identified. It includes 20 areas in County Laois and 28 areas in County Offaly.<\/p><p>  As part of the mapping process, a stakeholder consultation was launched in June with a deadline of mid-September for submissions. I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year. Details of the areas requiring State intervention will not be confirmed until then. A further public consultation on the proposed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015.<\/p><p>  EU State Aid clearance will be required for the proposed State intervention. My Department will be working closely with the EU Commission on this important aspect of the programme.<\/p><p>  Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way. Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700106#WRGGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Broadcasting Charge","counter":4430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700106#WRGGG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":4431,"qnumday":1627,"qnumall":"[33061\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700106#WRGGG03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the proposed public service broadcasting charge, if he has considered different charging structures for commercial premises from those levied on residential properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":4432,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) Charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content or services.In line with these commitments, my Department is involved in the ongoing analysis and policy development work that is necessary in advance of the implementation of any changes that may be required.

Responsibility for the regulation of these markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. Prices are deregulated in the retail electricity and gas markets.<br\/><br\/>At a national level, the competitive energy market in place results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Such competition places downward pressure on prices. Consumers can try to mitigate rising electricity prices by shopping around and measures such as comparison websites, approved by the CER, exist to assist them. They can and should shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers.<br\/><br\/>The CER is focussed on actions that can mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.<br\/><br\/>Households can reduce their energy costs by being energy efficient. There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.

The new Code will be independently audited to ensure that all energy suppliers are complying with it.

The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate.

Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system. <\/p><p>  Currently the REFIT schemes are the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind and are paid for by electricity customers through the Public Service Obligation. In this regard, the forthcoming Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT supports for electricity generated from biomass.<\/p><p>  The choice of technology is, however, ultimately a commercial decision for individual project developers and the fuel used in the power plant at Moneypoint is a matter for the operator and I have no role or function in this regard. No studies have been undertaken by my Department on the potential or otherwise of converting the plant to use biomass.<\/p><p>  However, I am currently in the process of developing a new Energy Policy White Paper which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy for the next number of years. To facilitate the development of the new White Paper, a Green Paper was published in May 2014 commencing a public consultation period that concluded on 31 July and one of the questions raised in the Green Paper related to the future of Moneypoint. Some 1,200 submissions were received on the Green Paper as part of that process and my Department is currently reviewing the submissions received.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, analysis of options for increased use of renewable energy as we approach 2020 and beyond is ongoing, with a view to ensuring that our ambition is both sustainable, and economically and technically feasible. For example, analysis is being undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER to further assess the costs and benefits associated with achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remains at 2013 levels. <\/p><p>  There is also potential to increase the diversity of our renewable electricity generation portfolio in the period beyond 2020. To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), published earlier this year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that at least 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy Review","counter":4510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH03050"},{"type":"question","counter":4511,"qnumday":1655,"qnumall":"[34603\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has examined the contents of the BW Energy response to the Irish Government's consultation on the May 2014 Green Paper on Irish energy policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This programme is being managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on behalf of my Department. <br\/><br\/>Significant progress has been made in recent years but it is accepted that more work remains\u00a0to be done. All Iarnrod Eireann&rsquo;s operational rolling stock is internally accessible with the use of a portable wheelchair ramp at all stations.\u00a0I understand that\u00a0Iarnrod Eireann will ensure that a member of staff is available to help a wheelchair user once they receive 24 hours notice\u00a0of the times of both the\u00a0inward and outward journeys.\u00a0Over 55% of existing stations have also received significant accessibility upgrades.\u00a0At the request of the NTA, Iarnrod Eireann is preparing a report \u00a0on rail station accessibility\u00a0and this will focus on low-cost solutions to achieve wheelchair access to station platforms on a priority basis. <br\/><br\/>The Dublin Bus fleet and Bus &Eacute;ireann urban fleets in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo are 100% wheelchair accessible. With regard to Dublin Bus, I understand their\u00a0newer\u00a0buses have\u00a0one \u00a0wheelchair space plus one\u00a0buggy space and these spaces are also\u00a0more clearly marked. There is\u00a0a refurbishment programme of 255 access ramps on buses underway, the majority of which\u00a0are now complete.\u00a0The use of on-board announcements on Dublin Bus is\u00a0being introduced which will be particularly beneficial to the visually impaired.\u00a0Dublin Bus also receives funding for a Travel Assistant Scheme to help those members of public who need help to access public transport and I understand this scheme continues to be well received.<br\/><br\/>While\u00a056% of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s coach fleet is wheelchair accessible,\u00a0an accessible service is only available on a limited number of routes.\u00a0This is currently being addressed\u00a0as part of the accessibility grants programme A number of accessible bus stops have been approved for upgrade in 2014 and this work\u00a0is being progressed. The NTA has also undertaken\u00a0a national\u00a0audit\u00a0of bus stops and bus stations which is close to completion which\u00a0will facilitate the development a priority plan for further accessibility improvements.<br\/><br\/>With regard to accessible taxis, the NTA has\u00a0recently launched a new &euro;1m grant scheme to support the wider availability of Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) in Ireland&rsquo;s taxi fleet. Interest in the scheme has been good to date.<br\/><br\/>The potential for technology developments to\u00a0help people with disabilities access transport services is also kept under review. \u00a0Examples of this include the Real Time Ireland App which\u00a0is\u00a0&lsquo;text to speech enabled&rsquo; to help the visually impaired.\u00a0The Real Time signs also indicate the arrival of low-floor buses for wheelchair users. The NTA is also enhancing the National Journey Planner to allow a request for a step-free journey which will assist those with a mobility impairment to plan their public transport journeys.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>I am committed\u00a0to the on-going improvement of access to public transport for\u00a0persons with disabilities and will continue\u00a0to provide capital funds for this purpose as part of the relevant capital plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parking Regulations","counter":4544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH05450"},{"type":"question","counter":4545,"qnumday":1667,"qnumall":"[32916\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700107#WRHHH05500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 670 of 24 June 2014, his plans to introduce regulations permitting local authorities to introduce by-laws that would designate electric vehicle charging points on public roads as electric vehicle parking only, as well as permitting local authorities to assign dedicated public parking spaces as car club only spaces; and the reasons for delay in same.

The NTA has undertaken\u00a0an audit\u00a0of bus stops and bus\/rail stations which is close to completion and this work\u00a0will facilitate the\u00a0 development a priority plan for further accessibility improvements.<br\/><br\/>The NTA has also recently launched a new &euro;1m grant scheme to support the wider availability of Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) in Ireland&rsquo;s taxi fleet. Interest in the scheme has been good to date.<br\/><br\/>The potential for technology developments to\u00a0help people with disabilities access transport services is also kept under review. \u00a0Examples of this include the Real Time Ireland App which\u00a0is\u00a0&lsquo;text to speech enabled&rsquo; to help the visually impaired.\u00a0The Real Time signs also indicate the arrival of low floor buses for wheelchair users. The NTA is also enhancing the National Journey Planner to allow a request for a step-free journey which will assist those with a mobility impairment to plan their public transport journeys.\u00a0The use of on-board announcements on Dublin Bus is also being introduced which will be particularly beneficial to the visually impaired.<br\/><br\/>I am committed\u00a0 to the ongoing improvement of\u00a0access to public transport for\u00a0persons with disabilities and will continue\u00a0to provide capital funds for this purpose as part of the relevant capital plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700108#WRJJJ06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Eligibility","counter":4610,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700108#WRJJJ06400"},{"type":"question","counter":4611,"qnumday":1691,"qnumall":"[33560\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091700108#WRJJJ06500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding funding in respect of a club (details supplied) in Dublin 3; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":4612,"content":"<p>The Sports Capital Programme is the Government&rsquo;s primary vehicle for supporting the development of sports facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.\u00a0\u00a0It is open to any sports club or organisation with a suitable project to apply\u00a0for funding under the next round of the Programme.<br\/><br\/>My Department has developed a new portal on the Department's website which must be used by organisations to register, to apply for funding (when the next Programme is open for applications) and to manage the drawdown of any new grants allocated after 2013.\u00a0 Any interested\u00a0organisation should register\u00a0on .<br\/><br\/>It may be possible for the club to raise funds via the &lsquo;Tax Relief for Donations to Certain Sports Bodies&rsquo; scheme (section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997).

With regard to the capital budget for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I wish to again reiterate that, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas. In that context, I wish to again acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.   <\/p><p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's end of year statement for 2013 indicated that the rate of job losses in its client companies had reached a record low. This was very welcome news indeed. However, while the level of job losses has stabilised, I am very cognisant of the ongoing difficult challenge in creating a sufficient number of new jobs to maintain, and indeed increase, employment levels in the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>  I am, of course, aware of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's proposal to increase its capital budget over time from the present level of &euro;5.687m to &euro;12m per annum. I am also very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, it was announced as part of Budget 2014 that comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure would be undertaken by all Government Departments during 2014. These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities. I understand that the reviews were completed and will be considered by Government with a view to underpinning expenditure ceilings for 2015 and beyond, as well as clarifying policy options and informing prioritisation decisions arising from the expenditure ceilings. Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of the Budgetary and Estimates processes later this year.<\/p><p>  Foras na Gaeilge is one of the agencies of An Foras Teanga, the North South Language Body, and its budget must accordingly be approved by the North South Ministerial Council.

Since the introduction of this compensation provision in 1997, fewer than 20 individual applicants have sought and been paid compensation, and these related predominantly to commercial peat extraction.
