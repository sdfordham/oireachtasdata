I welcome the opportunity to address, together with my colleagues, any inquiries the committee may have on the scoping notes that it is preparing on land use.  We will be glad to also send the names of all of the participants after the meeting in case members have subsequent questions.  My brief introductory points would like to link this to the recently agreed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and its relevance for the committee's inquiry.  In order to leave most of the time available for discussion and answer questions in detail, I will focus on the broader context of the reform, its main EU-wide elements and the flexibilities left to member states for implementation.<\/p><p>  In terms of the broader context of the reform, concerns that characterised the recent past on price volatility have subsided to some extent.  The level of prices for most agricultural products continues to be high by all historical standards or previous expectations.  This is an important element in the understanding of developments in agriculture.  It reflects both opportunities for agricultural products in export markets, linked to world demand prospects.  Also, it challenges for their supply of these products with respect for productivity and the sustainable use of natural resources.  This is especially the result of the increase in costs of production due to their link to energy, and other input prices.<\/p><p>  Within this environment of a changing world market situation, different sets of policy parameters were analysed, and the policy challenges that these developments posed were reflected in the decision to \"green\" the CAP.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that the reform orientation is relevant to the scoping paper, since these developments have brought into the forefront a dilemma faced by all farmers on how to optimise the use of natural resources and especially the use of land.  Faced with high production costs linked to energy and other inputs, including fertilisers, the short-term temptation for producers is to ignore environmental concerns since markets do not compensate for the environment.  From a long-term perspective, this would be detrimental to the capacity of land to support production sustainably.  To address this dilemma, unlike farm policy developments in other parts of the world, the CAP reform put at the forefront of its policy design a paradigm shift of policy instruments that tried to address the need for the joint delivery of the public and the private good from agriculture.  CAP reform turned land into the basic reference for the receipt of payments, land use into a condition and land use change into a policy target and long-term objective.<br\/>&ldquo;Greening&rdquo;, that is the mandatory requirement for farmers to respect a minimum set of practices that are beneficial to the environment and to climate change action in order to receive part of their direct payment, is central to our approach.  However, this is not limited to the proposal that every farmer respect three mandatory measures linked to soil, carbon and biodiversity.  It is also accompanied by a series of other measures that aim to make greening more closely linked to the specific challenges facing European agriculture from climate change adaptation and mitigation to the adoption of innovations.  These are mainly measures contained in the rural development part of the reform package.  <br\/>The significant boost in agricultural research, involving a doubling of the fund in the community budget, which allows for research that is linked to practical questions that farmers face on the ground and improved knowledge transfer through a mandatory farm advisory system, are all elements that try to reverse the negative trends of the past that resulted in a slowdown of productivity growth in the European Union.  With this approach, price volatility is not essentially addressed as a problem to be resolved directly, which is an implicit recognition of the fact that is mainly driven by factors exogenous to agriculture, such as energy costs.  Rather, price volatility is addressed as a reality to which farmers have to adjust by retaining the basic layer of income support which mitigates the effects of price volatility but shifts the target away from references of past production levels towards references reflecting future production potential, thus linking payments to land and its use.<br\/>The final decision on CAP reform reflects the reality, not just for the EU but also for global agriculture, that in a world characterised by the complex interrelationship of so many factors affecting the food sector, it is not single isolated measures, but a set of coherent policy instruments reflecting the specificity of different regions that will maximise policy efficiency.  As a result, member states<b><\/b>are left with a wide array of flexibilities in terms of how to implement decisions related to the reform with respect to direct payment, with their choices to be notified to the Commission in most cases by 1 of August 2014.  With the basic and delegated acts now in place, focus now is on the final decisions of member states in terms of the implementation of the reform.<br\/>By the end of July, we expect to have the full picture on decisions with respect to direct payments on issues ranging from the redistribution of support and the allocation of entitlements, to the flexibility of shifting funds between pillars, that is, between direct payments and rural development.  Plans on rural development programmes and their link to other EU funds are at an advanced stage, or in certain cases already agreed.  All of these decisions will have a bearing on land and its use.<br\/>With this brief statement, I thank committee members for their attention and welcome again the opportunity for my colleagues and myself to contribute to their deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500003#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tassos Haniotis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Haniotis.

It is clear that there are differences among member states and that transport costs and other factors also play a role in price levels.  The other issue that is important has been referred to by the Deputy, namely, the fact that we do not know exactly how climate change is going to affect the production capacity of the European Union.  With our colleagues in the Joint Research Centre in both Seville in Spain and Ispra in Italy, we are trying to understand what agro-meteorological models are telling us about the potential impact of climate change in the short-term on various parts of the EU.  We have seen that one of the characteristics of climate change is that diseases - of both plants and animals - tend to spread much faster and the research capability to deal with them is lagging behind.  This is why we have decided to put more money into targeted agricultural research.  This is an area that will be given priority under the new agricultural research programmes.  The Deputy has raised an issue about which we have more questions than answers right now.  However, we will try to address it as soon as possible.   <\/p><p>  Mr. Bascou will now respond to the first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tassos Haniotis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401958200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The first question concerned the decisions of member states to provide additional support to specific areas, most notably high nature value farm land.  As Mr. Haniotis mentioned in his opening statement, member states have been given much more flexibility in terms of granting support to specific regions or for specific types of farmers, for example, young farmers.<\/p> <p>There is also the possibility of granting different types of direct payment.  With the new architecture of direct payment, there is a possibility of better targeting certain types of farmers, regions or farming.  There is also Pillar 2.  Unfortunately, right now we do not have a clear idea about the work member states will do.  If I refer to the direct payment scheme, member states must notify the Commission on the decision regarding the allocation of the funding under the direct payments scheme, in particular how they will implement greening and how they will allocate funding to the voluntary support system to the areas of natural constraint.  This must be done by 1 August 2014.  I think members states will notify the Commission of their decisions by 1 August.  We are also in the process of examining further measures related to the Pillar 2, such as voluntary measures that the members states can allocate certain types of support for Natura 2000 and for those who farm what we term areas of natural constraint.  It is complementary to direct payment.<\/p><p> We are also in the process of examining the proposals sent by member states in the context of the programme.  At this stage it is difficult to give Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill a proper answer.  However, I would like to mention that flexibility is given and in addition the portfolio policy instrument is much broader now than it has been in the past in order to target and grant specific support in areas where production conditions are more difficult.  Many of the new measures are on a voluntary basis and it is left up to member states to decide how to target support and whether they want to target these regions or not.  An element which is possible, but in my view from what we have heard should not be implemented in Ireland, is also to implement the EU direct payments scheme.  That means creating different regions with a specific level of support.  From what we have heard, this may not be the chosen path, but there are other measures within the direct payment and the Pillar 2 that will enable us to target specific regions but so far nothing officially has been sent in terms of a notification, either through Pillar 1 or Pillar 2.  We will have a much better idea at the end of the summer following notification on 1 August and full information concerning the rural development programme, which most likely will be finalised at the end of 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500004#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Bascou","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401958800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I come from the north west, the Border region of County Leitrim.

The main concern being expressed in my locality is that the Government may award mining licences.  Fracking is very controversial as the use of chemicals in the process of fracturing may affect water courses.  If the delegates look at the map of Ireland, they will see the many lakes in the region where tourism is the mainstay of the economy.  People across several counties in the region known as the Lough Allen basin, Lough Allen being the first lake on the River Shannon, are concerned about what would happen to the water courses if mining were to proceed.  We have been keeping a close eye on the Commission's attitude to fracking and this might be an opportunity to express an opinion on the way Europe views this as the issue encompasses all three directorates.  I am aware that subsidiarity could come into play and that the issue may be left to national governments to decide because of the drive to alternative energy and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.

Basically, the provision of public good in certain areas will be intensification in other areas.  At the outset, what we would like to achieve is a new CAP of reform.  Nobody at EU level is out to oppose competitiveness and intensification with the provision of public good, but to promote both.  We want an agricultural sector which is competitive in the medium term and over the long term, but at the same time it should be sustainable in terms of management of natural resources, social aspects and in maintaining and developing improvements in rural areas.  It must also be sustainable in an economic dimension.<\/p><p>  This is why with the introduction of what we called the greening obligation in Pillar 1, we have introduced public support for the provision of public goods, both in Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, in an integrated and complementary manner.  Therefore, whether a farmer decides to intensify or extend his production, he will have to respect some environmental conditions and some production method which will be beneficial for climate change.  What we would like to do is to reach the two objectives of competitiveness and sustainability.  Therefore, when we talk about biodiversity or soil quality, we want to have public support that will promote the production of private goods and agricultural products, such as cereals, meat and dairy produce, and also promote the maintenance, development and quality of natural resources, in particular biodiversity and soil quality.<\/p><p>  The first question related to grass.  This is a measure which is being proposed by Ireland in the context of Pillar 2.  The EU supports this measure as it is one which will promote an increase in the development of grass production in a system which is beneficial for the environment.  We are in the process now of examining and approving the rural development programme for the member states and our colleagues are examining this type of measure.  If the Irish public administration, as per the measure, fulfils the necessary conditions in regard to implementation, approval of the area targeted, premium labour and delivery of sufficient public good, we will definitely approve of it and we will encourage farmers - although it will be voluntary - to enter the scheme.  However, this scheme must be seen as complementary or additional to what is already foreseen in Pillar 1, namely, the maintenance and protection of permanent grassland.<\/p><p>  The possibility for countries, a possibility Ireland may envisage, will be for them to protect not only at national level, with control at macro level, but to protect at parcel levels, such as specific sites on the ground.  These sites might be certain grassland sites which are important for carbon sequestration, for biodiversity purposes and for the quality of water.  Countries, Ireland in particular, have the possibility in Natura 2000 areas, but also in other important areas, such as peatland or other types of permanent grassland, to do something in Pillar 2 which will complement what has been done in Pillar 1.<\/p><p>  I have already addressed the other question, but I will repeat that we do not want to oppose the two concepts or place environment against production.  What we want to achieve is what we called \"greening\" in Pillar 1, which we tried to achieve through the green payments.  In Pillar 2, we have agri-environmental measures and we hope both of these measures will build on each other and deliver both sustainability and competitiveness.<\/p><p>  One other element we should mention is the measure related to the advisory system, which is also linked to cross-compliance.  We have a system of cross-compliance which has been streamlined and better targeted, but it should also enable farmers, with an increased level of support, to enhance significantly the delivery of environmental public goods in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Bascou"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401959400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Let me clarify that the one thing that is mandatory is the farm advisory system.  The reason for this is very much linked to the point made by Mr. Bascou, namely, the need to deliver both the private and the public good.  We have been telling farmers that they need to produce more with less.  This is a general statement, but the question is how to do it.  In each member state conditions are very different, not only at national level, but at regional level.  This is why, with cross-compliance, good agricultural and environmental conditions are regionalised.  We do things differently where there is a lot of water and very differently where there is not so much rain.<\/p><p>  What we want to do is to have, in every member state, a system where the obligation on the member state will be to provide advice to farmers when they ask specific questions linked to good agricultural and environmental conditions.  The set of questions on which member states should provide an answer is limited.  However, the question is how can they provide information on something that member states do in very different ways.   Some member states are doing it through their ministries of agriculture, others doing it through private advice sessions in which farmers participate and others combine a mixture of farm organisations and universities.  It is not Brussels that will decide on how advice is provided.  Member states must do that. <\/p><p>  What we want to ensure is that every member states chooses what is most pertinent for it.  Farmers can go to them and ask for this information.<\/p> <p>Then we will make a decision based on the additional money we have for research and the specific questions we target for this research that are very much linked to the issues related to greening and increasing productivity.  Furthermore, the innovation partnership brings existing knowledge to the forefront.  For example, a farmer who moves into greening would be able to use information on precision agriculture.<\/p><p> Why did we move with a requirement relating to crop diversification?  It is not because farmers do not know how to do it.  It is because we have seen, especially on large farms, cases of monoculture.  If there is monoculture then in the short term the farmer increases productivity because he decreases the cost of production, but in the longer term this has an impact on the capacity of land to produce and it also impacts on soil erosion.  This is why putting or forcing farmers to move in a direction of crop diversification comes in parallel with additional advice on how exactly to do it, why it makes sense to do it and how to move or transition in a way that would allow them to do better.<\/p><p> We know of the best practices applied in member states that have worked well.  What we wish to do, especially with the innovation partnership, is allow this knowledge to be transferred.  Someone put it well recently in a conference I attended on research.  He said it was a case of money that brings knowledge and innovation and knowledge that brings money.  There is a gap between the time when we put in money for research and the time that the knowledge will come.  Sometimes existing knowledge in other member states or in other parts of the same member state could be transferred better to farmers and a farmer advisory system could play an important role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500006#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tassos Haniotis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401960000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I will follow up on what has been said in the last two contributions.  The Directorate-General for the Environment also supports a type of system the purpose of which is not so much to separate out high nature value farming areas or areas of high biodiversity from areas of high agricultural production.  We see this system, as it has been described, working such that we can characterise agricultural land as having different possibilities, including possibilities to provide services.  Let us link this back to the provision of information and knowledge services.  One thing we really need to be able to inform the farmer about is information.  We believe it is essential to have knowledge of the services that ecosystems can provide.  We know a process is being undertaken as part of the European Union biodiversity 2020 strategy, which has been translated into member state strategies, to gather up this type of information.  This information allows us to understand the environment in totality and, within that, to understand what ecosystem services can be provided, such as, for example, the provision of food.  However, it also allows us to understand how to regulate services dealing with air, soil, water, climate and the possibility for cultural services.  When we understand this and have all this information, we can then understand the trade-offs that are necessary and the ability to increase production in land suitable for intensified production.  Furthermore, we can see that there may be places where it is more suitable to provide regulatory or cultural services.  The administration and the people involved in managing agriculture at least have all this information at hand and, therefore, they have the ability to make the decisions and trade-offs that are needed.  This relates back to Deputy Pringle's question as well as the overall question on how to sustainably intensify production on land, as called for in the Food Harvest 2020 policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1401960000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Commission representatives for their presentations this morning.  We have a difficulty at times in bringing farmers with us because in their experience, environmental measures do not always make sense.  Farmers are custodians of the land and pride themselves on minding the land better than most.  There are environmental issues such as calendar farming, which results in restrictions on slurry spreading at certain times.  There are stipulations on when farmers can plough ground and this does not make sense to them when, potentially, there will be a very dry time ahead but the weather may be conducive for that activity now and yet it is not allowed.  Conversely, it may be allowed during a very wet time and farmers are obliged to go out with their slurry at that stage.  There is a difficulty for us in explaining to farmers that it is a common sense environmental approach.<\/p><p>  At the same time we have a good tradition, through cross-compliance and our engagement with the likes of the rural environment protection scheme, in terms of how well we have bought into environmental projects in the past.  We have seen it more recently with the agri-environment options scheme and this will continue this in future.  We have to get the balance right in being able to expand, as we hope to do with our dairy and beef industries, and in respect of the comments of the Commission representatives on flexibility around a regional ecological approach, which is very important to us given that this is a relatively small country.<\/p><p>  My final question is on forestry in light of the new EU forestry strategy and sustainable forestry management.  Ireland has continued to invest in forestry in recent years in a difficult economic climate and when it was difficult for our Minister to fight for the budget.  Will the Commission representatives outline their view on our afforestation programme in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500007#H00300","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1401960000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I wish to go back to the comments the Commission representative made regarding monoculture.  Perhaps there is a lack of understanding in this case.  Let us consider the greatest problems we face.  Most of our land is in grass.  Therefore, it is as green as it is going to get.  In the case of our cereal lands, the biggest problem we have is the size of our fields.  They are rather small.  In European terms, they are minuscule.  They are fragmented.  This means we are travelling long distances between fields.  We do not have a choice of crops.  We have barley, wheat and oats.  Beans are rather marginal because they harvest late.  Oilseed rape for oil is almost a non-runner.  It would be wrong to go away from this meeting thinking that we have a choice, because we do not.  Now, we are faced with ecological focus areas.  It seems strange that we will be going back to setting aside land and tillage because of this, yet most of our land in the country is green anyway.<\/p><p>  Another key issue we have does not really pertain to land use but to the age of our farmers.  The active farming population in Ireland is dropping rapidly.  When people hear the term \"cross-compliance\" in this country, all they think of is fines.  We have a situation whereby our advice agencies are advising our farmers but it turns out that when cross-compliance is put in place, fines are being delivered.  We need to move from a situation whereby cross-compliance is seen as a threat towards one where it is a help to farmers.  The Commission representatives should not go away from this meeting thinking it is straightforward when they refer to monoculture and so on.  We have a small cereal industry.  Our field sizes are small and our land is fragmented.  Ireland is unique across Europe because of these constraints.  It is amazing that we have a tillage industry at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500007#H00400","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1401960000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I concur with what my colleague, Deputy Tom Barry, has said.  We are significantly different in terms of crop diversity and potential from what prevails more commonly at European level.  The Commission representative referred to the fact that the farmers involved get a better understanding of the 2020 policy of the land and its potential, its potential for diversity and biodiversity and all of that.  Surely the farmers are the people who know.  As Deputy Heydon said, they are the custodians of the land and no one knows the land better.  It is a problem - it has been reflected in recent times - of a disconnect between thinking and policies at EU level.  Often, this is evinced by European Commission representatives and it can be very annoying.  The fact is there is an over-emphasis on prescriptive policies emanating from the directorates-general, whether those responsible for environment, agriculture or anywhere else in Europe, and such policies are over-circumscribed.<\/p> <p> Deputy Barry is correct that when we speak of cross-compliance in Ireland only fines, penalties and the like are mentioned.  Irish farmers are trying to balance increased intensive production with the environmental protection measures that they have adopted.  They do not merely pay lip-service to these measures.  Their goal is to protect the environment and pass their land on to future generations in a well-preserved state.  Some of the policies emanating from the European Commission are more theoretical than practical and it is time more attention was paid to the efforts that have been made here in Ireland.  These efforts should be recognised because it seems that often policies are largely intended as being more punitive than helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500007#H00500","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401960600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, still begins with the letter \"C\".  That is to say, it still a common policy that must engage member states.  The last two points raised the important question of how a common policy can be designed without over-emphasising details that do not allow for regional and national characteristics.  It is easy to recognise this but difficult to put it into practice.  Mr Bascou and I were heavily involved in the analysis of background information to prepare the proposal and a person engaging in this kind of analysis will see that serious efforts were made to avoid being prescriptive.  However, negotiations in the process of co-decision making saw that many details that were not intended by us ended up in the delegated Act.  This has made things more difficult than initially intended for member states and the European Commission.  Some member states had particular interests so in the negotiation process we tried to incorporate well-intentioned concerns but this made things more complex for member states and the European Commission.  We faced this reality with previous reforms and always improved the situation.  On this occasion it was more complicated because both member states and the European Parliament were involved.  The point raised by Deputy Penrose is valid and we strive not to be prescriptive.<\/p><p>  Points were raised relating to structural changes and the age of farmers and these are issues throughout European agriculture.  The only factor that has helped European agriculture to improve productivity is the fact that fewer farmers are using the same amount of land as previously.  This is an unfortunate reality as we might have expected increased productivity from other areas, such as capital and land.  Only a fall in labour has brought about these improvements and this raises the question of what to do with people who are leaving employment in agriculture.  How many of these people will stay in rural areas and what alternative job opportunities exist?  This cannot be addressed only through rural development measures but requires a wide array of structural and other funds that should aim at improving the rural economy and helping agriculture to adjust to change.  This is why there are now stronger links between the uses of various community funds, including structural, employment and agricultural funds.  It helps us reach common targets in a co-ordinated and consistent way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tassos Haniotis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401960600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>As my colleague, Mr. Haniotis, mentioned, the last two issues raised are very important.  It is a concern that policy increasingly seems not to make sense to citizens of member states.  The new co-decision process has complicated matters in terms of the delivery and final outcome of a legislative framework.  There are now 28 member states, including Croatia which I visited recently.  The needs of Croatian farmers and Croatian regions are very different from those in France and Ireland.  We came to Ireland with the European Commission on three occasions in the past two years to discuss and negotiate reform of the CAP.  It is clear the every country is unique within the European Union, EU.  It is becoming very difficult for us and for the European Commission to design a policy that meets the needs of farmers and rural areas.  It must be a policy that is common but also manageable because it requires the money of EU taxpayers.  It is a difficult process that is complicated by the fact that the CAP deals not only with food production but also the management of natural resources, territorial matters and health issues that are viewed differently across the EU.  The point made by Deputy Penrose is very important but it is essential to see things from this side of the table also.  It has raised eyebrows in recent months but the new CAP will give more flexibility to member states and regions, I insist on the use of the word \"regions\", to tailor the policy framework and instruments to the needs of farmers and economic agents in rural areas.  This is at the heart of our work but if we give more flexibility we must ensure there is a level playing field for farmers and companies in rural areas.  There must be no major distortion of competition between areas.  The aim is to ensure that what is put in place will address the overall objective of the CAP.<\/p><p>  I will now address the issues of monoculture and ecological focus areas, EFA.  It is clear that there is much grassland in Ireland, whether permanent or temporary.  We are not targeting grassland.  By seeking to introduce crop diversification to farming methods we are targeting arable land producers that maintain monoculture.  In the south of France maize producers provide a good example.  Monoculture has existed there for many years and has major environmental consequences.  It is not just a matter of helping the environment, we are talking about food production and potential harvests in the medium term.  If we want to ensure the production potential of the EU in five, ten and 20 years we must ensure sustainable management of natural resources like soil.  We must ensure biodiversity thrives and farmers have the tools of production and are best placed to do so.  Some parts of Europe have experienced problems in this regard and we are trying to address them.  In other parts of the EU there is no need for such eco-diversification because there is much grassland.<\/p> <p>In addition, farms are very small in size.  This is why there are a certain number of derogations in respect of the greening obligation under Pillar 1.  These derogations relate specifically to grassland.  More than 75% of grassland is exempted from the obligation relating to crop diversification.  If a farmer has fewer than 10 ha, his or her property will be exempted.  If he or she has fewer than 20 ha, he or she will be obliged to meet only certain aspects of the crop diversification obligation.  There is some flexibility and also a derogation in order to make this obligation adaptable and meaningful in countries across the entire EU.<\/p><p> The position is the same with regard to ecological focus areas, EFAs.  The obligations relating to the latter only apply to farms with more than 15 ha of arable land and not to other types of farm.  Reference was made to set-aside.  We wish to re-emphasise that introducing a minimum level of EFAs at farm level is a way to protect and better deal with the non-productive land on farms.  Part of every farm, whether it is land on which there is a pond or whatever, is not used for agricultural production.  What we would like is to better take into account these parts of farms, which are often excluded under the payment rules that currently apply.  We would like to protect it and, if possible, reintroduce it.  It is not a question of setting aside productive land.  It is a question of better utilising that which is not currently used for production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014060500008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Bascou","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401961200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The EU has a strategy in place, the aim of which is to ensure the long-term and sustainable use of our forestry resources.  The expansion of forested areas by means of afforestation is seen as extremely positive.  The interest in afforestation is quite different across the various member states.  Some with very large areas of forestry possibly have less space available for afforestation.  In Ireland, however, it seems there is some scope for increasing the area of land covered by forests.  Rural development policy provides a means for supporting afforestation, forest environmental measures can also be supported and investments can be made in respect of existing forestry.  There are support possibilities and this is mainly because it is recognised that forests play a multifunctional role.  For example, afforestation can represent the most economic use of certain land.  At the same time, however, there are always environmental considerations such as water stabilisation and biodiversity benefits.  In addition, forests can be used to produce biomass which is then used to generate bioenergy.<\/p><p>  Afforestation also gives rise to impacts in the context of climate.  For example, the level of carbon sequestration increases as the amount of land under forest increases.  There is a framework in place that will ensure that the climate benefit and mitigation effects associated with afforestation, including the amount of carbon stored in sinks on forested land, will be taken into account by 2020.

Most of the decisions relating to forestry will be taken at member state level.  As my colleagues have pointed out, the reformed CAP provides a broad set of measures and flexibilities for member states in regard to the twin challenges of agriculture and also forestry.  More specifically, and as Mr. Gumbert explained, afforestation - particularly that relating to marginal land - can have a significantly positive value in terms of carbon sequestration.  As he also pointed out, we are currently implementing an accounting framework in order that we might take better account of this in the greenhouse gas inventories of the EU.

The information with which we have been provided is going to prove important in the context of our report.  I wish to point out that some members have been obliged to leave the meeting in order to attend proceedings in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, which is our Upper House.<\/p> <p>The fact that three areas of the Commission, namely, the environment, agriculture and climate, and in a wider context we could possibly include transport, are grouped together is important in trying to make everybody realise that with a greener Common Agricultural Policy, if it is implemented in terms of its objectives, agricultural production will definitely be achieved in a more sustainable manner within the EU and in a way that is very cognisant of the environment.  In Ireland, where we have 2020 greenhouse gas targets that were set some years ago, greenhouse gas emissions output from agriculture form a very high percentage of our overall emissions, as we, unlike some other member states, do not have heavy industry.  It is a simplistic objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in the national context.  If we do that, we will curb our potential under Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p> The motivation behind this body of work was to examine how those two seemingly irreconcilable targets work together and how can we make that happen.  We are trying to raise awareness that by simply curbing agricultural output in Ireland to meet a target figure, we will not achieve an improvement globally or even in the EU in reducing greenhouse gas emissions or in climate change mitigation.  Forestry is a very valuable part of the equation but it is not the only one.  It is important that this conservation has taken place with the representatives from the Commission's three sectors in the one room and that they have heard our arguments.  I anticipate that our position will be robustly articulated by our Minister and officials over there as well.<\/p><p>  For instance, Scotland has a climate change Bill, to which there is a land use policy module.  A member of our Library and Research Service attended a conference on it.  We could bring in a land use policy with a climate change module, but we are doing it slightly differently.  I think the representatives get the picture of what it is that we are trying to inform and convince the people of, namely, that we need to consider the way agriculture contributes to the Irish economy, not in a simplistic manner, and that with a green Common Agricultural Policy, agriculture does so sustainably.  It provides, be it in areas of high nature value or other areas, other good services to the public which should be rewarded in some way.  <\/p><p> In the context of the age profile of farmers, one of the main implementation objectives is land mobility, not ownership, that is, that land comes under the control of younger trained people with a business focus and also with a very strong sustainable production mindset.

We will set out two possible solutions that we have identified that could help credit unions to become more involved in providing finance for what is a vital sector in the future economic prosperity of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401958800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Mr. Brennan and I work for the Irish League of Credit Unions, the largest trade and representative body for credit unions in Ireland.  We have 376 affiliated credit unions in the Republic, all of which are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  We have approximately 100 more in Northern Ireland.  Credit unions in general have approximately 3 million members on the island.  This is the largest rate of penetration of credit union members anywhere in the world.  We have assets of approximately &euro;12.8 billion, of which only approximately &euro;3.8 billion are represented by loans.  This is a figure we would like to increase substantially.  When we factor in liquidity and prudential requirements for credit unions, we estimate that we have roughly &euro;5 billion of funds that are currently invested, mainly in deposit accounts in banks, that we would like to see put to better use, particularly in lending.  Lending to the SME sector could be a significant aspect.  Our long-term viability depends on achieving significant or reasonable loan growth in the medium to longer term.  We want to and need to lend and have funds to do so.<\/p><p>  It is fair to state our primary market in both savings and loans is the personal market.  However, SMEs can be members of credit unions and, as a consequence, borrow from their local credit union.  This applies, irrespective of whether the SME is a small sole trader or a more complex organisation such as company.  Credit unions have always lent into this sector to some extent.  However, we estimate that no more than approximately 5% of our total loan book is with the SME sector.  Given our community and local focus, that is a very low figure.<\/p><p>  In general, it is important to note that credit union loans represent excellent value, both for personal and business borrowers.  The average rate of interest is just over 10%.  That interest rate incorporates all charges.  We do not have interest penalties and the like.  Therefore, the product is good value.<\/p><p>  I will outline some of the roadblocks and try to explain why we are not more involved in lending to SMEs.  It is partly attributable to inertia in the sense that, traditionally, the private or personal market has been our primary one.  If a business person or his or her financial adviser is thinking about a loan, the credit union is probably not his or her first choice or the first organisation that comes into his or her head.  Every credit union is an independent legal entity, free to make its own business decisions, subject to law and regulation.  A result of this is that credit unions are free to decide, as a matter of policy, whether they want to get involved in commercial or business lending.  Many have decided not to do so, perhaps because they have identified that they do not necessarily have the skills to assess business loans.  They may consider the risks are too great, or that the cost of acquiring the necessary skills is too high.  These are some of the reasons we are not very much involved in the market.<\/p><p>  In addition to internal roadblocks, there are some external ones.  Loans to SMEs are riskier by their nature.  As a result of the financial crisis, credit unions have a low appetite for risk.  If they were to become more involved in the commercial lending sector, they would face additional scrutiny by the Central Bank.  Some may have decided they do not want this.  These are some of the reasons we are not very much involved in lending to SMEs.<\/p><p>  Another major roadblock is that over half of credit unions have some form of lending restriction from the Central Bank.  Most of these restrictions include some kind of prohibition on commercial lending.  In this context, commercial lending can include personal loans to self-employed persons, in addition to business and community-type loans.  Even where there is no restriction on commercial lending, most credit unions have a monetary restriction.  That limit would preclude any meaningful lending to SMEs, particularly when personal loans to the borrower must be factored in as part of these limits.<\/p><p>  Having spoken about the roadblocks, we would like to mention a couple of possible solutions or ways of overcoming them.  Credit unions could use the expertise in county enterprise boards around the country.  A small number of credit unions have done so to a limited extent.  In a nutshell, the credit union performs a preliminary review of a business loan application.  If it believes the application is a runner, it refers it to the local county enterprise board which can provide direct support, be it through a financial adviser or otherwise, and assist in preparing business plans or making financial projections.  If necessary, it can provide ongoing mentoring for the SME to help it to develop.  The decision on whether to grant a loan is a joint one between the credit union and the county enterprise board.<\/p><p>  This system has worked in Kilkenny in recent years as part of an arrangement between St. Canice's Kilkenny Credit Union and Kilkenny County Enterprise Board.  In this case, the credit union set aside a fund of &euro;2 million for loans.  It considers applications for loans of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;40,000.  To date, over 55 applications have been approved, totalling just under &euro;1.2 million.  This represents an average loan of approximately &euro;21,000 or &euro;22,000.  Around two thirds of these loans are approved, which is a relatively high rate of approval.  We estimate that there are approximately 129 jobs associated with the projects.  The outstanding amount on these loans is approximately &euro;439,000, which is small in the national scheme of things, but it could be a lot bigger if the arrangement was extended to other credit unions.  From anecdotal evidence, the vast majority of loans perform well.  The scheme could be extended to many other credit unions, particularly if there was some form of guarantee available to reduce the risk to them.<\/p><p>  The second suggestion is to allow credit unions to invest in a fund that could be lent to SMEs.  The idea is that credit unions would invest a limited ring-fenced amount of money, probably related to their reserves, that would be managed centrally by an appropriate body with the skills to lend to SMEs and manage business loans on an ongoing basis.  This kind of system would help to get over the variability of services or skills within credit unions and, to some extent, help to get over the lending restrictions.<\/p> <p>It would allow all SMEs in all parts of the country to benefit even where local credit unions were unable to lend directly.  While such a scheme would require Central Bank approval, it would be a very popular option for credit unions, particularly if there was some level of guarantee to reduce their risk.<\/p><p> We are in the business of lending, which is our primary source of income.  We want to lend and have the money to do so.  SMEs need funds and they have a vital role to play in underpinning prosperity locally and nationally.  Credit unions can be part of a solution.  We would welcome continued engagement with relevant Departments in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401959400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We will take questions after the presentations have concluded.

I am CEO of the Credit Union Development Association, or CUDA.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Elaine Larke, who is our head of legal and compliance.  CUDA is the only legally incorporated representative association for credit unions in the Republic of Ireland.  Current membership comprises 25 credit unions serving a combined membership of over 400,000 members, with a combined asset base of approximately &euro;2 billion.<br\/>The most appropriate way to start is to share thoughts on how SME or commercial lending occurs in the context of credit unions.  Section 6(2)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Credit Union Act requires credit unions to create sources of credit for the mutual benefit of their members at a fair and reasonable rate of interest.  Some credit unions inform us that in meeting this legislative requirement their lending policy includes personal loans to individuals to enhance and support their business objectives.  For example, a loan may be given to a local farmer to purchase farm machinery or to a taxi driver to upgrade his or her car.  Lending to sole traders and micro-businesses is more prevalent than the committee may be aware, as it is not necessarily recognised or acknowledged as SME lending due to its personal-lending basis.  Before describing three examples of the ways in which credit unions currently provide support to the SME sector, I emphasise that this is not a core business for credit unions.  In fact, it accounts for only a small percentage of the loan books of those credit unions that provide such loans.  It is not intended that it will become a core business.<br\/>The first of the three example formats is the traditional personal loan to a member of a credit union which he or she uses to invest in, or replenish, an asset.  The committee will be accustomed to this type of credit union finance where standard interest rates apply and the loan term normally matches the lifespan of the asset being purchased.  The second format is a scheme presented in conjunction with a local enterprise board.  The committee may not be as familiar with this practice.  This is where a credit union or group of credit unions develops a fund to lend from, which may vary subject to demand.  The scheme will normally have a minimum loan amount in the region of &euro;5,000, while the maximum amount tends to vary from &euro;25,000 to &euro;40,000.  In many cases, the interest rate will be less than the standard rate applicable in the credit union.  These loans are for working capital as well as for capital assets.  It is important to note that the loan contract is with the individual, not the company.  These are therefore personal loans.  All applicants undergo an initial screening process by either the credit union or the enterprise board.  Applicants who proceed to a full application will, in the first instance, be assessed from a personal credit perspective by the credit union, which will then refer the application back to the enterprise board for review and evaluation.  The credit union retains ultimate authority to approve the loan.  Unfortunately, these schemes have not flourished either because the Registry of Credit Unions has deemed them to be inappropriate for credit unions or restrictions have rendered it impossible for them to continue.  We will return to this point later.<br\/>The third and final example is where a credit union provides premises on favourable terms for start-up businesses.  For example, a credit union purchased a site and built an enterprise centre.  A separate company was established to govern the centre, which consists of a variety of different-sized units.  The board of directors for this company has seven directors - four from the credit union and one each from the local authority, Enterprise Ireland and the local community.  The purpose of the units are to provide start-up companies with a base to operate from while enjoying a favourable rental arrangement.  Start-ups benefit from a package of professional business mentoring and Enterprise Ireland supports to improve their chances of success.  The building remains as a working asset of the credit union.  Over the years, the occupancy has remained high while rental payments have performed exceptionally well.  CUDA is very supportive of trying to grow and develop these initiatives.<br\/>There are a number of challenging factors which currently curtail or prevent SME lending by the credit union, including the quality of SME lending applications.  Some credit unions have had negative experiences in the area of small business lending - especially with start-up enterprises - which has forced some to deem this type of lending to be too risky.  We are informed by experienced credit unions that many of the SME borrowing applications received are unrealistic having regard to current economic conditions and underlying levels of demand.  When consulting with our members in preparation for this meeting, one credit union with a long history of supporting small start-up enterprises stated:<blockquote>There are examples of existing businesses that have not faced up to the impact of falling demand for their business and which seek to augment reduced retained earnings with increased borrowings.<\/blockquote>In many cases, mainstream banks have already declined an identical application before it is presented to a credit union.  Despite the economic downturn, or perhaps driven by its impact on employment and income levels, there remains a steady in-flow of members seeking to set up new enterprises, particularly in the service and retail areas.  We are informed that many applications display a total absence of market research, no understanding of basic business practices and no awareness of current market conditions.  Unfortunately, we are told, most of these applications reflect an expectation that optimism will triumph over reality.  It would be of interest to the committee to know whether other entities such as Microfinance Ireland, which allocates funding from the microenterprise loan fund, are experiencing the same level of inconsistency and lack of preparation from businesses applying to them for funding.  Indeed, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation may also have experienced this weakness through its suite of financial schemes to assist businesses of a range of sizes across all industry sectors.<br\/>A second challenge is the perception that credit unions are not equipped or appropriate to undertake commercial lending.  There is certainly a perception at Government level, perhaps informed by our regulators, that credit unions are not equipped for commercial lending.  Various legislative provisions were enacted during 2012 which fuelled the perception that no credit union was suitable to lend to the SME sector.  An impact assessment conducted prior to the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 reported that credit union lending to business start-ups is only sanctioned on an exceptional basis and that such lending was not generally appropriate for the credit union sector overall.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation excluded credit unions from benefiting from the State guarantee scheme under the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 when providing business lending.  This occurred despite CUDA alerting the Department to the exclusion and requesting the designation of credit unions as participating lenders where they could meet the terms and conditions set down by the Minister as applicable to mainstream banks.<br\/>In view of the findings of the Commission on Credit Unions and the move towards tiered structuring of credit unions, such perceptions and State-imposed obstacles act as a further hindrance that credit unions must overcome in order to lend to small and medium enterprises.  Perhaps the perception can also be found within local communities that when it comes to commercial lending, credit unions are not open for business.  That is a reflection of the lack of promotion of the service by credit unions themselves.  It is something to look at.<br\/>The third challenge we have identified involves regulatory barriers to expanding credit union services.  The seeds of change within credit unions are well and truly sown.  A defining characteristic of this trend is the greater emphasis placed on being an efficient provider of a broad range of financial services.  The Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 requires every credit union to have in place a risk management officer, a compliance officer and an internal audit function.  To be sustainable, some credit unions will choose to move to the next stage of development and offer a wider range of services, including business lending.<\/p> <p>The Act allows credit unions to provide a broader range of services, and different classes of lending.  Providing new services, or simply enhancing existing offerings, will assist credit unions in attracting members who wish to borrow and thereby support the survival of the credit union while also helping SMEs.<\/p><p> As part of this process, it is critical that the Registry of Credit Unions puts in place a transparent and clear set of rules and standards for credit unions.  Transparency must be an inherent part of the tiered regulatory framework.  It is important that credit unions have sufficient guidance and information to enable them to be compliant and to take immediate corrective steps should they experience any deviation.  Clarity will help mitigate any concerns about possible subjective behaviour in the past where regulators have been accused of erecting artificial and unnecessary barriers to operating.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that during recent D&aacute;il debates, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, noted that &ldquo;about a dozen individual credit unions have lending restrictions that limit the amount loaned to less than &euro;10,000&rdquo;.  The information was based on information supplied to him by the Central Bank.  He then added that as the average loan of many of the credit unions is &euro;6,000, credit unions can continue to make loans significantly greater than the average loan for the sector.  In the event that the Central Bank is providing this analysis, it is extremely unfortunate that the opportunity was not taken to also explain the impact being experienced from the extension of such restrictions to encompass connected persons.  We are informed that this is the aspect that is having most impact on credit unions that have such restrictions placed on them.  In that instance, loans are limited to &euro;10,000, or even &euro;25,000 across a section of connected credit unions members.  Also, it is not unusual for a credit union with a lending restriction to include a blanket ban on commercial lending, which is defined as a loan for the purpose of generating income that will be utilised to repay the loan, thereby ruling out all SME-related lending.<\/p><p> In the current climate, the greatest fear relating to any expansion or involvement in SME lending is the actual or perceived risk associated with such lending, coupled with uncertainties in the likely approaches or regulatory restrictions adopted by the regulator that would limit a credit union&rsquo;s entrance or continuance in this sector.  In terms of the way forward, credit unions could facilitate SME financial education.  Many credit unions would be willing to work with the many interested stakeholders involved in the SME sector, in particular those focused on the small businesses and microbusinesses, to facilitate education events that ensure entrepreneurs can construct an appropriate strategic plan.<\/p><p> The second is to develop the required expertise in credit unions.  A recurring theme from our member credit unions is the need to develop new areas of investment and revenue stream.  Some have a greater risk appetite for SME lending than others and this is related to the varying degree of expertise and commercial underwriting skills and experience within the credit union.  However, SME lending is not, and will not be, the core business of a credit union and for the vast majority it would take time to develop resources to perform underwriting and the necessary asset and liability management functions.  To a large extent that would involve training and-or employing the necessary skills required.<\/p><p> The Commission on Credit Unions emphasised that there is scope for better and closer co-operation and co-ordination among credit unions towards shared services and standardisation of processes.  Credit unions that do not have the necessary skills or manpower could benefit from obtaining back office support from those credit unions that have developed the required underwriting expertise for business lending, while boards of directors ensure they can comply with the rules governing outsourcing of services.<\/p><p> The third is to reduce the risks and to consider providing funding as an investment.  A more attractive and immediate way forward for credit unions, especially where the relevant expertise is not present, is that such lending forms part of their investment portfolio and the capital is provided through a central or local government agency, such as the local enterprise board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401960000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>We are running short of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500005#E00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401960000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Going back as far as 2009 we set out a paper on how such an investment bond could be utilised.

I am the CEO of Naas Credit Union.  I am also a director of education and training for the Credit Union Managers' Association, CUMA.  I am accompanied by Mr. Gerry McConville, CEO of Dundrum Credit Union and a member of the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association.  CUMA thanks the committee for the invitation.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss SME lending, the important role the SME sector plays in the country and how credit unions can lend to the sector.<\/p><p>  CUMA is the professional organisation for credit union managers in Ireland and it has 250 members.  Our aim is to support credit union managers in their role and to offer best practice guidance, training and, where appropriate, representation on issues that affect them.  We believe in and are passionate about a strong well-run credit union sector in Ireland.  Credit unions are personal lenders and we exist in communities to provide a safe place for the community to save and to provide access to credit for those communities.  Today, credit unions are modernising and providing more essential services and that development will continue.  There is massive strength in credit unions in Ireland.  Membership is significant with more than 3 million members on the island.  While not without challenges, credit unions have operated successfully in recent years.<\/p><p>  A number of strategic challenges face credit unions that we believe are relevant to the committee today.  First, there is a lack of demand for credit in the economy, which resulted in credit union loan books falling.  There is also a changed regulatory landscape which means we need to operate differently in the future environment.  There is an urgent need for credit unions to grow our loan books in a sustainable and quality way.  The SME sector is a very important one for credit unions.  We already provide significant lending to the sector.  Significant numbers of our members are employed by the SME sector and the income they receive from their jobs help them to pay their loans and support strong and vibrant credit unions.  We believe that having a strong and vibrant SME sector will enhance all the credit unions in Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is an opportunity for credit unions to lend to the sector.  We welcome that fact.  Lending to the sector is almost a natural extension of the credit unions' existing market.  Already, we provide significant loans to SME owners and business owners for their personal financial needs.  In addition, credit unions also offer on a small scale, capital loans and even working capital loans for some businesses.  I meet many SME owners on a regular basis who tell me that without the credit unions they would not be in business today, and that the loans they got from their credit union have provided them with the necessary resources to start or to sustain their businesses.<\/p><p>  A number of credit unions have already entered the market in a structured way.  I can point to three examples later on which we can have further discussion.  SME lending by its very nature is much more risky and has a higher level of risk.  Credit unions, on the other hand are conservative and our job as managers in credit unions and directors of credit unions is to lend the members' savings.  Therefore, we must ensure that we lend those savings in a way that has real responsibility; that the loans are lent prudently and sustainably.  SME lending is not without challenges for credit unions.  The necessary and specialist skillset is required to consider business plans and projections.  Understanding of the sector and the specific business opportunity of the SME is vital.  It is fair to say that those skills exist in a limited way in credit unions today, but there are also distinct advantages of the credit union model.<\/p><p>  I ask myself what makes one SME more successful than another.  Perhaps it is the idea, the plan, the opportunity or perhaps it is luck but quite often it comes down to the willingness of the SME owner to make it work.  Credit unions' independence and local nature are our greatest strengths in that respect and they allow us to understand our community, the people to whom we lend and the business to which we lend.  Local knowledge of the borrowers is a very important aspect of the loans and while a centralised underwriting model might limit discretion in some cases, credit unions can make quality lending decisions with the right resources.<\/p> <p>While a centralised underwriting model may limit discretion in some cases, credit unions can make good lending decisions with the right resources.  This type of lending is high-risk and not all credit unions will engage in it.  Credit unions need to invest in the expertise, systems and processes required to lend to this market.  The experience thus far of a number of credit unions which have entered the space of SME lending has been mixed.<\/p><p> Credit unions in Dundrum and Kilkenny engaged with their local enterprise boards to provide loans to SME owners.  In Waterford a similar model was developed, with three of the city's credit unions partnering with the enterprise board to offer funds to the SME market.  These initiatives were successful in their own way but they were not sustained in some cases.  The challenge of providing the expertise and resources to properly underwrite loans, which is linked to ensuring that decision makers on businesses and loans were also the people who were lending the money, meant that the models were not sustainable.  However, a key feature of the models was the aftercare and support provided through partnerships between the enterprise boards, the credit unions and SME owners.<\/p><p> CUMA would like to present three options for the committee to consider in regard to supporting the goal of providing credit to the SME sector.  Consideration should be given to extending a partial guarantee for enterprise-based lending to individual credit unions.  Where credit unions have already established partnerships with local enterprise offices, they can leverage the great work done by these offices.  This model would achieve the goal of lending to the SME sector, and acceptance of the guarantee could be accompanied by opening up a percentage of credit union loan books for this type of lending.  This would require the credit unions concerned to develop the skills and resources and to invest in them on an ongoing basis.  Local links between credit unions and local enterprise boards would facilitate the acquisition of these skills and the guarantee would help to mitigate the risk appetite for individual credit unions.<\/p><p> Engagement with local enterprise boards has been a very positive experience for a number of credit unions.  However, it is not a complete solution.  Enterprise boards are excellent at encouraging enterprise but by their nature they involve risk-taking activities.  The final decision on whether to grant a loan application is based on the risk presenting to the credit union.  Given the existing lack of resources available to credit unions, it may not be easy for them to acquire such resources in the future.  This creates a significant barrier to the expansion of lending activities to enterprise.<\/p><p> Consideration could also be given to the development of a co-operative organisation with the resources, systems and skills necessary to consider and underwrite SME lending.  This model would see a central company taking referrals from individual credit unions on SME lending opportunities.  The central company could complete the assessment in line with agreed criteria, including the local knowledge of the credit union.  The co-operative would take a portion of the risk on the loan but could also access the State guarantee and State support for funding.  Resources and skills would thereby be centralised and available for all credit unions to access, and individual credit unions could refer their members to the co-operative.  This model would need to link with local enterprise organisations to ensure that it properly supports the market.  A final benefit of the model is that it would protect credit unions by spreading risk across the sector and allow them to take a diversified view of lending opportunities.<\/p><p> The third and final option is more widely applicable and would involve the Government raising an enterprise bond from credit unions to be used by a State-backed organisation that could lend onwards to SMEs.  Credit unions would not be directly involved in credit assessment and underwriting but could refer SME owners to an enterprise bank.  This would have the most immediate and countrywide application, because credit unions currently have significant excess liquidity.  Every credit union could invest in the bond, allowing the State to leverage credit union capital and enabling lending to the sector.<\/p><p> The development of any lending support to the SME sector would require an engagement with the Central Bank in order to obtain approval for the model.  The support of the partial guarantee, along with credit unions' demonstrating the necessary skills and resources to manage the risks of such lending, are key to achieving that approval.  It should be noted that successful models exist in more developed credit union systems.  In the US and Canada, for example, credit unions are significant lenders to the SME sector, and there is no reason this cannot be developed in Ireland.  CUMA welcomes this initial dialogue and would encourage ongoing communication with all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401960600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their informative presentations.

A question that arose in regard to all of the witnesses' presentations, and which Mr. Murray addressed to some degree, pertains to the expertise required in credit unions to decide on these loans.  I understand there will always be applications from, for example, taxi drivers who need to replace their cars.  That is a concrete example, but we have learned that the banks still lack the relevant skills to deal with this area.  I acknowledge, however, that they have committed to upskilling their staff to deal with new business types that are becoming the norm.  These new business types are currently unfamiliar to them and it is difficult to assess a business concept if one lacks expertise in the relevant areas.  If a 22 year old individual presented with a plan for the next Google, how do the witnesses propose to deal with him or her?  I accept the point that the local enterprise offices can help, but witnesses in previous sessions have questioned whether the local enterprise offices possess the requisite skills.  I do not expect the witnesses to have the answer today because it is an issue that has yet to be addressed.  Even the banks have not upskilled their staff adequately, and a solution still needs to be found.

It also comes down to the level or risk and the level of finance required.  Where one is looking at significant amounts to invest in a business, again one has to look at what is appropriate.  As I understood the brief coming in this morning, it was to talk about the smaller level of lending that credit unions do and are familiar with.<\/p><p> One of the unique features of credit unions is that fact that we are local and our knowledge of the people to whom we are lending.  While it is important to understand the business and the sector, it is equally important to understand the person one is lending to, his or her character and whether he or she can make it a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401961200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will come back to Deputy Lyons on country enterprise boards, CEBs, which are being subsumed into LEOs, and how they can contribute, as well as the partnerships we have referred to in a number of examples such as Kilkenny and Dundrum where credit unions and CEBs have come together.  Such a board provides two broad types of support to make that work.  One is the underwriting of the credit assessment.  The boards, more so than the credit unions, are best placed to have knowledge.  They have evaluated grant applications to support business for years and, therefore, they have the technical expertise to plug in.  More important, they have a range of supports for the 19 year old with the next Google when he approaches them and that includes, for example, mentoring panels in some cases.

However, such proposals add to the general government deficit, whereas the Government wants initiatives to be off-balance-sheet.<\/p><p>  I would like to address a number of questions to Mr. Murray.  The collapse in confidence in the banks over the past number of years has given a stimulus to credit unions.  Can this be maintained?  Many credit unions are independent.  Does there need to be greater co-operation between them in order that they can grow, meaning individual credit unions would have to have confidence in their neighbouring credit unions in terms of regulation, management, corporate governance and so on?<\/p><p>  Mr. Matthews mentioned St. Canice's Credit Union initiative with the CEB in Kilkenny.  Was that pilot scheme initiated by the credit union or the ILCU?<\/p><p>  Mr. Murray mentioned that rural credit unions know their customers and their character and creditworthiness.  Does he think, therefore, that if they began to lend to SMEs, they would be taking on clients refused by the banks?  On the one hand, the risk would be increased, but on the other, the credit union would know the people who are applying.<\/p><p>  CUDA is much more reluctant to get involved in this area than the ILCU.

In terms of stimulus, it is a fantastic opportunity for credit unions.  Enormous trust has been built between members and their credit unions over the past number of years.  By being co-operative in nature and by always making the right decision, credit unions ensure that trust is maintained.  There is an incredible opportunity for credit unions now, and in time, with the right structures in place, I see no reason they could not be the first choice.  It is the ambition of many credit unions to be the first choice in the community for personal finance.  Given time, with a strong offering in the SME sector, there is also no reason they could not be the first choice in that respect.<\/p><p>  There is always room for additional and much more coherent co-operation between credit unions to mitigate risk.  Co-operation does not increase risk; in many ways it can reduce it.  Model 2, which I presented earlier, is about co-operation.  Credit unions co-operate together with a central body which has the necessary skills, experience and expertise at a much greater level than can be achieved in individual credit unions, and by enabling such a body to come together, that would allow credit unions to access that market and potentially be the number one in that space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500007#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401961200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>The St. Canice's Credit Union scheme was a local initiative and it was not part of a pilot.

Credit union funds are not earning anywhere near as much as we would like, so this is a very productive use of the funds.  It would be more than just a fund.  Other witnesses have referred to the lack of awareness of many of the Government-supported schemes.  That is certainly a role which we think credit unions could play as well.  Without adding any risk to their own balance, they could certainly contribute meaningfully to a community.

What has gone on in the Naas Credit Union, particularly during the past two or three years, has been nothing but outstanding.  I have attended a number of AGMs and I am delighted to see him here today.  I have a couple of questions.  What happened during the banking crisis, and to a certain extent the credit union crisis, was the close linkages made between boards, management and the people who were borrowing money.  People who received money should never have done so.  A lot of the boards are made up of local people.  Do we need to make stronger regulations in regard to the role of boards in credit unions?<\/p><p>  I love the idea that the credit unions are linking in with the LEOs and using their expertise.  LEOs have a limited fund; that is the problem with a lot of them.  A lot of good ideas come from entrepreneurs who go to LEOs.  Instead of five or six credit unions all coming to use the expertise of LEOs, could it perhaps be done on a county basis, so that LEOs could direct their services to particular credit unions? <\/p><p>  Could the Government guarantee be a more partial guarantee, rather than a full guarantee, so that some risk was being taken by the credit union as well?  That might make it more likely that whoever one was lending money to would repay it.  <\/p><p>  Another matter to have been alluded to, and it probably came up in the situation which arose in my area, was amalgamation of credit unions.  This is more to do with what John was talking about earlier, namely, expertise.  It is not possible for each credit union to have all the expertise.  Perhaps the credit union movement could work together to create another level, whether on a county or a regional basis, where the expertise could be pooled.  For example, if someone were to come to a manager such as Sean with a good-quality idea, he might not have the expertise to assess it properly, but there might be another level up.  It might not be the LEOs that had the expertise, but it would be at the next level up.  I know that people might say that it was becoming more like a bank.  What has happened in the banks is that the local level does not have the same influence in the decision-making process, but here the local credit union could have a stronger influence but also get expertise from a level above that, rather than each credit union having to go out and source their own expertise. <\/p><p>  Some of the ideas being put forward are excellent.  The question is how we progress them further.  I hate seeing people coming to this committee and it becoming more of a talking shop than something that facilitates.  I believe that the credit unions have some &euro;8 billion available.  That is a huge sum of money.  Witnesses have quite rightly talked today of the ECB reducing deposit rates below 0% on overnight borrowing.  Some of them have become involved in Davy's.  That is highly risky.  If it can be managed properly, there is potential for credit unions to lend to viable - that is the key word - or potentially viable SMEs, but I say again that the expertise needs to be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500008#H00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401961800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I should state first that I certainly do not think that credit unions need stronger regulations.

In areas such as risk management, compliance and internal audit functions, there are direct reporting lines to boards.  A greater onus of responsibility is placed on boards.  Terms are being applied and there are exclusions as to who can serve on boards.  There is therefore a set of rules around the governance of credit unions that goes well beyond what one will find in other financial institutions.  That has been very well addressed.  Credit unions are also subject to regular inspections by the Central Bank.  They are called \"prison inspections\".

In some instances credit unions fund working capital, but in our experience in Naas it is more for equipment for the small and medium enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401963000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Credit unions basically engage in asset finance.

By way of introduction, I will tell the committee about Dublin BIC.  It is part of a national and European organisation of business and innovation centres that identify, select and support entrepreneurial start-ups.  We assist in the creation and development of enterprise and innovation in the Dublin region by providing practical support and assistance to entrepreneurs and start-up enterprises with the potential for strong growth.  We work in close partnership with Enterprise Ireland, in particular, to support its high potential start-up companies, including the EnterpriseSTART 2 programme.<\/p> <p> The Dublin Business Innovation Centre was established in 1988 and was one of the first ever public private partnerships formed in Ireland to assist SME development.  It has strongly supported the economic growth and performance in the Dublin region over the past two and a half decades.<\/p><p> We are a member of the association of business and innovation centres in Ireland along with West BIC, South East BIC and Cork BIC.  All of which provide key enterprise support and services to entrepreneurs nationally.  As the BICs enterprise support is nationwide, it provides a deep regional reach for new sets of entrepreneurs and provides a valuable network for identifying investor-ready seed and early stage start-ups.<\/p><p> We are proud of our strategic role as the initiator of new funding and support models to stimulate and nurture the development of new SMEs in Ireland.  These included the groundbreaking initiative that led to the launch of the first seed fund for SMEs in Ireland in 1991, which was done in partnership with private, banking, EU and public funded support.<\/p><p> We also initiated the setting up of the first private investor forum for investing in start-ups in 2006 called the Halo Business Angel Partnership in Ireland.  That was done in partnership with InterTradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland.  This promotion of private angel investing has resulted in a significant growth in the number of angel investors and funding for SMEs.<\/p><p> The BICs act selectively and effectively become a partner to accompany and hand hold the entrepreneur through all the stages of the development of his or her business.  Dublin BIC's companies are knowledge-based, export-oriented and high-potential companies with a requirement for early stage hands-on support and advice over the critical first three to five years of their development.  <\/p><p> Dublin BIC works with high potential entrepreneurs at seed, start-up and growth stages.  We differ from most forms of enterprise support in that we project manage the entrepreneur through each stage of the SME start-up process, basically from seed to market growth stage.  Our activities complement the assistance and services provided by the State agencies and the private sector.<\/p><p> We are run by a professional, multidisciplinary team with extensive experience in start-up and developing SMEs.  We have specialist technology sectoral expertise and international marketing and fund management expertise.  Dublin BIC is supported by a board of directors comprised of some of the most respected senior executives in Irish business.  We are a full member of the Irish and European venture capital associations, IVCA and the EVCA, and we are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> I shall outline the range of integrated financial services that we provide.  For example, we provide access to seed and start-up venture capital through the &euro;53 million AIB seed capital fund which is co-managed by Dublin BIC.  We also provide access to business angel investment through the Halo Business Angel Partnership.  That, too, is managed by Dublin BIC and has national partners throughout the country, including West BIC, South BIC, South East BIC and Cork BIC.  Finally, we manage incubation-enterprise space which is located at the Guinness Enterprise Centre based in Dublin.  The facilities provide enterprise space for start-ups and early stage companies.<\/p><p> I shall now drill into each of those elements and shall begin with investor-ready business planning support and mentoring.  We work alongside the entrepreneurs through project evaluation and the various start-up stages and continue to assist the business through the first three to five years.  Through our client assistance programme, we provide intensive investor-ready business planning support in order to hopefully graduate them to the high potential start-up stage.  Dublin BIC has assisted in creating over 500 new businesses and employs approximately 4,460 people, including over 2,428 directly.<\/p><p> The annual turnover of supported start-up companies was &euro;172 million in 2012.  The economic impact of assisted start-ups in 2012 was &euro;229 million which is based on independent research by DKM Economic Consultants.<\/p><p> Over the past 25 years, Dublin BIC has provided guidance to over 12,000 inquiries; provided business plan assistance to over 4,000 entrepreneurs; nurtured from conceptual-stage to 500 start-up enterprises while completing 780 business plans and encouraging entrepreneurs to achieve progress in building their enterprises; and supported 135 business expansions.  Independent evaluations have established that 80% of Dublin BIC-assisted projects survive through their first critical five years.<\/p><p> With regard to access to start-up investment for SMEs, we have seen that innovative and high growth potential companies at the start-up stage are typically funded by equity investment, rather than loan finance.  Basically, that is due to the high risk profile.  They are often pre-revenue and conducting the product development and planning market launch.  That means that they are at the very early stage.  To address the funding gap at the seed and start-up stage Dublin BIC took strategic initiatives to provide access to both seed capital funding and angel investors nationally.<\/p><p> Ireland has seen an increase in recent years, since 2007, in seed fund investment activity.  A total of &euro;134 million has been made available to back entrepreneurs at the seed and start-up stages.  The &euro;53 million AIB seed fund is a limited partnership between AIB Bank and Enterprise Ireland.  The fund is the most active seed and start-up fund in the Irish market since its launch in 2007.  Dublin BIC and Enterprise Equity, the investment partners, are co-fund managers of this Fund.  Dublin BIC's mandate is to invest in the Dublin region while Enterprise Equity invests mainly in the regions nationally.  To date, the fund overall has invested &euro;28 million in 75 innovative export-led SME companies, including follow-on investments.  This is expected to increase before the primary investing period for new first round investments concludes at the end of 2014.<\/p><p> As a lead cornerstone investor in many co-investment investment rounds, the investee companies have succeeded in leveraging in investment rounds of almost &euro;100 million.  Co-investors in these rounds would  typically comprise angel investors, other private investors, Irish and international venture capital funds, and Enterprise Ireland.  Currently, these companies collectively employ 720 people directly and a corresponding number of support jobs.<\/p><p> Dublin BIC has made 54 investments to date in 38 start-up companies in Dublin.  This number is expected to increase before the primary investing period ceases at the end of 2014.<\/p><p> I shall now refer to the Halo Business Angel Partnership.  Dublin BIC initiated the setting up of the first business angel partnership in Ireland in 2006 in partnership with InterTradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland.  Since then the Irish market has seen a sizeable growth in angel numbers and funding for start-up and early stage enterprises.<\/p><p> The Halo Business Angel Partnership, or HBAP as it is better know, is managed by Dublin BIC.  We match angel investors with pre-screened investment opportunities at start-up and early stages.  HBAP is a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the Irish Business and Innovation Centres.  HBAP has offices in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway and provides a nationwide business matching service to select companies.  HBAP works in partnership with HBAN which is the national federation of business angel networks in Ireland.<\/p><p> Our role is to act as facilitators for both angel investors and start-up companies seeking investment.  HBAP works to increase the number of angel investors investing in start-up and early stage companies and supports the formation of new and existing angel networks, both regionally and nationally. <\/p> <p>Companies and investors are pre-screened, initial meetings are arranged between investors and companies and we provide support throughout the fund raising process.  The average angel investment per deal to date has been around &euro;175,000.  To date, business angel investors have invested a total of &euro;26 million in early-stage companies that leveraged in investment rounds of &euro;65 million.<br\/>Dublin BIC provides important added value for the start-ups, apart from cash, including hands-on business planning and pre-investment mentoring.  In our role as seed fund manager, our extensive experience in managing the investment process, including access to angel and private co-investors, contributes to an efficient and successful fund raising experience for companies. We believe strongly in providing high quality and significant after care resources to support the companies post-investment.  That is a critical piece of the jigsaw because the challenge is to help companies to get early traction in the marketplace.  In addition to investment, we provide support through attendance at board meetings and other strategic sessions.  Assuming companies progress with their business, they will move on to a &quot;Series A&quot; investment round with later-stage VCs.  That is delivering added value for entrepreneurs.  We also believe we deliver added value for the co-investors.<br\/>The Dublin BIC investment strategy, from the beginning, has been to promote and  cultivate a co-investment approach for start-ups, leveraging our established network of contacts and referrals from other parties.<b><i><\/i><\/b>This means that we get good co-investment coverage in terms of the round and the kind of expertise and skills that come to the table from various investors, apart from ourselves.  We have successfully worked with many within our network, including the AIB seed capital fund, Halo Business Angel Partnership, HBAP and other private investors and seed funds to participate in investment rounds with us.  Our approach has produced key benefits for these investors including giving them the opportunity to co-invest in a larger round, spreading the investor risk and expediting their investment decisions by dovetailing with our own seed fund term sheet, for example.  Furthermore, our deal structure and due diligence helps to speed up the whole investment process.<br\/>The Dublin BIC seed fund team would typically project-manage the investment process from beginning to completion, including drawing up legal share subscription agreements and so forth.  This benefits the angel and private investors by reducing the amount of time they have to spend on investment completion.  Both seed fund and angel or private investors invest on the same commercial terms and share the same upside and downside risks.<br\/>The other key deliverable of Dublin BIC is the Guinness Enterprise Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500010#K01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Hobbs","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401964200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Hobbs to summarise the remainder of his contribution because several members have business to attend to in the D&aacute;il Chamber soon but would like to ask questions before they leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500012#M00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401964200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am happy to do that.<\/p><p>  The Guinness Enterprise Centre is providing key incubation space in Dublin.  <\/p><p>  In summary, Dublin BIC is a strong advocate for seed and start-up funding within the Irish market.

In fact, I will use the example of our very first investment from the seed fund in 2008 in a very innovative company called Clevamama, based in Coolock in North Dublin and headed up by two sisters.  It got support initially from the Dublin City Enterprise Board.  As those involved moved through the initial steps of developing their company, they moved up the line and came to Dublin BIC.  We gave them additional mentoring to bring them through the investor-ready process for a sizeable seed investment round.  We did that seed investment round with some private investor angel investment back in 2008 and the company has made great progress since then.  It has weathered the recession and expanded sales.  Last year it increased sales by 50% and is now in international markets, including Europe, Brazil and the United States.  In 2012 we helped the company to move to second-round investment.  We helped to bring in further added-value private investors who have significant PLC experience in the Irish market.  This illustrates our strategy of bringing in not just cash but significant added-value to help companies in their business development.  That is just one example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014060500012#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Hobbs"},{"type":"speech","time":1401964200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hobbs for that.

This will be the final Environment Council of the Greek Presidency and it takes place in advance of major changes in the EU institutions in the coming months.  In fact, those changes have already commenced with the recent elections to the European Parliament, the eighth Parliament to be directly elected.  In the coming weeks, key positions in the Parliament will be filled, positioning MEPs to play a key role in the co-decision procedure which underpins the development of EU legislation and policies.<br \/>There are two substantive legislative items for discussion on the agenda next week.  The first is an orientation debate on a proposal from the European Commission for directives on a clean air policy package for Europe.  The second items is a first reading of a regulation providing for a restriction on or prohibition of the cultivation of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in member states' territories.<br \/>Clean air is an issue I feel very strongly about and to which I have devoted much time and effort in recent years.  We have had some notable success in Ireland addressing very severe air pollution problems, which resulted primarily from the widespread use of smoky coal in our cities during the 1980s and 1990s.  These emissions still occur, however, albeit at a lower level, and the science now indicates that air pollution, even at low levels, impacts on health.  The Environmental Protection Agency reports higher levels of such air pollutants in some of our smaller towns than in our larger cities, where smoky coal and other solid fuels continue to be used for home heating.<br \/>We cannot afford to be complacent.  Many EU member states are still falling short of agreed EU air quality standards.  Here in Ireland, the air pollution guidelines of the UN World Health Organization are not fully being met.  One need only recall the threats to human health posed by elevated air pollution events earlier this year in the United Kingdom and France to understand the risks for citizens.  Air pollution does not recognise borders and can affect regional neighbours.  The risks posed by transboundary air pollution can only be addressed through international co-operation.  In this context, under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, I initiated a cross-Border study to consider how best to address residential solid fuel emissions on an all-island basis.<br \/>The EU's clean air policy package, unveiled in December 2013, is the culmination of a major review of air policy that began in early 2011.  It follows extensive consultations that found broad support for EU-wide action in this area.  The content of the EU's proposal was considered by an air science policy forum which I hosted in Dublin during Ireland's EU Presidency last year.  The forum considered the most up-to-date scientific research on air pollution and human health and the environment, and this informed subsequent discussion by EU environment Ministers.  The package includes a proposal for a revised national emission ceilings directive, with stricter national emission ceilings for five main air pollutants, including fine particulate matter - a pollutant which strongly correlates with health impacts.  The proposed emission ceilings for 2020 are broadly in line with Ireland's own national projections, but proposed ceilings for 2025 and 2030 would require further action.  In the case of ammonia, from 2020 onward, further abatement measures will be required, beyond those already agreed for 2020.  This will present a challenge for the agriculture sector, which is responsible for the vast majority of these emissions and is projecting growth in line with ambitions under Food Harvest 2020.  My officials are in ongoing discussion with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this matter.<br \/>The package also includes a proposal for a new directive to reduce pollution from medium-sized combustion plants, with outputs of between 1 and 50 MW, such as energy plants for large buildings and small industrial installations.  The proposal also aims to take account of compliance costs, the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, and keeping the administrative burden at the lowest possible level while at the same time providing minimum levels of protection to safeguard human health and the environment.  By 2030, the clean air policy package aims to avoid 58,000 premature deaths.  Health benefits alone from the package could save society &euro;40 billion to &euro;140 billion in external costs and provide billions in direct benefits due to higher productivity of the workforce, lower health care costs, higher crop yields and less damage to buildings.  It is estimated to have a positive net impact on economic growth.<br \/>Ireland enjoys cleaner air than many of our European neighbours due to a variety of factors, including meteorological conditions, limited smokestack or heavy industry, and implementation of European as well as national clean air policy initiatives.  However, challenges remain to ensure our air quality is protected and enhanced into the future.  It is important that we look at clean air policy in the broader context, not just in isolation.  We must consider the wider benefits by taking account of impacts and synergies with other policy areas, such as health, climate, transport, economic productivity and so on, in framing new policies and approaches.  The Irish position will continue to support measures that have been demonstrated to be cost-effective, achievable and which support related policy briefs.<br \/>As regards GMOs, the Presidency is seeking political agreement on a proposed amendment to Directive 2001\/18\/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs.  The amendment, if progressed, will allow member states to restrict or prohibit the commercial cultivation of GMOs in their territory under defined criteria.  Since the Commission originally proposed this amendment to the deliberate release directive back in 2010, Ireland has been generally supportive of the concept of individual member states possessing greater powers in this area.  We previously expressed some reservations on the legal compatibility of the proposal with Internal Market rules and the rules of world trade agreements.  However, Ireland has adopted a more positive view on the file as the text has developed.  The draft submitted to Council has significant support across member states and I propose to vote in favour of it.  None of the GM crops currently authorised for commercial cultivation within the European Union is considered relevant to Irish agriculture.  In that sense, Ireland would not have an immediate need to consider implementing the provisions of the proposal.  Indeed, we can learn from the initial experiences of other member states.<br \/>Moving on to the non-legislative items on the agenda, the Council will discuss draft conclusions on the Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD, and will hold a policy debate on the 2030 framework for energy and climate.  While my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has lead responsibility for nature and biodiversity matters, Iwill represent Ireland at Council in the discussions on this topic.<br \/>The Council conclusions set out the EU position in preparation for a number of forthcoming meetings, namely, the 12th meeting of the conference of the parties to the CBD; the first meeting of the conference of the parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing; and the seventh meeting of the conference of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  Ireland can strongly support the overall aims and themes of the conclusions around the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services and the need to step up efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity.<br \/>The Council conclusions reflect and highlight some of the achievements of the EU, particularly in regard to the progress on the strategic plan for biodiversity.  Later this year, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, expects to publish a mid-term review of the implementation of Ireland's national biodiversity plan, which will highlight Ireland's contribution to both EU and international progress on the CBD objectives.<br \/>The conclusions also aim to re-emphasise the commitments made to ratify the Nagoya Protocol, with a view to having the first conference of the parties and meeting of the parties to the protocol.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is working with other Departments and agencies to determine the practical requirements to give effect to the Nagoya Protocol.  In that regard, ratification is likely to occur in 2015.<br \/>The Cartagena Protocol, the third element of the Council conclusions, seeks to protect biodiversity from potential risks arising from the transboundary movement of any living modified organisms, resulting from modern biotechnology that may have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.  There are 167 parties to the protocol, and all EU member states, including Ireland and the EU itself, are parties.  The protocol was adopted as a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity.  A programme of work associated with the Cartagena Protocol is discussed and approved by meetings of the parties which take place every two years.<br \/>Ireland supports the overall EU position outlined in the conclusions.  In particular, we welcome the call for parties to agree a realistic budget consistent with the agreed strategic priorities, functions and programme of work for the effective implementation of the Cartagena Protocol.  Adopting this more pragmatic approach should reduce the need for <i>ad hoc<\/i>requests for additional voluntary funding for inter-sessional activities as has occurred previously.<br \/>At its March meeting, the European Council agreed to have a stock-take of the proposed policy framework for climate and energy in the period to 2030 at its June meeting, with a view to the European Council taking a decision on the headline targets in October 2014.  It is in this context that the Environment Council will consider elements of the framework at its meeting on 12 June.  Responding to the recent communication from the Commission on a policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030, the European Council has stated that &quot;a coherent European energy and climate policy must ensure affordable energy prices, industrial competitiveness, security of supply and achievement of our climate and environmental objectives&quot;.  The emphasis on the need for coherence between greenhouse gas emission reductions, renewable energy and energy efficiency is central to a cost-effective policy framework and security and affordability of energy supply for households and business.<br \/>This initial direction from the European Council puts the cross-sectoral nature, scale and importance of the 2030 challenge in clear perspective.  Priority elements still to be agreed with a view to the EU decision in October 2014 include the question of EU headline targets, in particular the greenhouse gas emission reduction target and the proposed EU-wide renewable energy target, as well as the general principles accompanying the framework such as effort-sharing and the proposed governance structure.  Ireland has previously outlined its concerns regarding some elements of the framework proposal.  We are continuing our engagement with the Commission at all levels to clarify the possible implications for Ireland and ensure a fair and cost-effective solution is reached.  This work will continue and intensify in the coming weeks and months.<\/p> <p>While dealing with climate matters, let me also touch on an any other business item in regard to the Kyoto Protocol.  In December 2012, at the Doha climate change conference, the parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted the so-called Doha amendment which, <i>inter alia, <\/i>establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 to 2020, with legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments for specified parties, including the EU and its member states.  The formal entry into force of the Doha amendment is an important objective for the EU.  This requires 144 of the 192 parties to the Kyoto Protocol, including the EU and its member states, to deposit their instruments of ratification.  The proposal for a Council decision aims to achieve ratification on behalf of the EU.  The proposal remains under discussion within Council, with a view to adoption this year.<br \/>I should add that Ireland's emission reduction commitment in the second commitment period, like those of the EU's other member states, is the same as that under existing EU legislation so no additional commitment is being entered into as a result of ratification of the Doha amendment.  Ireland's ratification of the Doha amendment involves a formal Government decision and the passing of a resolution in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, preparations for which have commenced.<br \/>Turning briefly to national climate policy matters, on 23 April last, I released a national climate policy position and the general scheme of a climate action and low-carbon development Bill.  The national position provides a coherent, high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to pursue and achieve transition to a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  Complementing the national policy position, the general scheme of the climate action and low-carbon development Bill provides a statutory basis for this national transition objective, via the preparation of successive five-yearly national low-carbon roadmaps and successive national climate change adaptation frameworks.  I take this opportunity to thank the committee for its report on the outline heads of the Bill and I look forward to further engagement with it on the proposed provisions as the Bill progresses through the Oireachtas.<br \/><b><\/b>Coming back to next Thursday's Council agenda, over lunch we will have an informal discussion on the current state of play in regard to the outcome of the Rio+20 conference.  We are currently awaiting details from the Greek Presidency on the nature of these discussions so I am not in a position to elaborate further at this stage.<br \/>At the end of the day's business, the Council will consider a number of items under the any other business heading, including the current state of play on a proposed regulation on emissions from maritime transport and a proposal for a directive on plastic carrier bags.  Ministers will also receive information on a number of issues, including endocrine disrupters, highly fluorinated substances and the work programme of the incoming Italian Presidency.  Detailed debate is not expected on any of these items.<br \/>This is a brief run-through of the main items for next Thursday's Council agenda.  I will be happy to deal with any questions members may have.  My officials will be glad to take any technical questions or questions on the working groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500004#E00100","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401959700,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and his officials for attending.

This will form part of the sectoral plans which will come from each Department, arising from the enactment of our climate Bill this year.  Much work is going on in each of the relevant Departments, in particular in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport, Tourism and Sport, to ensure we meet our obligations.  There are many challenges on the renewable energy side.  Even though we have indicated our targets for 2020 as part of our objectives, we are aware there are many challenges in meeting those targets, not least 2020, but going forward what our level of ambition should be for 2030.  There are indicators from the modelling we are doing that renewable energy targets, because of the some of the controversies, will be more difficult to meet.

In that context, could we make a move towards the utilisation of liquid gas so as to displace dependency on petrol and diesel, which I understand would just require a simple modification to a vehicle?  However, I believe this would have to be policy driven.  I say this with the commercial benefits in mind.  Hopefully, we will see gas coming from the Corrib gas field and I know there is a plant in the south of the country looking for permission to produce liquid gas.  As a more immediate step towards reducing our transport emissions, we need to look at something like this.  We will not displace petrol, diesel or oil unless we have viable alternatives when people go to the pumps or to their filling stations.<\/p><p>  I am talking about it even as an alternative to the electricity chargers.  As things stand, they will only take off, from a cost and an effectiveness point of view, in cities and on short journeys.  In the rural areas I represent, I cannot see them taking off unless there are advances in technology and in the output from the batteries.  <\/p><p>  In the context of the framework for energy and climate, which is under discussion, I note the Commission's proposals will set out a new set of indictors to ensure a competitive and secure energy system.  I think the Minister also mentioned an affordable system.<\/p> <p>That will be the crunch point for the ordinary person who has a problem with energy poverty.  We are aware that many people cannot afford to fill their oil tanks in winter.  Renewables are more expensive to develop.  What is the plan to make fuel more affordable in the long term as we invest in renewables?  I understand the initial start-up is more costly but what is the plan to make fuel costs more affordable for the ordinary domestic consumer?<\/p><p> I say that in the context of the maintenance and renewal of local authority housing stock.  Additional funding for same was made available by the Government recently.  Windows and doors are replaced and external insulation is provided.  I am concerned that the heating systems that are being upgraded and installed in houses are traditional oil fired central heating, which can mean people are dependent on oil.  However, if they cannot afford to put oil in the tank they buy coal each week.  How will such a person avoid carbon tax?  What choice does somebody in that situation have?  The questions are relevant.  Unless people can see the benefit of renewables in the short to medium term and are assured that they will not face more and more cost which they cannot afford we will not win the debate.  There is a vague idea that there will be a reduction in cost to the consumer but it must be outlined more clearly for public discourse in order for people to decide whether that is the way forward.  People want to be environmentally responsible but we have become dependent on fossil fuels for technology and lifestyle and the transition cannot be unduly burdensome.   That is recognised by the Department when it comes to business and it is acknowledged that we must be realistic when achieving targets.<\/p><p> We are trying to introduce measures to ensure biodiversity but there is a gap in knowledge among the general public.  I include myself in that regard.  We need to learn more about the importance of biodiversity and the environment.  There is no educational policy on biodiversity other than the green flag initiative which is more prevalent in primary schools than in secondary schools.  Young people get an appreciation of what is involved.  They look at ecosystems on a minute basis.  In most cases we pass such things by and do not appreciate the value of taking measures to preserve biodiversity.  There is a need for renewable energy policies, wind energy and biodiversity to feature more in the education system at primary and secondary levels and not be left to the individual as to whether he or she wants to embrace a sustainable, environmental response to the way we live and how we engage with the environment.  We must be more proactive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500005#F01200","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401960300,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Deputy Mulherin has asked a number of questions.  Overall, the reason for the approach we are taking in terms of the climate and energy agenda is due to the fact that in the past it was always left to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to be concerned with such matters but now every Department must produce sectoral roadmaps on how they will comply with the objectives to which they contributed that are set at Government level.  It is not just a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government per se and for it to take the lead action.  The Department co-ordinates the approach to take.

There are enormous challenges to reduce emissions in transport, energy and agriculture and to accelerate the type of initiatives we need to have in order to meet our targets in 2020.  We have no chance of meeting our transport targets on renewables by 2020 at the current pace.  It would be worthwhile for the committee to have a discussion with the Departments to see what progress is being made in agriculture, transport and energy.  They will be able to elucidate the discussion on issues relevant to them rather than the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of meeting objectives and what policy changes are required in order to deal with many of the issues to which the Deputy referred.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mulherin is correct that the roll out of electric vehicles is very patchy and small in relative terms.  That goes for all the renewable transport initiatives which are rather difficult to attain at the moment.  I would welcome a debate on the sectoral roadmap preparations.  Some of the issues raised by Deputy Mulherin could be included for discussion.  The programmes necessary to roll out the roadmaps will become clear.<\/p><p>  That brings me to the energy retrofit scheme to which Deputy Mulherin referred.  An excellent model has been developed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Sustainable Energy Ireland and the local government system.  A model has been developed for local authority housing stock by which local authorities can help each other in order to meet the objectives of some of the energy retrofit schemes.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is faced with difficult challenges arising from the collapse of the green deal in the UK, for example.  We were considering how we could replicate the scheme in government and then we discovered there were difficulties with the scheme.  One cannot replicate something that has gone wrong in another jurisdiction.  We were fortunate to learn from that.  Equally, the Minister is trying to progress with the energy companies, in particular the ESB, an opportunity by which we can make it easier for people to pay for initiatives they can take in terms of retrofitting their home.<\/p><p>  If one wants to change behaviour the way to do it is by means of financial instruments.  If we want to achieve our objectives on energy and climate change if the fiscal instrument is to have a carbon tax then we cannot have it every way.  However, I agree that we must have compensatory mechanisms for people in fuel poverty arising from the tax.  There is no avoidance of carbon tax.  It is an issue with which we must deal, but we must ensure that the tax is targeted at the areas that are environmentally bad and try to accentuate the good practice in exemptions for the products we are trying to promote.  An example of the approach is smoky fuels.  An all-island study is currently taking place on the issue.  One cannot deal with smoky fuels if one has a smuggling regime that will circumvent much of the policy instruments that have been introduced in order to change behaviour.  We can demonstrate that there are alternative products on the market that are as competitively priced that can meet higher efficiency targets for fuel output and heating.  At the same time we will be able to deal with some of the issues mentioned such as a clean air policy and whether to exempt products or introduce a sliding scale of treatment on the implementation of carbon tax for those alternative products.  Fiscal measures always change behaviour.  I do not think it will be any different in future if we are serious about meeting the objectives of the agenda.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Mulherin about the lack of education on biodiversity.  We have a national plan which is currently being reviewed.  Part of the review should include how we will provide more education on the issues raised.  The green flag scheme in schools is great but it will take a long time for good practice to percolate through the generations.  I have extended the green flag opportunity to secondary schools and to third level.  I hope the programmes will help people and that as pupils come through the primary sector they do not forget about the good practices with which they have been engaged when they go other parts of the education sector.<\/p><p>  There are considerable opportunities in Deputy Mulherin&rsquo;s part of the world for study opportunities and tourism on the raised bogs in the C&eacute;ide Fields and the surrounding area, which is one of the finest and most valuable areas of biodiversity protection in north Mayo.  I accept what the Deputy said.  Perhaps we could review how we promote the protection of biodiversity in the context of the review of the national plan during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500006#G00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1401960300,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I refer to the situation of a local authority tenant in a council house who has had a heating system upgrade.<\/p> <p>I understand that some boilers may be more efficient.

Achieving such reduction will require co-operation across many levels, from the EU to Government and Opposition parties, sectoral interests,non-governmental organisations and the public.  We all have a responsibility to engage in an open and robust debate on the subject.  I am concerned about political point scoring.  The NGOs call for climate change legislation, a justified call, and look for targets to be set.  However when 'progress' is being made, for example on renewable energy and proposals for wind farms, there are objections.  We cannot have it every way.  Sometime soon we must own up to our responsibilities.  If we want to reduce our dependence on oil and coal, we must support wind farms, biomass, hydro power and what other renewable sources are available.  What I see in my own constituency is that when a proposal is made for a wind farm or for a hydro scheme, people are conflicted by the need to protect the biodiversity and the eco systems and use these arguments against the proposals.  There are many conflicting elements that stall the progress of reducing our emissions.  I think we need to be open and frank about the issues and I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p><p>  The EU has a major role in helping to co-ordinate and to incentivise alternatives in the renewable energy sector.  The Minister mentioned that we need to change our behaviour and our work practices.  Three areas have been identified as presenting major challenges and we need to change old dependencies in the agri-sector, industry and transport.  A great deal of work needs to be done to bring these sectors together with the public with us.  Let me give some examples.  The clean air package is one such example.  Traditionally people in small towns, villages and in rural areas have had a high dependency on coal, especially in my region as we do not have access to turf and other burning fuels.  Deputy Hogan mentioned that the small towns are contributing to the emissions and that is the reason the clean air package needs to be addressed.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI appeared before the committee recently.  An open fire is only 20% efficient as 80% of the heat goes up the chimney.  We have incentives for wood pellet boilers, geothermal systems which are justified but they are expensive to install and following installation they are very difficult to manage and control.  In the context of our concerns about fuel poverty I raised the issue of incentivising the installation of a simple stove at that meeting, as a stove has the reverse efficiency of an open fire and is 80% efficient with 20% of the heat going up the chimney.  They are quite cheap.  I accept they still depend on solid fuel, but their use will reduce the amount of fuel used as well as the level of emissions.  It is a great deal cheaper to install it in the houses that Deputy Mulherin has spoken about.  We can have a major impact by introducing small interventions rather than trying to intervene with high cost renewables that have a low impact.  I ask the officials from the SEAI and others to consider the 80% impact rule, whereby low level interventions achieve a high level of return.  There should be incentives for simple measures.  A simple stove can achieve that.  I am only using the stove as an example of what we can do to assist in reducing our carbon emissions and also to assist in taking on board the concerns regarding fuel poverty.<\/p><p>  The EU targets a 58,000 reduction in premature deaths.  I presume that relates to deaths from asthma or cancer related illnesses from the air we breath.  Will the Minister clarify if it relates to carcinogens from industry?  Why has that target been set?<\/p><p>  Does the clean air package apply to waste management facilities?  When it is proposed to install waste management facilities in particular areas the public raises objections on the grounds of odour and air quality.  Does this clean air package that will be discussed at EU level relate to waste management facilities also?<\/p><p>  We all agree that we play our part in the conservation and protection of our eco systems.  I know flooding has been raised in the past at various levels.  I have genuine concerns about the recent flooding, where a riverbank burst its banks and results in extensive flooding.  This has had a significant negative impact on agriculture, agricultural output and most important on the dwellings that have been flooded.  There is a conflict between trying to protect our eco systems but when floods occur there are considerable restrictions on people repairing the riverbank and returning their lands to normal agricultural practice and getting into their homes.  I have had direct experience of it in County Waterford, where the River Suir breached its banks a couple of months ago due to the heavy rainfall in February.  When the people who had to leave their homes because they were flooded went to repair the banks, the bureaucratic barriers they faced were significant.  They needed waste permits, planning permission, environmental impact assessments.  All of this is feeding into a negative reaction from residents in a huge hinterland to protecting diversity and biological habitats.  These farmers have lived along the riverbanks for generations and have protected these habitats and they are now being forced into a negative reaction to special areas of conservation, SACs.  There is public opposition which needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  Introducing policies and directives are all very well but unless the public buys into them we will face significant opposition.  I support protecting eco systems and biological diversity but I am calling for tangible, practical systems or protocols to deal with crisis situations due to flooding or other disasters.  The local authorities and the habitats and wildlife service should collaborate to make it easier to return agricultural lands and residences back to normality and that we end this current bureaucratic mess and tangle.  These are the issues that I, as a public representative, am hearing on the ground.  I know the Minister and his officials go to Brussels with the best of intentions but I think they need to have practical examples of how these European directives are impacting on Irish citizens.  I ask the Minister to address these difficulties in the best interests of our citizens while also keeping in line with the directives we are meant to comply with, and raise them at EU level<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500007#H00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1401960900,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I completely agree with Deputy Coffey's assertion of the significant contradictions in the policy positions of various groups.  On the one hand they want particular objectives at national level and they regularly discuss with me the reasons I am not doing more in terms of addressing sectoral challenges in meeting targets for climate change, renewable energy or reducing our emissions generally and at the same time, they are the first to protest and object to progress we are trying to make.  I agree totally that there is a need for all sides of the debate to reflect on how we will meet our objectives.  We cannot have it every way.<\/p><p>  The reason for the clean air package and my great interest in it, is the significant evidence of asthma as well as the experience of those of those in public health about the unintended consequences of normal living.<\/p> <p>This is well documented.  It is in fact documented to the extent that there is an unanswerable case to doing something about it.  Why would a Government want to proceed with a policy that would contribute to more people dying?  We want to do the reverse.  We want to ensure that people have a good quality of life and to save people's lives and keep them out of institutional and expensive care.  The target of 58,000 fewer premature deaths relates to all emissions, including from waste management, and how we can contribute to reducing them.  Emissions are emissions regardless of from where they come.  As such, waste management facilities are included.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's next question, the only thing I can do is cite what happens in Kilkenny.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the local authority and the housing organisations working together and, in the case of the local authorities and housing organisations, using the funding provided by my Department under the retrofit and energy schemes, and in the case of the SEAI, using moneys provided to it by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have adopted a model through which all the stakeholders can achieve their objectives in respect of local authority housing or community facilities, including the provision of stoves in local authority houses.  The 80% rule mentioned by the Deputy already exists but, unfortunately, only in a small number of areas in the country.  There is a model of best practice that could be developed that would pay big dividends for householders and go a long way towards meeting our objectives in terms of energy efficiency.  Perhaps, the SEAI, which is very involved in this, should be the co-ordinator.  However, I believe that working together the local authorities, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the housing unit of my Department would be the better co-ordinator and could achieve a more accelerated programme which people would buy into in terms of having more heat in their homes and greater efficiency in terms of the use of that energy.  <\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy on the need for common sense in the implementation of our statutory responsibilities at a time of crisis.  I have seen at first-hand the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the River Suir.  The system is overly bureaucratic and not fit for purpose in terms of it not being able to deal with crises, leaving people through no fault of their own but owing to unexpected and unintended consequences as a result of weather having to deal with this bureaucracy.  This is contributing to a negative view of European directives and some of the organisations in this State dealing with these matters.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service needs to review the type of measures it implements in a time of crisis.  I recently accompanied Deputy Coffey on a visit to a house which had been flooded and saw first-hand the mayhem and uncertainty for people in terms of what they needed to do or from where they will find the means to provide a home and so on for the following few months.  Some cases have taken six or 12 months to resolve.  Protocols are required for crisis management.  Common sense is a little suspect in regard to matters relative to a crisis, particularly in the context of storm damage and flooding.  I will communicate with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, on how we can get the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the local authorities, the OPW and other stakeholders around the table to work out the protocol for which the Deputy has called and which I fully support.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500007#H00400","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401961500,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I understand that there is already in existence some crisis management protocol for State agencies.

Perhaps the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht could work with sectoral interests like the IFA and others on putting in place a protocol that works and will have the support of citizens.  The business community has in place business continuity crisis management plans.  The definition of crisis management is common sense applied in a structured manner.  That is what we need in regard to the application of EU directives.  When directives impact negatively on people's livelihoods, homes and families and thus the wider community it turns people against them.  The message I would like the Minister to bring to Europe is that we need practical directives to allow us manage crises effectively.  Otherwise, we will manage them in a manner which protects our ecosystems and biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014060500008#J00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1401961500,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I support that.

Has the Minister had an opportunity to review the statements made earlier this week in Europe?  As I said, earlier in the week there was huge concentration initially on the &euro;2 billion correction in our budget.  Today, the focus is on agriculture and possible fines in relation to the CAP scheme.

We are not only under pressure in respect of the agriculture and transport sectors but from the energy sector in terms of our renewable energy targets.

We are concerned about the fact that the State may face the prospect of fines, particularly in the energy area where we are experiencing serious problems arising out of some remodelling done recently.

As the representative body for Irish business, IBEC is a strong supporter of the negotiations on an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership agreement.  For a number of years we have been working with our European business partners to grow business support for these negotiations.  <\/p><p>  In April a business delegation led by Business Europe's president, Ms Emma Marcegaglia; its CEO, Mr. Markus Beyrer, and me as chair of the US network of Business Europe visited Washington to emphasise the need for the European Union and the United States to show progress and concrete results in the TTIP negotiations in order to retain the support of business.  The European business group emphasised its strong commitment to the conclusion of a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.  The delegation met the US trade representative, Mr. Mike Froman, Members of Congress and high level government officials from the USTR, the Department of Commerce and the White House.  The group also met Mr. Tom Donohue, CEO and president of the US Chamber of Commerce, and other business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Transatlantic Business Council.  The visit took place ahead of the fifth round of TTIP negotiations which took place from 19 to 23 May.<\/p> <p>A small subgroup of the delegation, of which I was a member, met the IMF managing director, Ms Christine Lagarde, to discuss economic, trade and financial issues.<\/p><p> IBEC recently launched a new campaign, \"An Ireland that Works\", which sets out the business priorities for the next phase of recovery.  It has five key policy priorities: to reduce the tax burden; better government; to invest in the future; to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship; and to extend Ireland's global reach.  Central to the aim of extending Ireland's global reach is completing agreements with the United States, Asia and other trading partners to support trade and investment opportunities for Irish and EU businesses.  International trade deals are building blocks of dynamic economies and we need more of them to match the ambition of our companies.<\/p><p> A transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, agreement has the potential to lay the foundations for a new and dynamic phase of economic renewal in both the European Union and the United States.  It would constitute the most important bilateral trade initiative ever negotiated and as a trading nation with strong cultural and economic links with the United States, Ireland is particularly well placed to benefit.  It remains one of the world's most open economies.  Irish business is increasingly global in focus, based on innovative manufacturing and internationally traded services.  Last week I was in the OECD and it was a great pleasure to see that the OECD study of restrictions on services trade across 40 countries in 18 sectors had found that Ireland was below the OECD average - meaning more open - in all 18 sectors.  On internationally traded services, this market has been proved to be extremely open.  Our prosperity will be determined by important economic and strategic links with global partners.  Investment and trade success will be central to our economic recovery and prosperity and we must continue to foster these international linkages.<\/p><p> Although the United States is already one of Ireland's key export markets, a new trade deal has the potential to increase significantly the value and volume of our exports.  The potential for job creation, new investment and growth is very significant.  Business here would benefit from lower costs, increased opportunities for investment, a reduced regulatory burden and new public procurement opportunities.  However, the TTIP negotiations will not be easy, but it is in everybody's interests to have a major trade and investment deal agreed for the long-term benefit of both economies.  With a combined population of 800 million people and almost half of the world's GDP, the rewards for Irish business and consumers would be well worth the effort.<\/p><p> The benefits of TTIP for Irish business are wide-ranging and very substantial.  TTIP will deliver products to the market cheaper and faster and enable business to be conducted more easily.  It will ensure the harmonisation and promotion of high level standards and stimulate creativity and innovation.  It will make public contract opportunities more accessible and encourage and protect investment.  It will widen the choice of services and help to rebalance raw materials and energy markets.<\/p><p> The benefits of TTIP which have greater significance in an Irish context include tariffs, non-tariff barriers, standard services and investment.  Many products made in Ireland and exported to the United States face costly import duties; the same applies to US firms hoping to sell here.  From machinery manufacturers to the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, millions of euro and dollars are paid to customs authorities each year, costing businesses and consumers alike.  This would be far better spent on much-needed investment.  Irish exporters shipped &euro;86.9 billion worth of goods to more than 200 countries in 2013.  The United States increased its status as Ireland's largest goods export market, growing by almost 1.3% year on year to some &euro;18.4 billion.  Customs duties or tariffs apply to most of these products, which impacts on price.  Tariffs, on average, are 4%, which is low.  Eliminating these tariff barriers will generate impressive savings owing to large trade flows.  The volume of trade flows is very significant and although the tariffs are low, they are still a significant cost.  One of the first objectives of TTIP will be to eliminate tariffs for products either immediately or over a period of time.  <\/p><p> TTIP will enable business to be conducted more easily.  Irish exporters of goods and services sometimes face major problems with non-tariff trade barriers.  These obstacles stem from divergences between EU and US regulators such as different technical regulations, specification standards, conformity assessment procedures, licensing procedures and the lack of information on regulatory systems.  The vast majority of these regulations are different because they are devised independently, not because of divergent public policy choices on either side of the Atlantic.  They do not mean standards are lower in the United States or the European Union, but that they are different and have been drawn up in different ways.  Improving co-operation between both administrations and the regulatory authorities will help to eliminate differences and trade to move more freely and efficiently.  The potential benefits of regulatory co-operation will vary from sector to sector.  The harmonisation of legal provisions will be possible only when standards and licensing procedures are comparable in terms of the level of protection provided and effectiveness.  However, sectors of interest to Ireland such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices and technology, financial services and food and drink are set to benefit from greater levels of regulatory co-operation and in such a way that the consumer will not suffer any lack of protection or the lowering of standards.<\/p><p> Small and medium-sized enterprises have much to gain as they cannot afford to navigate two regulatory systems.  TTIP is the first EU trade agreement that has committed to including a chapter targeting SMEs and providing for their needs.  Such a chapter could establish mechanisms to enable both sides to work together to facilitate SMEs' participation in transatlantic trade after TTIP takes effect.  Provisions could also include an SME committee that could engage with the small business community and the development of web-based information and other resources to help SMEs understand the provisions of the agreement and how they can benefit from it.<\/p><p> TTIP will promote the harmonisation and promotion of high, level standards.  Differences in approach between the European Union and the United States to standards are a significant impediment to the further integration of the world's two largest markets.  They also work against the development of global value chains, which has been highlighted by the OECD, the WTO and the United Nations.  Products often need to be tested twice - once against EU standards and once against the equivalent US standards - before being accepted for sale in both markets.  This brings about higher costs that deter trade and investment, impacting negatively on consumers and the competitiveness of Irish and European business.  Increasing co-operation on standards would lower costs and open markets for business.  It would also allow the European Union and the United States to promote high standards in the transatlantic market and beyond.  <\/p><p> TTIP will widen the choice of services being offered.  Ireland is a strong performer in services exports, which grew by 11% to a value of &euro;90.3 billion in 2012.  Services now account for over 50% of the total value of Irish exports.  This reflects the growth in ICT and e-business sectors, as well as the services operations of many manufacturing firms, financial services, leasing - in the aviation sector, for example - and international education service companies.<\/p> <p>To maintain this trend our services markets must be further integrated, and TTIP can facilitate this by removing the remaining barriers and regulatory-based discrimination by laying down rules to prevent further barriers from arising in future.  A key part of TTIP is examining the future and how regulations are developed.<\/p><p> TTIP will make public contract opportunities more accessible.  The US public procurement market is, after the EU, the second largest in the world, representing 11% of US GDP.  Its growth potential is significant at the federal, state and local level.  However, there are barriers which prevent Irish and European companies from realising their full potential in accessing the US procurement market.  For example, public tenders often include some \"buy America\" clauses which give preference to domestic companies, and TTIP offers an opportunity to address restrictions, simplify non-transparent rules and procedures and improve access to markets.  This can be done not only at the federal level, but, more importantly, at the state level in the United States.  This would enable more Irish companies in sectors such as energy and infrastructure, software, accounting and professional services to participate in US public contract opportunities.<\/p><p> TTIP would also encourage and protect investment.  An important consideration for companies when making investment decisions is whether they are adequately protected.  A key objective of TTIP would be to ensure that EU company investments would be protected in the US, and US company investments would be protected in Europe.  It will grant neutrality in the case of conflict through a comprehensive state-of-the-art investor to state dispute settlement mechanism.  This is important not only for the TTIP agreement, but also for other free trade and investment agreements negotiated across the world.  If the EU and US can agree to have standards for investment protection in their own agreement, they can be replicated elsewhere in negotiations.  Ireland is somewhat of an outlier in an EU context in that it does not have bilateral investment treaties in place.  However, this dispute settlement mechanism is a common practice in free trade agreements and in other member states' bilateral investment treaties, which come to a total of approximately 1,400.  This provision has enhanced the confidence of EU investors, which are by far the largest group of investors in the world, with more than &euro;4 trillion of stock outside the EU.<\/p><p> For the outlined reasons TTIP is worth the effort, ambition and commitment of both the EU institutions and the US Administration, as it could achieve a ground-breaking deal for both economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500003#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401974700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I represent the Irish Exporters Association, the representative body for Irish exporters.  We are the voice of these exporters; we provide practical knowledge to Irish exporters through a range of geographical fora and some bodies like the life sciences and food and drink sectors; and we also provide practical connectivity into overseas markets and various agencies at home.  We aim to get more Irish companies to export for the first time and more exports from existing Irish and overseas companies based in Ireland.  In particular, we speak about competitiveness and the access to finance issue.<br \/>Today, I will refer to the impact of TTIP at a macro level, the issue of small and medium enterprises and the dissemination of TTIP or how to get the process to companies on the ground, as there is a bit of a minefield in trying to get the information out.  To echo Mr. Ivory's comments, we welcome TTIP enormously as it is an important development which will increase trade through its main tenets of reducing existing tariffs and non-tariff barriers, harmonising regulatory frameworks in food safety, e-commerce and data privacy, although there are such privacy issues within the European Union anyway.  It also concerns regulatory frameworks in aviation standards, retail trade, architecture, engineering, finance, procurement and telecoms.  From a global perspective, the impact of TTIP will not be confined to the EU and the US, and as this would become the largest trading bloc in the world, it would probably set the standards for the entire world.  To trade with either bloc, one would need to adopt the standards of both TTIP regions.<br \/>This EU and US trade corridor would create a balance over time for emerging economies and other power blocs around the world and it would facilitate 1.5% growth in both the EU and the US.  EU exports to the US and <i>vice versa<\/i>would increase up to approximately 20% and the process would bring a boost of approximately &euro;100 billion for the EU.  As the US is a very important market for Ireland, there would be a particular boost for Irish exports, as 21% of merchandise exports go from Ireland to the US.  It is a very important market that is not restricted to merchandise exports, as it takes in services, which make up 53% of what we sell from this country.  It is important to consider this global impact, which would have wider implications in the setting of standards around the world and not just in Ireland and the EU.<br \/>I will speak particularly to the implications for small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  In the EU and Ireland, 90% of businesses are small to medium enterprises and they are a dominant part of the economy in Ireland.  There are not enough small to medium enterprises exporting and we would like to see more doing so.  SMEs are currently disproportionately affected by the lack of TTIP or a harmonisation process, as it costs proportionately much more for an SME to deal with red tape, customs and other issues for market entry into different countries.  The harmonisation of such issues would benefit SMEs in particular.  If an SME is building a product or selling a service, it must meet Irish or EU regulatory needs and if it goes to the US, in some cases it must design an entire product but at the least, the product must be tweaked, which involves a cost.  For an SME, such a cost is proportionately far greater than that for a very large company.  This partnership would reduce such costs and make the SMEs much more competitive.  If there is a single set of standards, a product can be built for sale in both blocs.<br \/>We have spoken about documentation, customs and hidden barriers, and the time it takes to get a product through various stages of paperwork overseas can sometimes put off SMEs in going to such markets.  There must be a resource in the SME to handle such processes, which is an extra cost, whereas large organisations can build it in.  Moving to harmonisation and standardisation would reduce such costs for an SME.  Many SMEs develop niche products with high technology or a high capacity focused on a niche market.  Currently, if the company needs to produce a niche product or service to a set of different standards, it would also cause an increased cost.  Moving to similar standards and harmonisation would, therefore, open a new set of markets for niche producers.<br \/>SMEs drive job creation and innovation and TTIP would open this process completely, creating a major impact for SMEs.  Mr. Ivory has already mentioned this but this could get SMEs into a global supply chain perspective rather than one limited to the EU.  Many SMEs have considered getting into overseas operations of some American companies which they supply, and this could open the door considerably for such businesses.<br \/>We must watch the government procurement section and although it should lead to more transparency, SMEs tend to fare a little worse on the Government procurement side than the larger counterparts in Europe.  We have reached a tipping point in Irish exporting as 53% of exports are now services whereas the majority of them have traditionally been merchandise trade.<\/p> <p>The EU and the US are the world's largest service providers.  Many service providers are SMEs, comprising engineers, accountants and tax advisers who have a great deal of particular expertise in that area, and this would facilitate their business.  We welcome it from those points of view.<\/p><p> If one Googles TTIP one goes through hundreds of websites to find out exactly what it is doing.  I do not get many inquiries from our members about TTIP so there is a need to get the information out.  While it is incumbent on organisations like ours to share that information, it would be very useful to have a single source where the information is pulled together, where developments within it, and a general understanding, could be pushed out to people.<\/p><p> We absolutely welcome TTIP.  The large overseas companies that bring a great deal of inward investment to the Irish economy, as it is currently constructed, would benefit from it.  We agree with Mr. Ivory's comments about certain sectors.  It could have massive potential for indigenous SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401975300,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Dr. Werner Raza from the Austrian Foundation for Development Research.

As the Chairman mentioned I have been invited to present some of the results of a study I undertook together with American academics, Professor Lance Taylor and Professor Rudi von Arnim from the New School University in New York and the University of Utah, respectively.  In that study we scrutinised four widely cited reports commissioned by the European Commission, by the German Bertelsmann Foundation and a French study on the supposed benefits of the TTIP agreement.  These studies were commissioned during the past two or three years.  In addition to assessing the findings of these reports we also discussed some issues which are frequently neglected by trade impact assessments but are nevertheless important from our point of view.<\/p><p>  In a nutshell, we see limited economic gains and considerable downside risks.  The results of our assessment are as follows.  The estimated gains of TTIP will be small, with all four studies reporting small but positive effects on real income as measured by GDP, trade flows and real wages in the European Union.  Most studies estimate GDP and real wage increases to range from 0.3% to 1.3% of EU real income.  EU unemployment will either remain unchanged, by assumption, in three of the four studies or it will be reduced by up to 0.42 percentage points, that means approximately 1.3 million jobs.  This, however, appears unrealistic.  This is an outlier.  It was in the study commissioned by the Bertelsmann Foundation which uses a different methodology which has been widely criticised by most trade economists over the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Werner Raza"},{"type":"speech","time":1401975300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Is that an increase in employment of 1.3 million jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500006#G00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401975300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>That is an increase in employment.

It has not been broken down to individual countries.  If one did a trade or employment weighted disaggregation, it would perhaps translate to between 10,000 and 20,000 jobs in Ireland.  Those benefits are long-term.  They will accrue only over a period of ten or more years.<\/p><p>  The press mistakenly presented TTIP as giving an economic boost to the EU in the short term.  That will not happen.  The implementation of the agreement will take time and the effects of the economic gains from the agreement will thus accrue only in the long term.<\/p><p>  Second, the estimated gains depend on the reduction of non-tariff measures.  The previous two speakers already mentioned that for EU and US industries, this agreement focuses on regulatory harmonisation and alignment.  Since the two economic regions are already well integrated because tariff barriers are at very low levels of 2% to 3%, on average, any further economic benefit must come from the reduction of non-tariff measures.  In that sense we are no longer speaking about a conventional free trade agreement but it is an agreement about regulatory change or alignment.  A total of 80% of the estimated gains I have mentioned will come from the alignment of non-tariff measures, which are all kinds of laws, regulations, technical standards, licensing requirements and processes which differ in the two regions, as elaborated by the previous speakers.<\/p><p>  In the studies the assumptions on how much those regulations can be aligned or reduced have been bold, for example, in most of the studies it is assumed that 25% to 50% of those regulations can be aligned to some common standard or harmonisation, or will be subject to mutual recognition.  That is a crucial assumption.  The other crucial assumption is that it has been commonly assumed in those studies that these regulations present a cost to businesses, which they do.  That cost has been assessed by means of surveying company managers and receiving their assessment of the cost of certain regulations to their companies.<\/p><p>  The other side of the coin, in terms of assessing the costs and benefits of regulations, would be to assess the social cost of a reduction or elimination of a regulation.  This has not been done which in our view is a methodological flaw in most of those studies.  It is well established in economic theory that regulation is welfare enhancing in so far as it corrects for market failure or in so far as it is used to secure certain public policy goals - public health, security, environmental protection, social regulation etc.  If one changes regulation, either by harmonisation or by abolishing certain regulations, that will have a negative effect on the safeguarding of those public policy goals.  That presents a social cost.  None of these studies takes account of this.  Our conclusion is that it is one-sided.  It takes into account the cost savings for companies but not the potential social costs of deregulation or regulatory alignment.  Policy-makers in the European Union and the member states must scrutinise it in great detail to establish how far regulatory changes, harmonisation or mutual recognition as introduced by the agreement will lead to changes in the quality of regulation.  That is the third point.<\/p><p>  The fourth point is that none of those studies takes into account macroeconomic adjustment costs.  These macroeconomic adjustment costs can accrue in three areas.  They can accrue in the labour market because there will be shifts in employment within sectors, and potentially also between sectors because of the agreement, resulting in unemployment and related costs.  That includes long-term unemployment.  These costs might be substantial, especially during the ten year transition period.  Based on projected job displacement, in a study by CEPR, of between of 400,000 and 1.1. million, a rough and conservative calculation suggests implied costs of &euro;5 billion to &euro;14 billion in unemployment benefit, excluding costs for retraining and skills acquisition.  We assume there will be temporary unemployment and that is also assumed by the studies because while some sectors will be negatively affected by the trade agreement through input competition, others will be positively affected by it because it promotes additional exports.<\/p> <p>There will, therefore, be sectoral shifts in employment as well as a level of temporary unemployment.  We also expect that there will, at least partially, be long-term unemployment as a result of the agreement.  There are very different conditions in the various EU countries in terms of the labour market situation, with high levels of unemployment in some.  It would be too bold to assume, as some of the studies do, that all of the temporary unemployment that will arise as a consequence of the agreement will be resolved by the persons affected finding new jobs that pay the same wage as before.<\/p><p> If we take that into account in the economic analysis, as we should, we can see there will be adjustment costs in the labour markets.  As I said, our estimations suggest that those costs for the European Union as a whole will be between &euro;5 billion and &euro;14 billion in the ten year transition period.  In addition, according to our estimation, forgone public income from taxes and social contributions from unemployed persons could accrue to between &euro;4 billion and &euro;10 billion in the same period.  Another important factor is the effect of TTIP on public revenue income.  We estimate that revenue losses for the EU budget as a result of tariff elimination - tariff income, after all, goes into the public budgets - could be in the order of 2%, or &euro;2.6 billion per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500006#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Werner Raza","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401975900,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Will the United States gain as a consequence of those losses to the EU, or will it also see a loss?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500007#H00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401975900,"counter":212,"content":"<p>There will be a corresponding loss for the US once it has reduced or eliminated remaining tariffs on manufactured goods and agricultural imports from the EU.  Both the US and the EU will lose revenue in the form of tariffs.  Reducing tariff rates is the very essence of a free trade agreement and that leads to a reduction in public income.  The EU budget will, in all likelihood, experience a loss of &euro;2.6 billion per year.  Accumulated over a transition period of ten years, this would accrue to a loss of EU public revenues of at least &euro;20 billion.  Part of that loss will be compensated for by increasing exports and output as a consequence of the agreement, but that is a long-term process.  In the short term, the net effect on the public budget will be negative.<\/p><p>  There could be additional potential negative effects of TTIP.  For example, exports from least developed countries, LDCs, to the EU will possibly suffer, with a potential reduction in their real GDP of up to 3%.  This is a rather straightforward conclusion from trade theory.  If two countries or regions enter into a trade agreement, there will be trade diversion away from third countries or regions, with the latter seeing their exports diminish as a consequence.  One could say, therefore, that there will be a negative effect on the rest of the world arising from TTIP.  Empirically, the magnitude of that effect is not entirely conclusive.  Certainly, given the EU's official commitment to eradicating poverty in LDCs, the results obtained by the four studies warrant a detailed examination of the possible effects of TTIP on developing countries.<\/p><p>  Finally, intra-EU trade will probably decrease because of TTIP.  Some studies suggest a modest reduction, but one estimation is that intra-EU exports will decline by 30%.  That seems a very high figure and perhaps not plausible.  On the other hand, it certainly seems likely that trade between EU member states will decrease because it will be substituted by imports from the US, to some extent at least.  However, the studies do not give very precise information on this very important issue, which calls for further examination.<\/p><p>  In our view, TTIP will, in the long run, give positive but very small economic effects.  It has been our aim to show that some of the potentially negative effects which flow from regulatory change and macroeconomic adjustment costs have not been considered to the degree they should by policy-makers.  That is the basic message of our study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Werner Raza"},{"type":"speech","time":1401975900,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.

With a given income, households can afford to buy more.  That is what is measured by the studies to which I referred.  The figure of 0.5% to 1% of GDP refers to the income gain to households in Europe.  It is not a growth effect.

I wanted to restate some of the comments I made here last month before the Minister that Mr. McKeever and Mr. Ivory may not have heard.  As a nation and as business interests we sing from the same hymn sheet.  If we denied the benefits and huge savings that these reports indicate, we would be deemed lunatics.  Having read the memo of the European Commission on the benefits of this deal, how could anyone fail to argue for it?<\/p><p>  I was concerned by the fact that the statistics and economic outlines are produced by a group called the Centre for Economic Research, which may be similar to Dr. Werner Raza's group.  Economic researchers were commissioned by the EU to produce these figures and I have now heard that the European United Left has commissioned Dr. Raza's company to argue the points he has just made.  How do we reach the truth?  I think we all agree that tariffs of 3% are not the big issue.  Rather, savings of 80% can be made in other fields.  I am not an expert in any field but the European Commission has said that standards will not fall.  I will take the example of the Irish pharmaceuticals industry, including the Irish Medicines Board, and I have already raised this with the Minister.  There are 28 countries in the European Union and I do not know what standards are applied in the other 27.  Does the Irish Medicines Board have the highest ranking or the lowest in the European Union?  Companies based in Ireland that export to the United States must comply with the stringent conditions of the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  I think the theory that has been presented is to get rid of the FDA, the Irish Medicines Board and their equivalent and replace them with a standard not less than the best that currently exists.  How can this be proven?<\/p><p>  I welcome Dr. Werner Raza in particular as Ireland has much experience of the arguments of economists from both sides of the fence.  Many of these economists did not realise that the Irish economy was experiencing a bubble so it is important we hear the counter argument commissioned by the European Commission.  It seems to me that the Austrian Foundation for Development Research is not arguing strongly that there will not be benefits.  Rather, it accepts that there are benefits to be gained while there are also potential risks.  A risk may materialise with the worst possible consequences or it may not materialise at all.  Can Dr. Raza summarise his position?  Is he suggesting the talks should stop and things should remain static because they are fine as they are, or is he saying additional benefits may accrue if we adopt some of his suggestions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500008#J00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1401976500,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I am not an expert and I do not believe any of the committee members are.  My concern is that this is potentially a huge deal but there has been no real debate on it.  There have been headlines in newspapers but there has been no real information behind them on the talks.  A veil of secrecy covers the discussions that are ongoing and what the impact will be.  It concerns me that some people suggest that everything will be great because there must be a downside to any agreement.  However, nobody has spoken of a potential downside and this signals to me that a debate is required to examine this area.  I welcome the fact that this committee is examining this matter because prior to this only headlines in newspapers addressed the topic.  People I have spoken to in the United States tell me there is more debate there on the impact this will have, with greater involvement from civil society and interest groups.  Why has the same level of scrutiny not applied in Ireland and other European countries?  Some feel this matter really relates to deregulation, which can be a good or bad thing.  As Deputy Byrne asked, what are we deregulating and what impact will it have?<\/p><p>  The headlines say &euro;500 billion or &euro;600 billion, depending on which newspaper one reads, and refer to increased trade, growth and jobs.  The perception is that only a mad person would oppose an increase in jobs and growth and the agreement should be signed immediately.  However, negotiations are ongoing and there is a lack of scrutiny in the Irish Parliament, the European Parliament and other parliaments.  I welcome that the report has been commissioned.  I do not think that the fact the report has been commissioned by the European United Left group means the independent researchers will be required to come to negative conclusions.  The report does not point out only negative issues.<\/p><p>  If we agree this is primarily about deregulation, how can we say there will more regulations or fewer?  We have not yet agreed and negotiations are ongoing.  There is a concern in Europe and the United States that social and environmental protections will be rolled back as a result of this.  Nobody has mentioned the difference in regulation of genetically modified, GM, foods.  Ireland has a view on this matter and the United States has a different one.  Have the Irish Exporters Association and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation concerns about this?  Ireland has attracted multinational companies because it is seen as a gateway to Europe.  Will this partnership have an impact on this?  What is the point in having the companies, particularly US companies, in Ireland if there is no need to do so?  Is this a concern?  Perhaps it is not.<\/p> <p>Some studies have ignored this area.  It is all seen as positive.<\/p><p> There has not been any mention of investor-state dispute settlements.  We know from other trade agreements with Canada and Australia that difficulties arise in this regard.  This is supposed to empower investors to challenge countries in international courts.  The Government's ability to respond on issues relating to climate change or health policy without fear of trade litigation could be compromised.  In Canada, a case was taken against the Quebec federal government.  In Australia a case was brought over plain packaging of cigarettes.  The Canadian case involved fracking.  The can is being kicked down the road in regard to fracking in Ireland but a multinational company would be able to take this State to court on the basis that we interfered with its trade.  Does that not sound the alarm bells?  Are the witnesses concerned that we might be sued over plain packaging of cigarettes?  Is that dumbing up or dumbing down health regulations?<\/p><p> It has been suggested that TTIP will reduce trade within the EU by up to 30%.  It makes sense that if one throws the balls up in the air, they will land differently.  That is what we are doing.  There may be a positive outcome for some countries but others will be negatively affected depending on their level of development.  Any change, whether through agreement between countries or otherwise, must be examined for the positives and the negatives.  We are not hearing those voices.  If certain industries are to be deregulated, will that not have a social impact?  What is the trade union movement doing in Ireland?  We have not heard from it in this debate.  We have heard from the employers' federations and others but this is going to impact on workers, particularly those in vulnerable jobs.  Is that a good or a bad thing?  If there is potential for such huge change in employment levels, why have we not given it more attention?<\/p><p> If we achieve this greater agreement between the two biggest power blocs in the world, the US and Europe, emerging nations and least developed countries will find the environment more difficult.  We are being told that the barriers are coming down and that trade between countries will be seamless.  It will be harder to break into this bigger bloc.<\/p><p> It is refreshing to have a debate but all of us must put on our thinking hats.

Mr. McKeever is the chief executive of my nominating body for the Seanad.  I congratulate the Irish Exporters Association on the superb job it does on behalf of small, medium and multinational companies.  Its membership comprises an extraordinary group of companies.<\/p><p>  It was a pleasure to hear Dr. Raza's fresh perspective on this potential treaty.  I agree with Deputy Crowe that the newspapers and political talk in Ireland generally deal with crises or scandals and rarely deal with the reality of economic proposals.  They are ignored.  They might be announced when a report is launched but there is no public discussion.  I speak from personal experience because in the last recession I co-founded Lir Chocolates along with another lady.  We did not have a pen or a pencil but we worked 24-7 for 16 years, including Christmas Day and New Year's Day.  I have been a full-time politician since 2002 but I am also a board member of Lir Chocolates, which is now owned by a renowned German company.  From my experience on the ground, I found Dr. Raza's comments very realistic in terms of things that appear to be attractive to a company considering trade with another company.  In our early years we won an award in Japan for the quality of our products and we subsequently received an opportunity to export to that country.  It sounded brilliant but there were too many regulatory barriers and layers of bureaucracy because Japan did not want imports.<\/p><p>  There is no future for SMEs to expand in Ireland because our market is too small.  Most of Lir Chocolate's sales come from exports to Europe and further afield.  The key to success for SMEs is to be innovative because they will not be wanted unless they bring something unique to the market.  It took me seven years to persuade Baileys to allow us to produce a box of Baileys chocolates because it did not allow its name to be used on anything other than the drink.  Every time I came close to doing a deal, the chief executive went off somewhere else and I had to start from scratch.  I refer to small and medium start-up companies rather than multinationals or big Irish companies.  We have extraordinarily successful and world class agrifood companies.  Innovation is key.  We were able to grow our business internationally because we made boxes of Baileys chocolates, which were unique.  It requires incredible perseverance and creativity to come up with a product that will find a niche.<\/p><p>  It was very refreshing to read Mr. Raza's report and to listen to his comments.  It sounds like a good idea to bureaucrats in Brussels and the United States, who are not involved in trade.  Bureaucrats have always thought it would be a great idea for Europe to draw up a trading agreement with the United States.  However, the bureaucrats in Brussels do not have any understanding of the skills required to export.  I agree that people will lose out.  Over the last 48 hours, a US Democratic Party Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, intervened with Bausch and Lomb, which is seeking to save &euro;20 million in costs and to let 200 people go.<\/p> <p>Senator Schumer invited Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb back to Rochester, New York, and we are talking about friendly relations between the US and Ireland.  This is a cold-blooded look at the reality of doing trade and I compliment the committee on discussing it.  I will raise the reality of it in the Seanad next week.  I found the presentation realistic from my experience.  We decided not to deal with Japan because it was too expensive.  I could talk for a week about where one does and does not do business because of the costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500009#K00200","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401977700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Was it expensive due to regulations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500010#L00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401977700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>There were non-financial barriers.

We have worked with the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland, Europe and the US and they have agreed on a way of doing regulation that makes more sense, for example, the inspection of plants.  A pharmaceutical plant must be inspected to European and US standards.  The same plant could be inspected to two different standards by two sets of regulators, bringing regulators across the Atlantic to carry out these tests, for example, on good manufacturing practice.  The drugs are sold in Europe and the US and are very safe, so it is not a question of different standards of protection or health for consumers but slightly different regulations.  This agreement proposes mutual recognition of each other's standards so the EMA, or the Irish Medicines Board carrying out the work of the EMA, would carry out the tests here.  It might carry out tests on a plant using EU standards and then apply the corresponding US standards.  Similarly, the regulators in the US could examine the two standards and ensure a factory meets both standards.  It is about a more sensible way of doing business and reducing costs.<\/p><p>  If one goes to the US and hires a car, one does not feel unsafe driving it.  An American who comes to Europe and hires a car does not feel unsafe driving it, yet if one sells a car in the European or US market there are different regulations for windscreen wipers, lights and indicators.  They have nothing to do with the safety of passengers or pedestrians.  Regulations are different because they have been formulated by a different system.  The EU and US car industries have met and agreed to recognise each other's standards, and the cars are still safe for Europeans and Americans to drive.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Crowe's question, we are delighted to debate the issues with anybody.  We have debated the issues with European parliamentarians.  We invited the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament to Ireland and European parliamentarians from across Europe attended.  The only one who did not attend was the Irish MEP at that time.  As he is not one of the new MEPs, I hope that situation will change.  We welcome debate and discussion in any sense.  Many economic studies have shown international trade agreements raise growth levels in economies, and this raises investment levels and job opportunities for people.<\/p><p>  On the possibility that the least developed countries could lose out because of this major deal between the EU and the US, we must see this in the context of a broader trade agenda here in Europe and in the US.  Europe is also negotiating free trade agreement with a range of Asian countries, including developing Asian countries such as Vietnam.

One needs to be conscious of the fact that we are 4.6 million people while the UK, our nearest and largest trading partner, has a market 15 times the size of ours and the EU has a population of 500 million.  Opening the EU market has generated huge growth in Ireland.  One needs to think in a global context that 99.93% of the world's population does not live on this island and, therefore, exporting is the lifeblood of growth.<\/p><p>  On the costs issue raised by Deputy Durkan, big businesses tend to have global operations that can deal with the different customs and tariffs and non-tariff barriers but if one has a small business and it takes 100 people to run it, one might need to employ another person or to pay a consultant to deal with the barriers.  If those barriers do not exist anymore or the regulations are standardised - it is not about deregulation - one does not need to pay to employ that person and, therefore, the business can grow.<\/p><p>  On the LDCs, I would like to challenge that point of view because I do not completely agree with it.  Rather than having to deal with two sets of standards, it might enable them to trade better because they only have to deal with one set of standards and get their heads around that.  If a less developed country has one set of standards to produce its goods and services, surely that will make it easier for the country.<\/p><p>  Our members would welcome the TTIP.

I will address a few of them.  Deputy Barry asked whether I would argue in favour of stopping the talks.  Let me make it clear that I am not an activist.  I am a researcher and, therefore, I am not talking about stopping the negotiations.  I am pointing my finger at some things which have been not highlighted but which should receive more attention from policy makers.  The first thing I wanted to highlight was that with every trade agreement, including TTIP, there are winners and losers.  In the studies and public debate so far, we have been talking mostly about the winners and the losers will be those obviously negatively affected because, for example, they will lose their jobs or they will suffer a deterioration in consumer standards potentially.  We should, therefore, talk clearly about who are the winners and losers.<\/p><p>  In terms of the economic case for the trade agreement, I made it clear there will be on balance positive effects on the economy but I made the case that the economic benefit will not be as large as has been reported in many studies published by the European Commission and others.  Adjustment costs, which every trade agreement involves, are not taken into account in the modelling exercises in those studies.  There will be winners and losers.  On average, we should expect positive effects in the long term.  They will not follow so much from decreasing prices of imported goods.  When one looks closely at price structures and how they evolve, one will find prices are mostly sticky.  Price reductions to some extent take place, particularly in the case of advanced countries that produce and export middle and high technology products.  Prices are sticky and they will be not be reduced.  The advantage in trade agreements in the long run comes from the fact that trade to some extent induces technological advances and innovations.  There is a strand of economic discussion called new trade theory, NTT, and the results of the new theory basically say that companies that export the majority of their goods and services are on average more technology driven than other companies that, in the majority, produce for the local market.  Trade, therefore, induces technological change and that is the kind of trade that then triggers dynamic effects in terms of value added with high productivity production models.  In that sense, trade is positive in the long term.  In the short term, the price effects between two highly industrialised regions such as Europe and US are probably negligible.  That is my assessment in term of the economic gains to be expected.<\/p><p>  The second issue I wanted to address is the regulatory agenda.  I tried to highlight that the agreement to a large degree is about regulation.  It is not so much about tariff abolition because that has been achieved more or less over the past 50 or 60 years.  We are talking about regulatory change.<\/p> <p>It is very difficult to estimate the economic effects of that regulatory change because the methods for doing that - cost-benefit analyses, etc. - are not developed to such a degree as to facilitate or provide a secure foundation for making economic assessments of the overall effect of regulatory change.  The projected cost savings to companies taken into account in those four studies rest on surveys.  Surveys are to some extent prone to bias.  However, estimating the social benefits of regulation is also very difficult.  We have seen in recent years attempts to do that.  The Office of Management and Budget in the US has done impact assessments of the costs and benefits to society in the United States of regulation, including environmental protection regulations and consumer regulations.  It tried to estimate the value of those regulations to society.  Such exercises are methodically problematic.  For example, how does one quantify the value of a life saved because of stringent public health regulations?  A lot of things are being assumed to come up as a certain value.  Nevertheless, those assessments have shown that, during the past ten to 15 years, the benefits of public regulations outweigh the costs by a factor of up to six.  It is important to bear that in mind when discussing those regulatory issues.  Public regulation has a benefit to society.  If it is proposed to change it, even if it is a change only in technical standards, the question we have to ask is whether that change will affect the social benefit to society of that regulation.  If the answer is no, there is no case to be made against harmonisation, alignment or mutual recognition.  However, if it is proposed to introduce mutual recognition of different standards, one standard being more stringent than the other, that might lead to regulatory competition, because companies would perhaps move their production capacity to the jurisdiction with the lowest standard.  These are tricky issues which go beyond the domain of economic analysis, but they are core issues in those negotiations.  The negotiations in the regulatory arena will be complex and involve difficult trade-offs between cost savings for companies and the benefit of regulation to society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500011#M00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Werner Raza","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401978900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe referred to investor-state dispute settlement. I mentioned that in my presentation - the committee may have missed that part of it.  I said that investor-state dispute settlement was about international trade law.  Courts at state or province level - I think that Quebec was mentioned - are not always equipped to deal with international trade law because it is complicated and very different from the type of law with which they normally deal.  That is a reason for the existence of investor-state dispute settlement.  It is important not only within one agreement but in a whole suite of agreements that will span the globe - one might have the same types of provision in free trade agreements with Asian countries, for example.<\/p><p> On the social cost of regulation, I again emphasise that this is not about deregulation but about mutual recognition and closer co-operation.  Nor is it being done in a hurry.  Many of the issues which we have raised through TTIP with regulators - for example, in the pharmaceutical industry - have been talked about for more than ten years.  Pilot projects on those issues have been going on through Transatlantic Economic Council and the EU-US High Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum.  All we are asking is that, after all this work over all those years, a decision be made that one can have mutual recognition.  It is not being done in a hurry.  In no sense is reducing protection being talked about, or reducing standards for civil society or consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014060500012#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Ivory"},{"type":"speech","time":1401978900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank all our guests for attending today and participating in our discussion.

As the Chairman noted, I am joined by Mr. Marty Whelan, our head of communications and stakeholder engagement.  We welcome this opportunity to appear again before the joint committee and to engage with members.<\/p><p>  The authority, as part of the remit given to it by an Act passed by these Houses, is responsible for setting quality and safety standards in health and social care services in Ireland with the exception of mental health services.  Since 2009, HIQA has been responsible for the registration and inspection of designated centres for older and dependent people.  All designated centres for older people are required to be registered by HIQA.  The purpose of this regulation is to safeguard vulnerable people who are receiving residential care services.  Regulation provides an assurance to the public that people living in such designated centres are receiving a service that meets the national quality standards and regulations.  This process also seeks to ensure that the health, well-being and lives of people in residential care are promoted and protected.  While I will speak a little bit more about this, regulation also has an important role in driving continuous improvement in order that residents have better, safer lives.  We endeavour to always publicly share information about the nature and outcomes of our work.<\/p><p>  Today, we are here to discuss our annual overview report of our 2013 regulatory programme in centres for older people.  This is the first overview report that we have produced and we are eager to listen to members' views about how these services provided across the country meet the needs of the communities they represent.  The report describes a national set of residential services that is vastly better and safer since HIQA first engaged with the sector in 2007, following public concern about the Leas Cross nursing home in north County Dublin.  Providers of residential services must be commended on the significant improvements we have witnessed in that span of time.  The report provides an overview of the regulation of long-term residential care in 2013.  As of 31 December 2013, there were 566 designated residential centres for older people in the country.  The majority of these, 75%, were privately provided and the remainder were either provided directly by the Health Service Executive, HSE, or in receipt of HSE funding.<\/p><p>  In essence, the report captures the findings of the 814 inspections of 565 centres that HIQA carried out last year.  Seventy-eight percent of those inspections were carried out on an unannounced basis, while 22% were on an announced basis.  There is a value in unannounced inspections as our inspectors then see a service as it is on that particular day.  However, I wish to reinforce the fact that announced inspections also have a value in the regulatory process, as they enable providers to show us their service as they would like it to be seen, as well as enabling us to have access to information and documentation to which we would not have access on an unannounced inspection.  Good practice in the care of older people was observed in the majority of the centres that we inspected and our inspectors noted improvements in most centres following inspection.  The report also makes clear that there are issues where improvements are required.  HIQA inspection reports are in a standardised format and contain action plans that are aimed at driving improvement locally.  We inspect and report under a maximum of 18 outcomes, each of which is a statement of what we believe is expected under the standards and regulations.<\/p><p>  Outcomes are grouped under five themes, namely, governance, leadership and management, safe care and support, effective care and support, person-centred care and support and the workforce involved in the care of individuals.  Of the more than 8,000 actions that were required by HIQA for compliance across the country&rsquo;s suite of residential care centres, 13% of those actions related to issues concerning governance, leadership and management.  The sort of things which we were looking at included issues concerning the statement of purpose, the contract for the provision of services, the suitability of the person in charge and documentation and records kept within the centre.  A further 31% of actions were related the theme of safe care and support and the sort of things at which we were looking there in respect of improvement were safeguarding vulnerable people, health and safety issues, risk management practices, medication management and the statutory notification of incidents, as required under regulations.  In addition, 34% of the actions were required for improvements related to effective care and support.<\/p> <p>The actions prescribed under this theme dealt with issues of quality and safety of care; how the health and social care needs of residents were being assessed and provided for; and the safety and suitability of premises.<br \/>A central issue in the provision of long-term care of older people is the concept of person-centred care and support.  With regard to a number of actions, 11% were required to effect improvement in this area. These actions were centred on enabling older people to make informed decisions about their care and enabling them to participate in the day-to-day life of the centre.  They also involved issues around the making of complaints and the making of suggestions for improvements in the service.  Of all the actions cited in our reports, 11% related to the workforce providing the care.  The improvements we required were with regard to staff recruitment practices and ensuring the staff in the centre had the required qualities, skills and experiences. <br \/>Shortly after taking up my post as chief inspector and director of regulation, I was keen to ensure that as well as ensuring compliance with standards and regulations, our programme of regulation would place an emphasis on the improvement of services.  This overview report also describes the full findings of a pilot programme of thematic inspections which we introduced late in 2013.  These were aimed at improving particular aspects of care year to year.  The first themes we introduced were aimed at improving some of the most fundamental elements of residential care, including a mechanism for improving end-of-life care and food and nutrition in nursing homes.  The pilot programme consisted of conducting the thematic inspections in a selected representative group of 52 nursing homes.  This section of the report describes both areas of good practice and areas that require improvement.<br \/>In the inspection of the area of food and nutrition, which is a basic and fundamental standard for vulnerable people, over half of the centres were fully compliant with standards relating to food and nutritional care.  Examples of good practice were evident in all of the 52 centres visited.  In 48 of the 52 centres, inspectors found that residents were being supported to eat and drink, with person-centred approaches used in their care.  Our inspectors found that meals were served at times that suited the expressed needs of residents in 42 of the 52 centres that were inspected as part of the pilot programme.<br \/>Given the nature of the age and illness profile of residents, all centres should ensure they have the ability to deliver appropriate and dignified care to people at the end of their lives.  Typically, staff of residential centres have an understanding of the life-limiting conditions that many residents may have.  Overall, we found that residents received appropriate and safe end-of-life care in the 52 centres, with 23 of the 52 centres inspected during the pilot programme being compliant with the relevant standards and regulations.  In 51 of the 52 centres, residents, or family, if appropriate, were given timely information in order to make informed choices about future health events.  In 33 of the centres, residents were given opportunities to discuss their end-of-life wishes, which is a major comfort to them and their families.   Feedback from service providers and the inspection findings both demonstrated the positive impact of the new thematic approach.  As a result of this pilot we are applying the same methods to all remaining designated centres in 2014, with a view to identifying further inspection themes for 2015.<br \/>The report outlines our evolving approaches to the regulation of services.  We regard regulation as a mechanism for improvement and we are always conscious of the burden that regulation can place on providers.  We take very seriously our responsibility as a State agency to provide value for taxpayers' money through our programmes of registration and inspection.  As a regulator, we aim to reduce the overall burden that is placed on service providers wherever possible while maintaining an emphasis on our objectives for safety and quality improvement.  Regulation in the social care sector is intended to help service providers to improve the quality of care for residents, to protect their basic rights and to stop poor or dangerous practice.<b><\/b>We ensure we are targeting our resources at areas of greatest need and highest risk.  A major part of our programme is the registration of services with a requirement to renew the registration every three years.  Renewing a provider's registration is a public confirmation that they have maintained their fitness to carry on the business of running a nursing home.  During 2013, we processed 82 registration related applications.  Fifty two of these applications were registration renewals.<br \/>We recognise the need to ensure our registration process enables the introduction of new beds into the system.  To this end, we have a priority system for the registration of new buildings.  Providers who plan to apply to register a new designated centre are referred to our registration office, which makes them aware of obligations and requirements in respect of the service they intend to provide.  Timelines are shortened to facilitate the swift introduction of quality new beds into the system.<br \/>In certain situations a provider may apply to change or remove a condition of registration.  Applications to reduce the maximum number of residents accommodated in a centre were granted on two occasions last year to centres, and applications to increase the maximum number of residents accommodated were granted to seven centres.  These decisions resulted in an increase of 65 beds in total in 2013.<br \/>The authority's approach to regulation of these centres ensures that those providers who are persistently non-compliant with the standards and regulations and who place people at risk of harm are identified quickly and face proportionate and meaningful enforcement action.  Formal enforcement procedures were used in respect of one centre last year when a decision to cancel registration of the centre was issued in January 2013.  In this case the provider consented to the decision of the authority.  It should be noted that this is only one of 565 designated centres which we inspected in the year at less than 0.2% of the total national complement.  We remain unequivocal in the appropriate application of our enforcement powers when we believe that vulnerable people are at risk.<br \/>The report also describes the findings of a questionnaire we conducted across inspected centres in 2013.  Provider feedback is generally positive about the way we conduct our work, with 91% of providers noting that the inspection process led to service improvement and was helpful in identifying gaps in services.  I would also like to note the quality of self-assessments that were returned to HIQA in 2013 by providers.  Self-assessment is a valuable part of regulation methodology and helps to develop self-awareness of the need for improvement.  Our experience in 2013 noted a substantial correlation between the findings on inspection and providers' own self-assessed judgments.<br \/>Legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas requires nursing home providers to notify us, without delay, of specified incidents involving residents which occur in nursing homes.  The purpose of these notifications is to alert us to potential risks to the health, safety and well-being of residents.  The range includes possible incidents and risks, as well as events that occur.  In 2013 we received 5,362 of these notifications from nursing home providers.  In addition, we also received 355 items of unsolicited information, the majority of which came from residents, relatives of residents and in some instances staff working in the services.  These pieces of unsolicited information came from 213 nursing homes.  All of this information is risk-assessed by our inspectors.  Any risks or other actions required are assessed by our inspectors and applied appropriately.  It should be noted that this figure relates to both confirmed and unconfirmed or suspected abuse of vulnerable adults.  As mentioned, 31% of actions required to comply with the regulations were related to required improvements under the theme of safe care and support.  The safety and interests of vulnerable older people are at the heart of our regulatory and inspection process.  In my view, their well-being and interests would be well-served by enhanced legislation that enshrines in law the safeguarding of vulnerable adults in receipt of care services.  It is important for our work that a culture exists where staff and providers have the confidence to report such matters to the regulator.  HIQA would welcome an opportunity to work with members towards the development of an effective national policy and up-to-date legislation that would address this important issue.<br \/>The overall assessment of the authority is that in the four and a half years since the introduction of regulation of nursing homes in Ireland, there has been significant improvement in the quality of care that is provided to residents.  The authority is using the findings of this overview report and the outcomes of our inspection work to inform our assessment of risk within the sector and to plan for our ongoing and future regulatory activity, such as the selection of areas of care for our ongoing programme of thematic inspections.  Findings on inspections, such as those presented in this report, also inform the guidance we produce which assist providers to improve the quality of their services.  All of this activity, along with a commitment to continued improvements in our regulatory approaches, demonstrates HIQA's commitment to ensure the rights and experiences of older persons in residential care are protected and improved.  We look forward to continuing this important work and to continuing to work with members of the committee in the interests of improving the quality and safety of care provided to older people who live in residential care in this country.<br \/>I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for inviting us here today to discuss this report.  I look forward to hearing their questions and to learning where they believe we can further improve the process of promoting the quality of life for our older generations living in nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401957600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn for his presentation and analysis.<\/p> <p>We all welcome the significant improvement in the quality of care for citizens residing in nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500004#C00200","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Mr. Quinn and Mr. Whelan, representing the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I thank HIQA for its report and the vital role the organisation plays.  This acknowledgement is deserved once again.  When we recall that HIQA was established as a consequence of the failure of self-regulation and the so-called regulation that applied under the Health Service Executive and previously under the health boards, we can appreciate that this is a very important development and one that needs to be encouraged, resourced and facilitated in full.<\/p><p>  Before asking questions, I join the Chairman in extending good wishes to Dr. Tracey Cooper and thanking her for her service as the first chief executive of HIQA in its inaugural years.  She has returned to the land of her birth and we wish her every success and happiness there in her new post.  Has Dr. Cooper been formally replaced?  When will the post of chief executive be filled?  <\/p><p>  This report is an annual overview.  Other colleagues have expressed an interest by asking about X, Y or Z nursing home.  This work has already been done and the report is the collected information provided in 565 reports completed by HIQA in 2013.  Given that 566 centres were registered last year, the first question that strikes me is which of the nursing homes got away.  That is not a serious question.  I am simply noting a slight discrepancy in the statistics the witnesses shared with the joint committee. <\/p><p>  Mr. Quinn picked up again on the issues of safe care and support.  Of the 8,000 actions indicated, 31% were related to required improvements under the theme of safe care and support.  Is it too early to indicate the success rate in meeting these requirements across all of the service centres involved?  Thirty-four percent of actions refer to effective care and support.  Is there any way of carrying out an interim assessment of how these identified actions are being addressed by the service providers involved, whether private for-profit entities or HSE facilities?  Must HIQA await the next opportunity to visit these facilities to determine the way in which the various centres have implemented the required, as opposed to recommended, actions?  It will be important to ascertain whether these actions are being acted on.  I concur with the statement in the report that all of the indications show that they are being acted on, because all of us will be conscious of the significant improvement that has been made across the board.  This is indicative of a willingness on the part of centre managers to ensure actions are taken. <\/p><p>  The number of beds available is not sufficient to meet needs.  I note that HIQA is anxious to facilitate the swift introduction of high-quality beds to the system.  This report details that the agency has granted 21 new registrations in 2013.  I understand the figure from the report shows there are slightly fewer than 29,000 beds across the system.  While this may not be within its remit, has HIQA carried out an assessment to quantify need?  In my limited exposure to this matter, I am aware of cases in which people have encountered great difficulty and a long wait in accessing nursing home care.  Has HIQA any idea of the optimum position?  Perhaps that is not the correct phrase to employ.  What encouragement can be offered, given the opportunities that are available in this sector?  My home county has only seven such facilities, while County Louth, a neighbouring county, has twice as many, although its population is also much greater.  When one examines the profile of the State one finds that some areas have much greater provision, although their populations are much greater.  There is certainly scope for the introduction of further facilities or the extension of current facilities, as I have no doubt there is a need.  Can the witnesses add anything to their disposition to facilitating the swift introduction of high-quality beds?  Does HIQA engage in proactive encouragement of the centres it visits?  Is there a focus on extending provision?  Even if that is not to be the case, I ask the witnesses to comment. <\/p><p>  Will Mr. Quinn to elaborate on the need for what is described in the report as \"timely engagement with residents to plan future health events and end-of-life care preferences\".  What is being proposed in this context?<\/p><p>  Again, I thank both witnesses for appearing and commend HIQA on its continuing work.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500005#D00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of Oran &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and thank him for attending to see his party's spokesperson on health in Cavan-Monaghan speaking on his behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500005#D00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>To clarify, he is not an apprentice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500005#D00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>We hope he will follow his father's footsteps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500005#D00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1401958200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from HIQA and thank them for their presentation and report.

In particular, I refer to one in my area, Cherry Orchard, which is run by the HSE and which provides excellent care.  I get many requests from families to have their loved ones put there in long-term care.  Some parts of the hospital, although not dilapidated, could do with a general uplift.  Sometimes that can put people off when they go to visit these places, particularly if they are going to put a family member in long-term care.  I do not know what can be done through HIQA or through the HSE, but the standard of care is excellent.  People are happy with the service, but the appearance of some of the wards can be a little off-putting because they date from when there were large dormitories with many beds.  Although they probably cannot do anything about it, I would be interested in their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500005#D00700","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401958800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome both Mr. Quinn and Mr. Whelan and apologise for my late arrival.

It is in train.  I am less clear on the timespan within which that will be achieved, but the board is keen to ensure there is a replacement substantive CEO as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  There are a number of key issues around the outcome of our inspections.  Mention was made of safe care and support.  What we can do here is look at safe care and support in relation to a number of the members' questions, specifically the questions on the safeguarding of vulnerable adults.  There is a statutory notification process.  We are required to receive that notification.  In a perverse way, the increased notification of safeguarding issues, whether they are alleged, suspected or confirmed, to us is a good development because it indicates that there is at least an open culture for reporting of those events.  However, the number is disturbing when one brings that back down to human level.  The key issue here is for us to try to work together to effect improvements within the services.<\/p><p>  I was asked whether we can detect improvements.  In this instance, we follow up on all actions.  The first line by which we follow up is that we require an action plan from every provider on the publication of a report.  That action plan is assessed for its adequacy by our inspectors and if there are any inadequacies in a particular action, we go back quickly to the provider to seek further clarification or better actions in respect of those requirements made by ourselves.  At times, a follow-up inspection will also be required to ensure that what they have told us is happening on the ground.  One will see that there are always more inspections than there are centres.  Over the course of the next number of years one will see that number increase.  At times, that is linked to the concept of announced and unannounced inspection, because one of the triggers for an unannounced inspection is the need to clarify, for example, whether a specific action that has been claimed has in fact been carried out.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway asked about the issue of safeguarding and its equivalence to some extent with the concept of child protection and welfare.  I suppose that is one of the reasons we introduced into this briefing to the committee the concept of wanting to move towards parallel legislation and a parallel national policy that enables such a co-ordinated and multi-agency approach to the concept of the protection of vulnerable adults.  At times, as a regulator, we will go in and detect issues that point us in the direction of a series of types of vulnerable adult abuse.  That can be physical, it can be neglect, it can be sexual, it can be financial, or it can be verbal.  All of those issues of abuse need to be recognised, first and foremost, by those working within the sector, but we also need to have a singular and co-ordinated approach to ensure that allegations of abuse are appropriately investigated.  They will be investigated at local level, but they may need to be escalated to another agency and on occasion may require the co-operation of the Garda if the abuse points to some sort of criminal activity.  Current policy does not necessarily do that.  It does not have the protection of vulnerable adults at its heart.  Parallel legislation and a parallel national policy would assist us in our work and would improve the protection of vulnerable adults across the State.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway also asked whether we wait for improvements.  We do as I said.  We follow-up with the action plan on an administrative basis and then on the ground.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the introduction of new beds.  In that regard, one of the questions is whether we have a view on the number of beds within the system.<\/p> <p>In our last appearance before the committee I remember Dr. Tracey Cooper talking about the demographic time bomb, to which I have referred in the foreword to the report.  The numbers of people aged over 65 years and 85 years in the country are increasing at quite a rate, in some instances at a higher rate than that for our European neighbours.  There is a balance to be struck in the nature of care provided within the community.  Government policy points us in the direction of providing more care within the community, but it is not always necessarily about residential care.  There is absolutely a place for residential care.  However, we also need to look at alternatives such as supported living, as well as providing care in a person's own home.  We must ensure the care provided in a person's own home is also of a high quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401959400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinn referred to a demographic time bomb.

The residential sector is playing an important part in addressing some of the issues involved, in particular end-of-life care issues.  For individuals in nursing homes there tends to be a requirement for 24 hour, seven days a week, nursing care.  From that perspective, we need to address the various levels of dependency and age profiles across the population.<\/p><p>  We tend not to comment on the number of beds within the sector but rather the quality of the operation.  However, if we are asked to ensure the facilitation of the entry of new beds into the system, we will do so, as I have outlined.<\/p><p>  As I said in the report, there is a place both for announced and unannounced visits.  In large part, public confidence calls for increased numbers of unannounced inspections.  There is greater public confidence in the concept of unannounced inspections.  In these instances, it is about inspectors trying to see services as they are delivered on a day-to-day basis, or, if we have received some unsolicited information, validating a risk.  For example, it may be about providing care in the evening with reduced nursing and care staff on the floor.  We check this, but there is no point in doing so on an announced basis.<\/p><p>  The number of announced inspections we have undertaken this year has, to some extent, been based on the introduction of the thematic programme.  The programme is about promoting improvement in the sector, for which we provide information by way of guidance to point them in the direction of best practice.  We then follow through on their self-assessment to ascertain how they are achieving the relevant standards and regulations.  The announced inspections are about ensuring an improvement in services and working with the sector to achieve that improvement.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked me about the public versus private care issue and whether we treated either category differently.  We register at the level of the designated centre.  Whether public, private or voluntary, the designated centre is regulated in exactly the same way.  We do not treat any sector differently because we are assessing compliance with standards and regulations.  Therefore, we deal with them in exactly the same way.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about environmental standards.  As a regulatory body working alongside care providers, HIQA wants to see progressive realisation of higher standards of care in the environment within which it is provided.  A number of targets were included in the original regulations for the achievement of specific environmental standards in the provision of care.  Last year HIQA issued a regulatory notice which helped to explain better to providers in all sectors how these standards could be met.  The main driver of improved environmental standards is the dignity of, and respect for, residents.  In the regulatory notice we have given advice on how this can be achieved within some of the older buildings.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about the quality of the environment, in terms of the decor.  There is certainly a requirement for providers to maintain a good standard in this regard.  For however long someone is there, it is his or her own home.  We believe his or her quality of life is influenced by the quality of the environment.  Therefore, we have significant standards to be achieved in updating the environment where required.<\/p><p>  Deputy Robert Dowds asked about activities within homes.  This is a key issue that probably needs a further follow-up concerning the quality of such activities engaged in, including those which are therapeutic, in particular homes.  In this and subsequent years we want to focus in our thematic work on areas in which a significant improvement is needed.  They include not just areas that involve a high risk but also areas in which activities can be engaged in to enhance the quality of the residents' lives in homes.  That is challenging within the residential sector. <\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the independence of residents.  On the person-centred theme, there must be a requirement to address the independence of residents in nursing homes in order that they can go out and engage in social activities in the community.  This should be facilitated as part of the person-centred theme in the provision of care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1401959400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>To what extent can HIQA exert pressure on homes to do something about this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500007#F00400","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401959400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We can.  We need to address the issue through the provision of better guidance for homes on what is a good standard to be achieved in engaging in additional activities to promote independence as part of the person-centred theme.  I refer the Deputy to point 5.4.2 in the report which examines the standard for the particular element he described.<\/p><p>  Enforcement steps were referred to in the questioning.  In 2013 HIQA introduced a new enforcement procedure.  The key issue in enforcement is to ensure we identify where there is a significant risk to the safety or welfare of residents, to which we must take a proportionate approach.  I have mentioned that residential centres are home to a number of individuals.  Therefore, it would be best if we could maintain some level of stability in such centres.  In the first instance, our aim is to identify problems as early as possible in order that we can address them with the provider.  However, if there is persistent non-compliance and a refusal to work with the concept of our action plans, we will escalate our enforcement activity.<\/p><p>  End-of-life care is another theme that emerged from the questions.  I have referred to the age, morbidity, illness or dependency profiles of residents in the nursing home sector.  One of the key issues in anyone being cared for in a nursing home who is in his or her final months or years of life is to engage with him or her and his or her relatives on how they would like him or her to be cared for.  In some instances, we hear how people at the end of their lives are placed in an ambulance, transported to an accident and emergency department and kept on a trolley.  In fact, advanced care planning could enable an expression of a person's wish to be cared for within the nursing home with the support of primary care services in the community.<\/p> <p>We place a significant importance on how we engage with people at an early stage with regard to assessing their wishes about how they will be cared for.  Those are the main focuses we have on end-of-life care, as well as the links and liaisons the nursing home has with the primary carer about a holistic approach to a person's care as the person approaches the end of his or her life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014060500007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401960000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Section 4.5 of the report mentions unsolicited information and figure 8 gives the sources of this information, which come from a wide variety of people from whistleblowers to residents.
