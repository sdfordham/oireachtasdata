If the alternative (a worsening of the basic schedule) had been done then any impact survey conducted would have shown greater impact in all other curricular areas identified in this survey other than guidance. The bottom line is the budget measure allowed schools deal with the reduction on an individual basis according to their own judgement of what was best.<\/p><p>  I have already acknowledged to the House and indeed previously to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors that bringing guidance provision within quota is challenging for schools.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools. The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.<\/p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.<\/p><p>  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  There has been no reduction in the number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) available to schools this year, with 10,575 posts remaining available for allocation.<\/p><p>  The fact that the number of special needs assistant posts are being maintained at current levels is a reflection of this Governments commitment to prioritising supports for children with special educational needs, at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.<\/p><p>  All children who have qualified for such support this year have been provided with access to SNA support. Notwithstanding the fact that there is potential for demographic growth in the pupil population over the coming years, there has been no indication to date that there are insufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all children with special educational needs who qualify for SNA support.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the total number of posts which are available for allocation, which is 10,575 posts, remains significantly greater than the number which were allocated to schools in recent years, for example, 10,342 posts at the end of 2009 and 10,442 posts at the end of 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200055#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Literacy Levels","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200055#WRC03813"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[2682\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200055#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the date on which the findings of a reassessment into the amount of time that is allocated to subjects in the Irish curriculum are to be published; his views on the disappointing results obtained by students in mathematics and science compared with other EU countries that has been attributed to the time that is spent studying those subjects","asker":"1102","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>In December 2012 the most recent international results were published.

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person&#8217;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.  The Passport Service must operate within the law on this as in all matters.  The Department received an application from the parents of the child in question last August.  As she was born in Dublin on 4 May 2012<font color=\"#004080\">,<\/font>her entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font> The Act provide<font color=\"#004080\">s<\/font> that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&#8217;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>person&#8217;s birth.<\/p><p><br \/>  Moreover, the Act makes particular provision for nationals of EU member states, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years preceding their children&#8217;s birth.  In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the Act, unless the contrary is proved.  These declarations must be supported by documentary evidence (e.g. tax documents, bank statements, social welfare benefit payments, work permits, rent leases etc) to verify actual residence in the State. <\/p><p><br \/>  In this case, the applicant&#8217;s parents are Romanian citizens.  Romania entered the EU on 1 January, 2007.  While parents from that country (and Bulgaria) are equal to other EU nationals in terms of free movement and residence, there were restrictions in terms of access to the labour market.  <\/p><p><br \/>  At the time of application last August, the Department had undertaken a review of the kind of evidence, such as work permits, that may be required to establish lawful and reckonable residence for Romanian and Bulgarian parents.  The Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, provided detailed advice on this last November.  This enabled the Passport Service to finalise last month guidelines in this area.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Work has been ongoing since then to clear the small number of applications which were delayed as a result of this review.  This person&#8217;s application was among them.

At its meeting on 22 and 23 November 2012, the European Council gave a mandate to President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to pursue work on the MFF, with a view to reaching agreement at the beginning of 2013.  President Van Rompuy now hopes to close negotiations at the meeting of the European Council on 7 and 8 February.  The Irish Presidency will support President Van Rompuy in his efforts to secure a deal on the MFF. <\/p><p>  The EU and its member states are collectively the largest provider of development assistance in the world, providing over 55% of global ODA.  This will remain the case under the next MFF.  The strength of the development budget enables the EU to implement large scale projects and to respond effectively to humanitarian crises when they emerge.  It also confers great legitimacy on the Union when it calls on all international donors, including new and emerging partners, to raise their level of ambition and to increase their ODA efforts to a level similar to the EU, thus contributing their fair share to the global development efforts. <\/p><p>  In the course of the MFF negotiations, we have sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget is allocated to development assistance.  We have pointed out that this will allow the EU to continue playing a leadership role, to engage effectively when humanitarian crises emerge and to target extreme poverty and hunger.  Given the financial constraints across the EU there has been pressure from member states to seek reductions across every heading of the MFF.

In that regard, there is no application process to Revenue or otherwise. A transfer can take place once it complies with the requirements of the Regulations and the rules without prior Revenue approval. Under the Regulations, in the case of occupational pension schemes, the facility to transfer only applies to a scheme member who is entitled under the Pensions Act 1990 to &ldquo;preserved benefits&rdquo; under the scheme - in other words to a scheme member whose service in the relevant employment has terminated  .<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is the responsibility of all trustees to ensure full compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. In essence, the Regulations require that, prior to making any overseas transfer payments, the trustees and PRSA providers must be satisfied that:<\/p><p>  (a)  The member has requested a transfer.<\/p><p>  (b) The overseas arrangement provides relevant benefits as defined by section 770 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.<\/p><p>  (c) The overseas arrangement has been approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in the country concerned. <\/p><p>  In practice, trustees and PRSA providers are required to obtain written confirmation to that effect from the trustees, custodians, managers or administrators of the overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that if the transfer is to another EU Member State, Revenue rules require the overseas scheme to be operated or managed by an Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS), within the meaning of the EU Pensions Directive (known as the &ldquo;IORPS Directive&rdquo;), and to be established in a Member State of the European Communities which has implemented the IORPS Directive in its national law. The scheme administrator must also be resident in an EU Member State. In broad terms, the purpose of the IORPS Directive is to ensure that members and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes are properly informed about the rules and financial position of the scheme and their rights under the scheme, and to ensure the efficient management and investment of scheme assets.<\/p><p>  If the transfer is to a country outside the EU, under Revenue rules a transfer may not be made to a country other than the one in which the member is currently employed.<\/p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in recent years two additional approval conditions have been introduced for all existing and new retirement benefit schemes and PRSAs in relation to overseas transfers. In late 2009, a condition was introduced to the effect that all overseas transfers under the provisions of the above mentioned Regulations may be made to facilitate bona fide transfers only, that is that they are not made with the primary purpose of circumventing Irish tax requirements. Early last year, in response to an apparent increase in requests to pension fund trustees and administrators for transfers of Irish pension funds abroad following newspaper advertisements encouraging such actions in order, for example, to access tax-free cash early, a further condition was introduced requiring a member of an occupational pension scheme or a PRSA contributor who directs the trustees of the scheme or the PRSA provider to make a transfer to an overseas scheme, to sign a declaration to the effect that the transfer conforms to the requirements of the Regulations and Revenue pension rules, is for bona fide reasons and is not primarily for the purpose of circumventing pension tax legislation and Revenue rules. <\/p><p>  Moving pension funds abroad in an effort to frustrate Irish tax rules would fall foul of these approval conditions and could ultimately result in approval being withdrawn which would have very significant consequences for any individual concerned.<\/p><p>  Tax relief given on pension savings is intended to encourage individuals to save for the long-term with a view to providing them with an income in retirement. That is why our tax rules, like those in many other jurisdictions, set a minimum age from which benefits from pension savings can normally be accessed. It is important that these rules are not abused and that savings built up with the benefit of generous tax reliefs are not misused. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Bonds","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[2292\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there has been any consideration of issuing sovereign debt bonds under non-domestic law such as in New York or the UK; and if future Irish Government Bonds issued this year will include collective action clauses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that euro area countries issue their bonds under domestic law and this is the market standard for direct issuance.

I believe that transparency is to be welcomed.  If people are better informed then they will better understand the need for current levels of taxation. It will also serve to enhance public knowledge of the extent of spending on our vast range of public services and, indeed, provide an increased understanding of their cost.<\/p><p>  The Local Property Tax will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, they do not issue statements to the vast majority of taxpayers and as part of their modernisation programme they are actively working to reduce the incidence of such statements.  The core mission of the Revenue Commissioners is the collection of taxes and duties, and the implementation of customs controls.   It has no function in decisions relating to the allocation or expenditure of Government funds arising from taxes received.  The proceeds of the Local Property Tax will accrue to local authorities and will support the provision of local services.  How this will be spent will vary from local authority to local authority and this information will not be readily available to Revenue.  Any requirement on Revenue to gather, analyse and provide details of how taxes were spent would be adding the burden of a non-core function on an already fully engaged office and could prove to be a drain on limited resources.  Decisions about the allocation of resources for local services would primarily be matters for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and for the local authorities themselves.<\/p><p>  Turning to the question of distributing statements, the most obvious and efficient mechanism to distribute any proposed statements to individuals is by way of an electronic interface.  However, in order to protect taxpayer confidentiality, any electronic system containing taxpayer information and data must be properly secured and accessible only through secure passwords and other protections.  Although Revenue has a number of online systems, they are designed for the declaration and collection of tax. They would require extensive and expensive development to reconfigure for use in the distribution of the data outlined in this parliamentary question.<\/p><p>  Not all taxpayers have, or indeed want, access to Revenue's online facilities.  Accordingly, in these cases, Revenue will be obliged to print and then post the data and information to individual taxpayers. The operational costs involved in this can be significant.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, Revenue has found that in the past the distribution of unsolicited information has sometimes surprised many taxpayers and caused needless concern.  This gave rise to substantial increases in phone calls, letters and personal callers to Revenue offices.  These, often simple information or explanatory enquiries, resulted in the diversion of experienced staff away from essential tax compliance related functions. <\/p><p>  Taxpayers should be as well-informed as possible about where their money goes.  It is appropriate also that they should have confidence that their money is used wisely, by a Government which focuses on efficiency and effectiveness.  Having said that, I am not satisfied that the benefits to be derived from implementing a system of issuing every household who pays Local Property Tax with an annual receipt outlining the way the tax was spent would outweigh the costs and administrative burden involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Staff","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03125"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[2899\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of immediate or extended family members employed by his Department; the names and remuneration in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>No family members and or related party members are employed in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Product Classification","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03325"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[2924\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200058#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a company (details supplied) in County Cavan that has applied for a 2205 classification cannot be facilitated in obtaining this, in view of the fact that the jobs of 12 people are at stake here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"971","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are examining the classification of an alcoholic product presented by the company in question and have sought the assistance of the State Laboratory as part of this process.

The roll-out of the approved process now provides an opportunity to meet the commitment set out in the Programme for Government to &quot;explore the establishment of a multi-campus Technical University in the South East&quot;.  In relation to the evolutionary pathway laid out in the National Strategy for institutes of technology, the implementation process is well under way.  The Landscape document published in February 2012 lays out a clear four stage process and criteria for institutes of technology who wish to apply for designation as a technological university.   The process for designation is designed to ensure educational quality, objectivity, international expertise, fairness and transparency.   The process will consist of four stages overseen by HEA, with an independent international panel of experts to advise the Authority in the final stages.  The first stage requires institutes of technology to submit a formal expression of interest in merging and seeking designation.  I understand from HEA that three such expressions of interest have been received.  One of these is a proposal that Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology to seek designation.  The Higher Education Authority is considering all proposals and its advice on system configuration in March 2013 will include advice on the progress of institutes of technology interested in seeking designation to the second stage of the designation process.

Following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme, a five year multi-annual envelope for 2012 to 2016 was set in November 2011; this was slightly adjusted in Budget 2013 to address pressures relating to contractual commitments, drawdown of EU funding, replacement of Garda vehicles and to allow for the progression of a new children's detention facility at Oberstown. In deciding on the capital allocations, the Government gave strong consideration to the employment impact of the investment and on the economic and social infrastructure needs.<\/p><p>  There will, of course, be direct employment benefits in the delivery of the infrastructure proposed in the Investment Framework and most importantly from the contribution that this capital investment makes to providing the capacity for the economy to grow. In this context, supports to the enterprise sector through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA were protected in the review of the Public Capital Programme. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies helps to foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. My Department had a central role in conducting the Capital Review and in developing the multi-annual investment framework.<\/p><p>  The Government decides on annual allocations taking account of the overall budgetary position, strategic investment needs and the benefits that will flow from investment, including employment. Each spending Department then considers the expected cash requirements for each of its projects and constructs its profile of how much cash it will need to draw down each month from its allocation for the year. These monthly profiles are published for each Department.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure. In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed. The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year. For these reasons it is not appropriate for employment and job creation to be factored into the administrative exercise of profiling monthly cash drawdown requirements from annual capital allocations, although these factors are, of course, critical in formulating Government decisions on the capital budgetary allocations in the first place.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200063#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":476,"content":"<p>Question No. 302 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Properties","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM00275"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[3033\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the relocation of staff from Convent Road, Roscommon to Golf Links Road, Roscommon will be completed by the Office of Public Works; his plans for the occupation of the vacant space on the Convent Road; his plans for the occupation of the vacant space on the Golf Links Road; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>The relocation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s staff from Convent Road to Golf Links Road in Roscommon Town will be complete by early February 2013, following which this building will be practically fully occupied.

The headline Europe 2020 target is focused on employed persons aged 20 to 64 as a percentage of the population aged 20 to 64. Member States may set their own national targets in the light of the headline Europe 2020 target taking into account their relative starting positions and national circumstances and draw up national reform programmes setting out the actions they aim to undertake in order to implement the strategy.<\/p><p><br \/>  As noted in the Social Justice Ireland report &quot;<i>Ireland and the Europe 2020 Strategy,&quot; <\/i>Ireland&#8217;s National Reform Programme 2011 set an employment rate target range for Ireland of 69%-71% for 2020.  The NRP also stated that the target level of ambition would be reviewed in 2014 in the context of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  Ireland&#8217;s employment rate for 20-64yrs rose from 66.4% in 1998 to a peak of 73.8% in 2007.  This growth was underpinned by rapid increases in employment, particularly in sectors such as construction, financial services, health and education, and was assisted by long term positive increases in educational attainment and higher female participation.  Moreover, this increase in the employment rate occurred while the 20-64 years population was itself growing rapidly &#8211; from 2.12 million in 1998 to 2.74 million on 2007.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland&#8217;s employment rate 20-64yrs averaged 63.8% in 2011.  The rate at Q3 2012 was also 63.8%.  The main factors underpinning the decline since 2007 are the decrease in the construction sector, agriculture, industry (traditional manufacturing) and locally traded services.  In contrast to the period of strong labour market performance up to mid-2008, labour markets throughout the EU experienced a sharp setback in 2009.  After several years of relatively strong labour market performance, the economic crisis led to a sudden reversal of employment growth which threatened to sweep away much of the success of previous years.  Labour market performance worsened across all Member States, but most notably in the Baltic States, Ireland and Spain.  Most Member States have since recorded an employment level below that of four years ago.  The EU Employment Guidelines and the EU employment targets, which are non-binding, have remained unchanged since 2010 and the European Council has declined to make small changes in the targets in order to 'engineer' or 'fine-tune' them given the high degree of uncertainty in labour market projections.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Action Plan for Jobs is the Government&#8217;s main policy response to supporting job creation.  The Action Plan is a multi-annual process that commenced in 2012, with 270 specific commitments across all Government Departments and 36 agencies that will help to support jobs growth.<\/p><p><br \/>  In spite of a very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&#8217;s policies.  2012 saw significant net job creation by EI and IDA-supported companies, building on the positive results of 2011 and following successive years of significant net job losses.   In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, for example Tourism Agri-food, ICT and Digital Gaming.  I am currently coordinating the preparation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and this Plan will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM02250"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[2470\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will detail the amounts of regional aid that can be applied for in the South East Region and if they are less than those in regions with lower levels of unemployment.","asker":"1091","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>The maximum aid rates for the South East NUTS 3 Sub Region are 10% for large companies, and 20% and 30% for medium and small firms respectively.

The aid intensity thresholds for each category of region are predetermined in the Guidelines by the Commission.

During 2012, with IDA&rsquo;s support, a number of companies made significant investments in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  Paypal announced 1,000 jobs in Dundalk, Abbott announced 175 jobs in Sligo, Mylan announced 200 jobs in Galway, Allergan announced 200 jobs in Westport and Northern Trust announced 400 jobs in Limerick.  Last week Visticon announced that it was investing over &euro;100million in the expansion of its manufacturing operations in Limerick with the creation of 100 new highly skilled manufacturing jobs and 200 temporary construction jobs. All of these announcements augur well for regional economic development throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to attract FDI to Ireland, it recognises that leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure in addition to the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Accordingly, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  During 2012, as part of its marketing activities, IDA Ireland began an online marketing initiative, &ldquo;Connect &amp; Invest&rdquo;, to showcase the unique attributes of each region to international clients.  In addition, IDA also promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.<\/p><p>  A key component of a Gateway Economic Region&rsquo;s value proposition are the existing industry clusters which originated with the arrival of several large multinational companies through the support of IDA Ireland and which, in turn, create the development of an indigenous sub-supply base assisted, in some cases, by Enterprise Ireland.  A number of these Irish-owned companies, particularly in the Life Sciences Sector, have since become significant international players in their own right.  These clusters are primarily located in Gateway locations.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has also explained that, typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements.  In certain cases other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis.  In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland also endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures\/job losses.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the client company based on its business requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM02950"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[2534\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200064#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to set up a hardship fund to help small and medium businesses survive current economic difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>Government actions to support the development of Irish business in the current economic climate have been set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and are targeted in a manner to address real business difficulties.

Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.

The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.<\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.

Employers who pay statutory redundancy payments to their employees are entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State if the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy is before 1 January 2013.  <\/p><p>  In Budget 2012 I reduced the level of the rebate from 60% to 15% and in Budget 2013 the Government decided to remove the redundancy rebate to employers in respect of redundancies where the date of dismissal is on or after 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>  Where an employer can prove that he\/she cannot afford to pay a statutory redundancy payment, the State makes a lump sum payment directly to the individual and a debt is raised against the employer which the State will endeavour to recover.

The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.<\/p><p>  The taxation of oil products is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>  The upward trend in global oil prices arises primarily from the increases in the international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from a low of US$90 in June 2012 to US$111 in January 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail oil prices.<\/p><p>  Against this background my focus, and that of the Government, is on interventions that can assist in mitigating to some degree, increases in energy prices. <\/p><p>  At a general policy level this involves measures to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy resources in the areas of electricity and transport.<\/p><p>  I am very aware that many households are experiencing financial hardship due to the current economic difficulties.  As such, the Government is taking a range of actions to address the challenge of affordable energy for vulnerable households.  Over the last ten years &euro;2 billion has been distributed in energy supports under the National Fuel Scheme and the Household Benefits Package administered by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  In addition, &euro;100 million has been spent, from my own Department&rsquo;s Vote, on energy efficiency improvements in vulnerable homes.  Permanent improvements to the thermal efficiency of houses are the most cost-effective means of addressing energy poverty.<\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers on behalf of my Department, the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, which is free-of-charge to eligible applicants.  With over 93,000 homes refurbished to date, 2013 will see approximately 10,000 low-income households benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.  I have allocated approximately &euro;20 million to the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2013.<\/p><p>  More generally, the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland was launched by me in November 2011.  The Strategy sets out our plans for enhancing the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The strategy includes 48 actions that will be implemented over the life of the Strategy.<\/p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy has established subgroups to work on particular dimensions of the Strategy.  These include the implementation of revised eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme and a pilot programme to assess the feasibility of an area-based approach to delivery of the Scheme.<\/p><p>  In the area of transport the development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable electricity generation by 2020.  The Government has introduced a grant scheme for electric vehicles to provide an incentive to encourage their uptake.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.<\/p><p>  The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 6.38% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The Scheme ensured that 144.5 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market in 2011.  The Better Energy programme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, as well as bringing on board energy suppliers as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers.<\/p><p>  Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[2589\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the steps he is taking to reduce domestic energy bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":788,"content":"<p>I have no statutory function in the setting of gas or electricity prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of these markets.  Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies operating in the retail market.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.<\/p><p><br \/>  In making its decision, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers.  In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher energy prices on residential and commercial consumers.  It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas.  My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.<\/p><p><br \/>  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.<\/p><p>Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental\/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department&#8217;s commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the lifetime of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home; the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation; ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures; reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes; and the introduction of an area based approach.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency based measures delivered through the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000 and has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.  The Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  Better Energy Warmer Homes has been allocated &#8364;20 million for this purpose.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are also a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising electricity prices, and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can and should shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, and switch supplier if necessary bearing in mind that all suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings including availing of Government funded measures as already referred to above.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Staff","counter":789,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS01325"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[2895\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of immediate or extended family members employed by his Department; the names and remuneration in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":791,"content":"<p>I do not employ any family members.

In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.<\/p><p>  The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland&rsquo;s fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by a number of private service providers over various platforms including wired, fixed wireless and mobile technologies.<\/p><p>  The Government can intervene in the case of clear market failure.  It has, in the past, undertaken, following EU State aid clearance, a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  State investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are examples of such interventions.  In Counties Longford and Westmeath, broadband services under the NBS are available in 11 and 26 Electoral Divisions respectively.<\/p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: <\/p><p>-   70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>-   At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>-   A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the commitments in the National Broadband Plan will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country, including Counties Longford and Westmeath.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.<\/p><p>  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which may require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Counties Longford and Westmeath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[3044\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the financial amount which accrued to the State in 2012 from the royalties associated with the exploration and development of natural energy sources such as oil and gas in Irish territorial waters.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[3045\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the way the royalties which accrue to the State from the operation of energy exploration licences are calculated; when this system was established; and his plans to review same.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[3046\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200070#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the financial amounts, in monetary amount and also as a percentage of the overall revenue generated from the exploration fields, that accrued to the State in each year of the past 20 years from royalties earned from the licences granted to develop offshore energy sources in Irish territorial waters.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>I propose to take Question Nos. 426 to 428, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>There have been only four commercial petroleum discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s.

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.<\/p><p>In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State from petroleum production, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.

My Department has provided over &euro;700 million to support the Ballymun regeneration programme to date.  This has facilitated the demolition of all but one of the towers and nearly all the flat blocks as well as the construction of over 2,900 social, voluntary, private and affordable residential units, new local parks and playgrounds, neighbourhood centres and a new traditional style main street.  The programme has also provided state of the art community facilities, such as the Axis theatre, the Leisure Centre and Civic Centre.  The Ballymun regeneration project has now moved into the completion phase and my Department&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the remaining housing need is met while the investment provided to date is fully protected.  All demolition and construction projects are expected to be substantially completed by end 2014.<\/p><p>  In 2012, my Department committed to providing some &euro;51 million over the period 2012 &ndash; 2014 to ensure that outstanding housing need in Ballymun would be met in full and that infrastructure projects needed to protect the substantial investment in regeneration to date would be provided.  In 2012 funding of &euro;30 million was provided to BRL to meet the costs of construction and demolition projects underway, ongoing social regeneration programme costs and the BRL administrative overhead.  The 2012 outturn represented an increase of 20% on the initial 2012 allocation and demonstrates my ongoing commitment to supporting this important project.  In August 2012 my Department issued approval in principle to Ballymun Regeneration Ltd (BRL) for the inclusion of a number of sites in Ballymun as part of an overall site reinstatement strategy and sought further information in relation to a number of additional sites.  The overall objective is to protect the investment to date and concentrate on at-risk open spaces and areas which have the potential to become the focus of anti-social behaviour. A submission in this regard has recently been received from BRL and is currently under examination in my Department.  In October 2012, my Department approved BRL&rsquo;s tender   recommendation for Demolition Contract 8, which provides for the demolition of the flat complexes on Shangan Road and Sillogue Road.  It is now a matter for BRL to progress this contract.  I understand, however, that the demolition of these units will be completed towards the middle of this year.<\/p><p>  In terms of the consultation and communications process, given that this project is now moving towards completion, the emphasis has changed from the initial strategic level consultation with stakeholders, local community groups and residents associations in relation to the development and implementation of the regeneration masterplan to the local level of one-to-one engagement with residents in relation to relocation.  Consultation and communication on matters relating to regeneration policy and practice is also facilitated by having local community and public representatives on the Board of BRL.  BRL&rsquo;s offices are located at the Civic Centre on Main Street and are open to the public from Monday to Friday between the hours of 9.00 and 17.00. BRL have a dedicated Communications Team available at their offices to deal with telephone and email queries and also to deal with queries and complaints from members of the public in relation to any matter within its remit.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the constraints on capital expenditure across the public sector, my Department will continue to support the National Regeneration Programme, including the completion strategy for Ballymun.  I intend to announce details of the capital allocations for 2013 as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200071#WRT02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":860,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 448 and 449 answered with Question No. 438.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":861,"content":"<p>Question No. 450 answered with Question No. 444.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Purchase Schemes","counter":862,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":863,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[2590\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the steps he is taking to support home ownership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":864,"content":"<p>The Government&#8217;s housing policy statement published in June 2011 marked a radical departure for housing in Ireland. The statement clearly recognises the economic consequences of an over reliance on the property sector. It signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective, and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership. The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market.  The policy statement reaffirms the State's commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership will remain in place in that regard. Two types of house purchase loan are available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221;. <\/p><p><br \/>  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department's website: <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is also committed to supporting local authority mortgage holders experiencing arrears difficulties, particularly through the updated guidance issued to local authorities in July 2012. This guidance will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment of options for households in difficulties. <\/p><p><br \/>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will closely mirror the suite of options available in the commercial sector. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers, and ensure that, where possible, households will be facilitated to continue to live in their own homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[2639\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that investigation of possible governance issues in Mayo North East LEADER Partnership Teo has concluded; the action he intends to take arising out of the findings and recommendations of the report from the investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":867,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[2880\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the findings and recommendations made arising out of the investigation of possible governance issues in Mayo North East Leader Partnership Teo and the irregularities if any that were found; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":868,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 458 together.<\/p><p>   Mayo North East Leader Partnership   (MNELP) is the Local Action Group contracted by my Department to deliver both the Rural Development Programme (RDP) and the Local Community Development Programme (LCDP) to the North Mayo area.

However, it should also be noted that the issuing of payments to eligible approved applications is progressing as normal.   <\/p><p>  The Final Report, which has recently been made available to me, has been provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) (Managing Authority for the RDP) which has subsequently reported the findings to the European Commission and the external accreditation auditors (Deloitte). The findings of the investigation have also been reported to both the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Standards in Public Office Commission and consideration of these findings will be subject to the relevant processes in these bodies. The Report is also under consideration in my own Department.  It is critical that the funds delivered through the LEADER elements of the RDP are managed in an efficient and effective way , and the suspension of project approvals in MNELP will remain in place until I am satisfied that such approvals can  proceed. <\/p><p>  While we must ensure correct and proper management and implementation of the LEADER elements of the RDP from both a regulatory and value for money perspective, my Department's objective is to conclude the processes associated with this investigation with a view to reinstating access to RDP funds to the citizens of Mayo North East at the earliest possible opportunity, while ensuring regulatory compliance, value for money and maximum impact for the people of North Mayo. On foot of recent meetings with DAFM, my Department is currently developing an Action Plan that will provide the necessary assurances in these regards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":870,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[2640\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total amount of rural development funds pursuant to the current round of LEADER funding that was ring fenced to be distributed by Mayo North East Leader Partnership Teo; the amount of the said funding that has been drawn down to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":871,"content":"<p>Mayo North East Leader Partnership (MNELP) is the Local Action Group contracted by my Department to deliver both the Rural Development Programme (RDP) and the Local Community Development Programme (LCDP) to the North Mayo area. MNELP were originally allocated &euro;10,751,894.00 for the delivery of Axis 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 in the Mayo North East area. Implementation of the LEADER elements of the RDP commenced in 2009 and to 31 December 2012 MNELP has registered overall expenditure of &euro;4,388,947.92 which includes both project and administration expenditure. <\/p><p>  On the 31 December 2012, MNELP also had overall project activity of &euro;5,764,242.40 which includes project pipeline activity or projects at the early stages of development. Full contractual commitments in MNELP amounted to &euro;4,728,325.24, inclusive of expenditure.  In  late 2011 the European Commission approved a change in co-funding rates from 55% to 85% for Rural Development Programmes for countries that were part of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. Prior to this RDP measures were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national exchequer sources. <\/p><p>  The 2011 agreement reduces the national exchequer input to 15% for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This has resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to &euro;314m. <\/p><p>In this context the original funding allocations given to each Local Development Company contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP are no longer definitive and depend on the capacity of both the groups and their local areas to absorb the available funding within the required timeframes. However, in this context my Department is working closely with Local Development Companies to ensure that any community or individual in any geographical area who is eligible for funding under the RDP will have their applications dealt with in an efficient and effective manner and applications from all geographic areas will be considered equally as long as funding is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Assistance Scheme Funding","counter":872,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01450"},{"type":"question","counter":873,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[2772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200072#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if, in view of the congregate settings and New Directions report, he intends to make funding available in 2013 to agencies (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":874,"content":"<p>Under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. <\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects.

There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.<\/p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.

Robbery is down (by 5.9%) but burglary is up 7.9% and fraud offences up by 6.2%.  While the overall category of theft offences are down by 1.2% there is a worrying increase in the level of theft from the person and this is continuing to receive attention through targeted Garda operations.  While the burglary figures reflect a twelve month trend seen earlier in 2012, the rate of increase has reduced from 10.3% to 7.9% and the figures for the most recent quarter reflect the impact Operation Fiacla is having, when compared to periods prior to its introduction.  As can be seen from the 3,538 persons arrested and 1,924 charged under Operation Fiacla in the period form April up to the end of December 2012,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clearly tackling the problem of burglary and the prolific offenders involved head&ndash;on.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200074#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":940,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200074#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":941,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[2436\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200074#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will allocate additional Garda personnel to Operation Stilts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":942,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no direct function in the matter. <\/p><p>  Operation Stilts has been ongoing since 2009 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region North Central Division with the aims and objectives of intensively policing identified areas including O&rsquo;Connell Street, Marlborough Street, Talbot Street, North Earl St, Abbey St, Eden Quay, the Boardwalk, Wolfe Tone Street, Parnell Street and adjacent side streets to prevent and disrupt the activities of persons involved in the commission of anti-social behaviour, drug use or drug dealing offences.  <\/p><p>  In December 2012, Operation Stilts was further intensified by combining the use of uniform high-visibility personnel and plain clothes personnel.  <\/p><p>  Local Management are satisfied that there is sufficient personnel currently allocated to Operation Stilts to meet the policing needs and focus of the operation.

I expect that the future work of the relevant Working Group of experts in relation to the proposed sanctions regime will be guided by these discussions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":988,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":989,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[2547\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for naturalisation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":990,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in March, 2008.<\/p><p><br \/>   I considered the application in April, 2011 and decided to defer making a final decision in this case for 18 months.

This includes timely and frequent issue of reminders, together with provision of an on-line facility for the payment of fines and general improvement in management of the fines collection process.  The length of time within which a fine can be paid can vary considerably and is determined amongst other things by the discretion of the judge and value of the fine.  Currently if the fine remains outstanding within 6 months of the due payment date, a warrant is issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pursue the outstanding fine. Once a warrant is issued, the Courts Service has no further function in pursuing unpaid fines.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Courts Service has informed me that, under the current system, and taking account of the above, the value of fines outstanding is assessed on a rolling 12 month period.  For the 12 months to the end of December 2012, the total value of fines imposed was &#8364;31.5m (95,500 fines).  The total value of fines collectable after adjusting for appeals and cancellation of warrants by a court was &#8364;17.3m (60,000).  In 2012 a total of &#8364;15.3m was received. While this gives a collection rate of 89% based on value, it should be noted that some of the payments received in 2012 would relate to fines imposed prior to 2012.   At the end of 2011, the average collection rate was 69%. The Courts Service considers that this rate is a truer reflection of the actual collection rate as a number of other factors impacted on the compliance rate for 2012, including a decline in the value and volumes of court fines imposed in 2012 compared with 2011. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, the General Scheme of a Fines (Amendment) Bill has been published with a view to enactment this year if possible.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[2619\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a free legal aid application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that I have no function or responsibility in relation to the matter raised.

In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. (The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 made it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.) Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised. Calls to criminalise the purchase of sex require very careful consideration. While there is already a consensus on the evils of child prostitution and human trafficking for sexual exploitation, I am aware there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. <\/p><p><br \/>  Our legislative approach to prostitution is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation.  For that reason, solicitation in a public place is an offence. The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party - a pimp, for example. It is also an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.   A person found guilty of compelling or coercing a person (which would include a homeless person) to be a prostitute is liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both.    <\/p><p><br \/>  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation, including prostitution. A person found guilty of this offence is liable to life imprisonment. <\/p><p><br \/>  Our legislation on prostitution is currently being reviewed. As part of that review, in June 2012, I published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process.  It sets out four potential legislative models for discussion but does not favour any particular approach. On its publication, I referred the discussion document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and will report back to me when it has completed its work.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, my Department hosted a conference in October to discuss the consultation paper.  The report of the joint committee and the views expressed at the October conference will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. <\/p><p><br \/>  For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.<\/p><p><b>Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<\/p><p><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis.

He has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Visiting Committees will report every two months to the Inspector on any issue that they wish to bring to his attention.  They will be able to report any urgent or major issue to him at any time.

The Courts Service has confirmed that documentation in over 70% of these cases is non-compliant and applications cannot be accepted until the various enquiries have been addressed.

There is a long standing wish of many Travellers that they be granted recognition as an ethnic group but also there are some divergent views within the Traveller community.<\/p><p><br \/>  The previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority. Dialogue between staff of the Department of Justice and Equality and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place in the past on the issue, for example, during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.   In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of the Department of Justice and Equality, earlier last year established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  Arising from the work of this group, among other things, a conference was held in Dublin Castle, supported by the Department of Justice and Equality.  At this conference various aspects of the ethnicity subject were considered from a wide spectrum of opinion.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Travellers in Ireland have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution. The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b><\/b>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.<\/p><p>Consideration of this issue remains ongoing with a view to ensuring that full analysis of  all aspects of the granting of ethnic status to Travellers is available to Government when coming to a decision on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1058,"content":"<p>Question No. 520 answered with Question No. 504.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[3004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the quarterly figures on burglary including car theft in County Meath by town and rural areas for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1061,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.<\/p><p>  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[3005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a visa application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the application to which the Deputy refers is an application for a certificate of naturalisation which was received from the person in question in April 2012.<\/p><p>  The application is at an advanced stage of processing and the applicant will be informed of my decision in due course.<\/p><p>  As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The 84 staff of the Property Registration Authority (PRA) currently located in that accommodation will be re-located before the expiry of the lease.  The Office of Public Works has identified accommodation in the Irish Life Centre, Dublin 1. However, it is unlikely that the proposed location will be sufficient to accommodate all PRA staff currently in the Setanta Centre and some staff will have to be re-located to Chancery Street.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, as indicated in the previous reply, it was decided, following the Government Review on the viability of all decentralisation projects that the PRA should remain in situ in the new premises located at the Golf Links Road, Roscommon.  The building was originally designed to accommodate 230. Given the on-going moratorium on recruitment, redeployment programmes and the ongoing reduction in staff numbers required under the Employment Control Framework (ECF), it is unlikely that the PRA will be in a position to locate the planned number of staff in Roscommon in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p><br \/>  In view of these circumstances, the PRA continues to work with the Office of Public Works to <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">ensure the optimum utilisation of the accommodation by other suitable public sector occupants.

The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister   for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.

He is now taking work forward and is consulting informally before bringing the matter back to the European Council, which I understand is planned for the meeting of 7 and 8 February. As Presidency, we will give whatever assistance we can to President Van Rompuy, who retains responsibility for, and control of, the process. <\/p><p>  As Presidency and nationally, Ireland wants an EU with sufficient funds to carry out its work, and a budget that can support growth and jobs. Agriculture has a particularly important role to play in the maintenance and creation of growth and jobs, so it is vital that a fully funded CAP continues to support the development of the sector. Indeed, the protection of the budget allocation for CAP is Ireland&rsquo;s number one financial priority, given its importance to our national agri-food development strategy and the importance of the sector to our economic recovery. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of it. <\/p><p>  As to whether a deal on CAP reform can be finalised before the end of the Irish Presidency, I believe it can be. However, three things must happen:<\/p><p>- there must be agreement on the MFF early in 2013,<\/p><p>- there must be rapid progress on outstanding technical and political issues,<\/p><p>- all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - need to engage actively in the negotiating process. <\/p><p>  The latter point is particularly important given the tight timescales we are facing, and the need to agree Council and Parliament positions before the trilogue process begins. <\/p><p>  I am optimistic about the prospects for agreement, but I am also keenly aware that we need real determination from all of the protagonists across all three institutions to commit to the process and to do what is necessary if we are to successfully conclude the reform of the CAP.

Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. <\/p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case. However, subject to satisfying eligibility criteria, the producer concerned is free to participate in year two of the Programme, the opening of which I announced last week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1097,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRZ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1098,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[2492\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of agri environment options scheme will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; if the payment is being held up because of a penalty of less than three percent; if so, if the payment could be processed manually because the scheme participant is most anxious to receive payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1099,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;1,050.30 and &euro;3,629.48 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

This generally involved trace or minute amounts of porcine or equine DNA with the exception of one burger in respect of which a high level of equine DNA (29% of meat content) was indicated. While the FSAI has given assurances that no food safety issues arise in this instance there are clearly very significant issues in respect of confidence in the quality of the products concerned and these are being addressed in the Department&#8217;s investigation. Affected product has been withdrawn from the markets by the food business operators involved.<\/p><p><br \/>  Further preliminary results relating to samples taken by the Department on Tuesday 15<sup>th<\/sup> January, from product manufactured in Silvercrest Foods in the period 3<sup>rd<\/sup> to 14<sup>th<\/sup> January, were published on Thursday 17<sup>th<\/sup> January.  These tests indicate the presence of equine DNA in samples of burgers, which were already withdrawn by the company concerned from the market.  Samples of raw ingredients were also tested.  Thirteen samples of finished burgers were tested for the presence of equine DNA.  Nine tested positive for traces of equine DNA and four tested negative.  Seven samples of raw ingredients were tested, one of which, sourced from another Member State, tested positive.  Samples of ingredients in burgers sourced from Irish suppliers tested negative for equine DNA.  My Department informed the company of these further laboratory test results and the company has suspended all production at the plant until it completes its investigation.  These results were fully assessed jointly by Department officials and the FSAI; and arrangements have been made to have the positive samples further analysed with a view to quantifying the percentage of non beef DNA present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The latest results from tests on burgers from Liffey Meats Ltd., published on 21<sup>st<\/sup> January, have shown that there was no presence of horse DNA in the product, which was manufactured between January 10<sup>th<\/sup> and January 16<sup>th<\/sup>.  These results are welcome and support the company&#8217;s claims that it has addressed concerns raised by the FSAI survey findings.  Primary responsibility for both the safety and quality of food placed on the market place lies with food business operators. This is subject to a series of official controls to verify compliance by the food business operators with their food safety management system - these controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>  The Department has permanent veterinary presence at all its export approved slaughtering plants. Controls at standalone processing plants are based on audits and inspections carried out by DAFM staff, based on risk assessment. In addition under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests normally relate to microbiological and chemical standards, focused on food safety and in accordance with EU testing requirements. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production and safety. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s food fraud control activities and these results arose from that control programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Intensive investigations are continuing with a view to identifying the source of the equine DNA in the Silvercrest Foods processing facility.  This includes further analysis of a range of samples from both burgers and ingredients.

This funding has been allocated.  A capital allocation of &#8364;3.25m for childcare facilities is available to my Department in 2013, and I am currently considering how this allocation can best be utilised for the benefit of the childcare sector. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department does however continue to provide support to parents to assist them with the daily cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs. <\/p><p>The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places for trainees and students whose children are enrolled in a participating service and who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC to qualify for childcare support under the programme.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro-rata basis.    <\/p><p><br \/>  The ECCE programme provides one free  preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free preschool provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes was in the region of &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.<\/p><p><br \/>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I and my colleague the Minister for Social Protection announced a joint school-age childcare initiative which will provide further support to both the community and the private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[2399\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding Ethiopian adoptions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1196,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[2793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding inter country adoptions with Belarus and Ethiopia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1197,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 574 together.<\/p><p>All inter country adoptions must meet the requirements of the Adoption Act 2010 including the provisions of the Hague Convention on Inter Country Adoption.<\/p><p>  Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.

Arising out of these proposals, the Government approved the Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The Agency will encompass services which are currently the responsibility of three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. Drafting of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is under way, in line with the policy decisions of Government. This legislation will be published, presented to the Oireachtas and debated at the earliest opportunity. The precise mechanism for this will be determined shortly.  A target date for the establishment of the new Agency will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   <\/p><p>  While the legislative process is under way, all necessary organisational preparations are continuing in parallel.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.

Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  These include SafeTALK which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reaching Out, ASIST, Taking Control, MindOut and STOP.  <\/p><p>A number of media awareness campaigns have been run in recent years including the <i>Let someone know <\/i>campaign which focused specifically on young people and delivered the message that it is important to reach out and seek the support of others.  Other awareness programmes include the <i>The Please Talk <\/i>  initiative, running in third level colleges since 2007, which encourages young people experiencing problems to talk to others and identifies the supports available to those in need.  <\/p><p><i>Jigsaw,<\/i>  an innovative community-based support service for young people, has been developed by Headstrong and is designed to promote systems of care that are accessible, youth-friendly, integrated, and engaging for young people.  Through additional Innovation Funding, this service is now available or in development in 11 sites around the country.  <\/p><p>Schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills have been working closely with the HSE and the NOSP to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention <\/i>  in post-primary schools.    These Guidelines will be launched in the very near future.<\/p><p><br \/>  The special provision of &#8364;35m for mental health in 2012 was allocated primarily for measures  to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems. 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams in 2012.  It is envisaged that the completion of the multidisciplinary profile of current teams will help progress the expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to all young people up to 18 years and reduce the waiting lists for this service.  Budget 2013 provides a further additional &#8364;35m for the continued development of our mental health services.  The HSE National Service Plan, which was recently approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.  I expect to see substantive progress in 2013 in relation to the strengthening of Community Mental Health Teams.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The fourth Annual Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), published by the HSE in December 2012 provides a detailed picture of the current stage of development of the HSE&#8217;s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.<\/p><p>  Last year I announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply from 31 March 2013 under this Act.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person.  The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit.  The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young.  This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care.<\/p><p>  I am concerned at the increasing cost of health care.  Last year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.<\/p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to contact a number of health insurance companies to find the plan that best suits their needs.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p>  In relation to the 16% of the insured population who currently have a lower level of cover, I am confident that when the new rates applicable under the Risk Equalisation come into effect on 31 March, there will continue to be a significant number of such policies available to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cover","counter":1376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1377,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[2784\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the list of advanced and non-advanced insurance cover which he referred to at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 27 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1378,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[3105\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, when introducing the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, it was his intention that holders of lower level insurance cover such as plan A would not have the advanced cover levy applied to their policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1379,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[3106\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WREE00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he has not ensured that the commitment he gave on 27 November 2012 to protect those who hold lower levels of health insurance cover such as plan A from the higher health insurance levy has not been met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1380,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 628, 668 and 669 together.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 was enacted last month.  It delivers on the Government commitment to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 January 2013.  Under Section 11E of the Act, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), as market regulator, is charged with evaluating and analysing all types of relevant contracts to be made available in the market.  Where it is satisfied that a type of relevant contract does not provide for &quot;advanced cover&quot;, the Authority shall specify by regulations, that the Authority is satisfied that this type of contract does not provide for such cover.  After making such regulations, the Authority will enter the particulars of the relevant contract in the Register of Health Insurance Contracts.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the industry under the auspices of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I introduced a number of amendments to the proposed Bill at D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  In order to allow the industry time to trade into the new Scheme, the legislation provided that the two stamp duty rates (and corresponding risk equalisation credits) would take effect from 31 March 2013.  In addition, at the industry&rsquo;s request, I made provision for an objective delineation between non-advanced and advanced cover.  In relation to lower level products (providing cover mainly for public hospitals), in November last year, the HIA considered that there were 47 products that provided cover mainly in public hospitals.  However, as then written, those products also provide some additional cover (e.g. full cover for some procedures or day case cover) which meant they did not comply with the definition of non-advanced cover.<\/p><p>  The HIA had significant dialogue with all four health insurers in December 2012 in the run up to its determination at 1 January 2013 as to whether the products on sale at that time provided cover at advanced \/non advanced level.  These conversations included enquiries as to how it arrived at its decisions in December.  I understand that the HIA has had further discussions with the industry and that it will continue to do so.

The scheme is founded on the basis that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home. Nursing home residents in receipt of financial support under the Scheme contribute towards the cost of their care according to their means. <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the HSE's total gross budget for long-term residential care was &#8364;994.7m. At the end of November there were 22,223 people  in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care. The HSE's 2013 Service Plan sets a target of 22,761 people to be in receipt of financial support at end-2013. Increasing the level of the asset contribution  from 5% to 7.5% will contribute to the sustainability of the Scheme and will enable additional applicants to be supported in 2013.  It has to be borne in mind that, during 2013, the HSE is required to achieve &#8364;721m of savings from its overall budget.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<ol type=\"1\"><li>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<li>  The first &#8364;36,000 for a person's assets, or &#8364;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.  <li>  The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. <li>  Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<li>  Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<li>  If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses. <li>  There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/ol>  Finally, the Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme include an examination of the sustainability of the Scheme. A public consultation to inform the review was concluded in July 2012. A summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December. The Department will shortly be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1492,"content":"<p>Question No. 671 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Investigations","counter":1493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":672,"qnumall":"[3143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure there is an immediate independent inquiry into the death of a person (details supplied)","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1495,"content":"<p>I understand from the HSE that a disability service provider is currently investigating the circumstances of the tragic death of a special needs child who was receiving respite care from it on 5th January 2013.

The airport has already been established as an independent company and legislation to merge the airport with a restructured Shannon Development will be advanced in 2013. A key initiative for the future will be the development of an international aviation services centre in and around the airport building on a range of aviation-related activities already undertaken in Shannon such as aircraft maintenance and leasing. In this regard, the report of November last by the Aviation Business Development Task Force states that such an aviation centre could create up to 3,000-3,500 new jobs within five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Fraud","counter":1520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1521,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[2588\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200075#WRGG04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps he is taking to tackle the problem of fraudulent motor insurance claims; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1522,"content":"<p>My Department's role with regard to motor insurance is confined to the enactment of policy relating to the relevant\u00a0Road Traffic Acts.

In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of the Department of Justice and Equality, earlier last year established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  Arising from the work of this group, among other things, a conference was held in Dublin Castle, supported by the Department of Justice and Equality.  At this conference various aspects of the ethnicity subject were considered from a wide spectrum of opinion.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Travellers in Ireland have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution. The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b><\/b>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.<\/p><p>Consideration of this issue remains ongoing with a view to ensuring that full analysis of  all aspects of the granting of ethnic status to Travellers is available to Government when coming to a decision on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1610,"content":"<p>Question No. 520 answered with Question No. 504.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":1611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1612,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[3004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the quarterly figures on burglary including car theft in County Meath by town and rural areas for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1613,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.<\/p><p>  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":1614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1615,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[3005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a visa application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1616,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the application to which the Deputy refers is an application for a certificate of naturalisation which was received from the person in question in April 2012.<\/p><p>  The application is at an advanced stage of processing and the applicant will be informed of my decision in due course.<\/p><p>  As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The 84 staff of the Property Registration Authority (PRA) currently located in that accommodation will be re-located before the expiry of the lease.  The Office of Public Works has identified accommodation in the Irish Life Centre, Dublin 1. However, it is unlikely that the proposed location will be sufficient to accommodate all PRA staff currently in the Setanta Centre and some staff will have to be re-located to Chancery Street.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, as indicated in the previous reply, it was decided, following the Government Review on the viability of all decentralisation projects that the PRA should remain in situ in the new premises located at the Golf Links Road, Roscommon.  The building was originally designed to accommodate 230. Given the on-going moratorium on recruitment, redeployment programmes and the ongoing reduction in staff numbers required under the Employment Control Framework (ECF), it is unlikely that the PRA will be in a position to locate the planned number of staff in Roscommon in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p><br \/>  In view of these circumstances, the PRA continues to work with the Office of Public Works to <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">ensure the optimum utilisation of the accommodation by other suitable public sector occupants.

I appointed an interim Board as a temporary measure from 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised, nor was the Chairman interviewed by an Oireachtas Committee.  Legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012 for the dissolution of the Board and the transfer of its functions back to the Department of Defence.<\/p><p>  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister   for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised.  Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.<\/p><p>  In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure.

He is now taking work forward and is consulting informally before bringing the matter back to the European Council, which I understand is planned for the meeting of 7 and 8 February. As Presidency, we will give whatever assistance we can to President Van Rompuy, who retains responsibility for, and control of, the process. <\/p><p>  As Presidency and nationally, Ireland wants an EU with sufficient funds to carry out its work, and a budget that can support growth and jobs. Agriculture has a particularly important role to play in the maintenance and creation of growth and jobs, so it is vital that a fully funded CAP continues to support the development of the sector. Indeed, the protection of the budget allocation for CAP is Ireland&rsquo;s number one financial priority, given its importance to our national agri-food development strategy and the importance of the sector to our economic recovery. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of it. <\/p><p>  As to whether a deal on CAP reform can be finalised before the end of the Irish Presidency, I believe it can be. However, three things must happen:<\/p><p>- there must be agreement on the MFF early in 2013,<\/p><p>- there must be rapid progress on outstanding technical and political issues,<\/p><p>- all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - need to engage actively in the negotiating process. <\/p><p>  The latter point is particularly important given the tight timescales we are facing, and the need to agree Council and Parliament positions before the trilogue process begins. <\/p><p>  I am optimistic about the prospects for agreement, but I am also keenly aware that we need real determination from all of the protagonists across all three institutions to commit to the process and to do what is necessary if we are to successfully conclude the reform of the CAP.

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding\/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector. <\/p><p>  Payments to producers in 2012, which were limited to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per participant and subject to EU state aid rules, were contingent on compliance with Programme requirements, i.e. attendance at a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events plus completion of two technology adoption tasks from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.<\/p><p>  I understand that the individual concerned did not obtain a payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks which related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. <\/p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case.

This generally involved trace or minute amounts of porcine or equine DNA with the exception of one burger in respect of which a high level of equine DNA (29% of meat content) was indicated. While the FSAI has given assurances that no food safety issues arise in this instance there are clearly very significant issues in respect of confidence in the quality of the products concerned and these are being addressed in the Department&#8217;s investigation. Affected product has been withdrawn from the markets by the food business operators involved.<\/p><p><br \/>  Further preliminary results relating to samples taken by the Department on Tuesday 15<sup>th<\/sup> January, from product manufactured in Silvercrest Foods in the period 3<sup>rd<\/sup> to 14<sup>th<\/sup> January, were published on Thursday 17<sup>th<\/sup> January.  These tests indicate the presence of equine DNA in samples of burgers, which were already withdrawn by the company concerned from the market.  Samples of raw ingredients were also tested.  Thirteen samples of finished burgers were tested for the presence of equine DNA.  Nine tested positive for traces of equine DNA and four tested negative.  Seven samples of raw ingredients were tested, one of which, sourced from another Member State, tested positive.  Samples of ingredients in burgers sourced from Irish suppliers tested negative for equine DNA.  My Department informed the company of these further laboratory test results and the company has suspended all production at the plant until it completes its investigation.  These results were fully assessed jointly by Department officials and the FSAI; and arrangements have been made to have the positive samples further analysed with a view to quantifying the percentage of non beef DNA present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The latest results from tests on burgers from Liffey Meats Ltd., published on 21<sup>st<\/sup> January, have shown that there was no presence of horse DNA in the product, which was manufactured between January 10<sup>th<\/sup> and January 16<sup>th<\/sup>.  These results are welcome and support the company&#8217;s claims that it has addressed concerns raised by the FSAI survey findings.  Primary responsibility for both the safety and quality of food placed on the market place lies with food business operators. This is subject to a series of official controls to verify compliance by the food business operators with their food safety management system - these controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>  The Department has permanent veterinary presence at all its export approved slaughtering plants. Controls at standalone processing plants are based on audits and inspections carried out by DAFM staff, based on risk assessment. In addition under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests normally relate to microbiological and chemical standards, focused on food safety and in accordance with EU testing requirements. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production and safety. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s food fraud control activities and these results arose from that control programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Intensive investigations are continuing with a view to identifying the source of the equine DNA in the Silvercrest Foods processing facility.  This includes further analysis of a range of samples from both burgers and ingredients.

This funding has been allocated.  A capital allocation of &#8364;3.25m for childcare facilities is available to my Department in 2013, and I am currently considering how this allocation can best be utilised for the benefit of the childcare sector. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department does however continue to provide support to parents to assist them with the daily cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs. <\/p><p>The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places for trainees and students whose children are enrolled in a participating service and who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC to qualify for childcare support under the programme.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro-rata basis.    <\/p><p><br \/>  The ECCE programme provides one free  preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free preschool provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes was in the region of &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.<\/p><p><br \/>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I and my colleague the Minister for Social Protection announced a joint school-age childcare initiative which will provide further support to both the community and the private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":1746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1747,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[2399\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding Ethiopian adoptions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1748,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[2793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding inter country adoptions with Belarus and Ethiopia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1749,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 574 together.<\/p><p>All inter country adoptions must meet the requirements of the Adoption Act 2010 including the provisions of the Hague Convention on Inter Country Adoption.<\/p><p>  Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.

The work of the Task Force informed the development of detailed legislative proposals to Government, covering a range of areas including the function and services to be overseen by the Agency, governance structures and implementation arrangements. Arising out of these proposals, the Government approved the Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The Agency will encompass services which are currently the responsibility of three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. Drafting of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is under way, in line with the policy decisions of Government. This legislation will be published, presented to the Oireachtas and debated at the earliest opportunity. The precise mechanism for this will be determined shortly.  A target date for the establishment of the new Agency will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   <\/p><p>  While the legislative process is under way, all necessary organisational preparations are continuing in parallel. These preparations are being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and involving representatives of the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the incoming management team of the new Agency.<\/p><p>  When established, the Agency will constitute one of the largest public agencies in the State with staff of over 4,000 employees. It represents one of the largest and most ambitious areas of public sector reform currently underway. The milestones already achieved are considerable: a dedicated management structure for child welfare and protection services has been established under the leadership of Gordon Jeyes with a reduction in management units and reporting levels; a dedicated budget has been established and publicly reported upon, to ensure budgetary transparency and accountability; there has been successful recruitment to five of the six top management posts with candidates now in place; and very significant progress has been made in addressing issues for staff by means of intensive engagement in an agreed industrial relations framework. From the outset I set a demanding timetable for the establishment of the new Agency. It is important that the pace of change is maintained, while appreciating the nature of this large scale change requires much advance preparation and reliance on the best standards of public administration. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has already been achieved in the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.

In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.

Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  These include SafeTALK which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reaching Out, ASIST, Taking Control, MindOut and STOP.  <\/p><p>A number of media awareness campaigns have been run in recent years including the <i>Let someone know <\/i>campaign which focused specifically on young people and delivered the message that it is important to reach out and seek the support of others.  Other awareness programmes include the <i>The Please Talk <\/i>  initiative, running in third level colleges since 2007, which encourages young people experiencing problems to talk to others and identifies the supports available to those in need.  <\/p><p><i>Jigsaw,<\/i>  an innovative community-based support service for young people, has been developed by Headstrong and is designed to promote systems of care that are accessible, youth-friendly, integrated, and engaging for young people.  Through additional Innovation Funding, this service is now available or in development in 11 sites around the country.  <\/p><p>Schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills have been working closely with the HSE and the NOSP to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention <\/i>  in post-primary schools.    These Guidelines will be launched in the very near future.<\/p><p><br \/>  The special provision of &#8364;35m for mental health in 2012 was allocated primarily for measures  to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems. 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams in 2012.  It is envisaged that the completion of the multidisciplinary profile of current teams will help progress the expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to all young people up to 18 years and reduce the waiting lists for this service.  Budget 2013 provides a further additional &#8364;35m for the continued development of our mental health services.  The HSE National Service Plan, which was recently approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.  I expect to see substantive progress in 2013 in relation to the strengthening of Community Mental Health Teams.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The fourth Annual Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), published by the HSE in December 2012 provides a detailed picture of the current stage of development of the HSE&#8217;s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.<\/p><p>  Last year I announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply from 31 March 2013 under this Act.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person.  The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit.  The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young.  This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care.<\/p><p>  I am concerned at the increasing cost of health care.  Last year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.<\/p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to contact a number of health insurance companies to find the plan that best suits their needs.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p>  In relation to the 16% of the insured population who currently have a lower level of cover, I am confident that when the new rates applicable under the Risk Equalisation come into effect on 31 March, there will continue to be a significant number of such policies available to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cover","counter":1928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1929,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[2784\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the list of advanced and non-advanced insurance cover which he referred to at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 27 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1930,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[3105\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, when introducing the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, it was his intention that holders of lower level insurance cover such as plan A would not have the advanced cover levy applied to their policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1931,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[3106\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WREE00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he has not ensured that the commitment he gave on 27 November 2012 to protect those who hold lower levels of health insurance cover such as plan A from the higher health insurance levy has not been met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1932,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 628, 668 and 669 together.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 was enacted last month.  It delivers on the Government commitment to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 January 2013.  Under Section 11E of the Act, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), as market regulator, is charged with evaluating and analysing all types of relevant contracts to be made available in the market.  Where it is satisfied that a type of relevant contract does not provide for &quot;advanced cover&quot;, the Authority shall specify by regulations, that the Authority is satisfied that this type of contract does not provide for such cover.  After making such regulations, the Authority will enter the particulars of the relevant contract in the Register of Health Insurance Contracts.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the industry under the auspices of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I introduced a number of amendments to the proposed Bill at D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  In order to allow the industry time to trade into the new Scheme, the legislation provided that the two stamp duty rates (and corresponding risk equalisation credits) would take effect from 31 March 2013.  In addition, at the industry&rsquo;s request, I made provision for an objective delineation between non-advanced and advanced cover.  In relation to lower level products (providing cover mainly for public hospitals), in November last year, the HIA considered that there were 47 products that provided cover mainly in public hospitals.  However, as then written, those products also provide some additional cover (e.g. full cover for some procedures or day case cover) which meant they did not comply with the definition of non-advanced cover.<\/p><p>  The HIA had significant dialogue with all four health insurers in December 2012 in the run up to its determination at 1 January 2013 as to whether the products on sale at that time provided cover at advanced \/non advanced level.  These conversations included enquiries as to how it arrived at its decisions in December.  I understand that the HIA has had further discussions with the industry and that it will continue to do so.

The scheme is founded on the basis that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home. Nursing home residents in receipt of financial support under the Scheme contribute towards the cost of their care according to their means. <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the HSE's total gross budget for long-term residential care was &#8364;994.7m. At the end of November there were 22,223 people  in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care. The HSE's 2013 Service Plan sets a target of 22,761 people to be in receipt of financial support at end-2013. Increasing the level of the asset contribution  from 5% to 7.5% will contribute to the sustainability of the Scheme and will enable additional applicants to be supported in 2013.  It has to be borne in mind that, during 2013, the HSE is required to achieve &#8364;721m of savings from its overall budget.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<ol type=\"1\"><li>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<li>  The first &#8364;36,000 for a person's assets, or &#8364;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.  <li>  The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. <li>  Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<li>  Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<li>  If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses. <li>  There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/ol>  Finally, the Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme include an examination of the sustainability of the Scheme. A public consultation to inform the review was concluded in July 2012. A summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December. The Department will shortly be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2044,"content":"<p>Question No. 671 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Investigations","counter":2045,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2046,"qnumday":672,"qnumall":"[3143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure there is an immediate independent inquiry into the death of a person (details supplied)","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2047,"content":"<p>I understand from the HSE that a disability service provider is currently investigating the circumstances of the tragic death of a special needs child who was receiving respite care from it on 5th January 2013.

The airport has already been established as an independent company and legislation to merge the airport with a restructured Shannon Development will be advanced in 2013. A key initiative for the future will be the development of an international aviation services centre in and around the airport building on a range of aviation-related activities already undertaken in Shannon such as aircraft maintenance and leasing. In this regard, the report of November last by the Aviation Business Development Task Force states that such an aviation centre could create up to 3,000-3,500 new jobs within five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Fraud","counter":2072,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2073,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[2588\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200076#WRGG04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps he is taking to tackle the problem of fraudulent motor insurance claims; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2074,"content":"<p>My Department's role with regard to motor insurance is confined to the enactment of policy relating to the relevant\u00a0Road Traffic Acts.

As Presidency, we will give whatever assistance we can to President Van Rompuy, who retains responsibility for, and control of, the process. <\/p><p>  As Presidency and nationally, Ireland wants an EU with sufficient funds to carry out its work, and a budget that can support growth and jobs. Agriculture has a particularly important role to play in the maintenance and creation of growth and jobs, so it is vital that a fully funded CAP continues to support the development of the sector. Indeed, the protection of the budget allocation for CAP is Ireland&rsquo;s number one financial priority, given its importance to our national agri-food development strategy and the importance of the sector to our economic recovery. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of it. <\/p><p>  As to whether a deal on CAP reform can be finalised before the end of the Irish Presidency, I believe it can be.

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding\/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector. <\/p><p>  Payments to producers in 2012, which were limited to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per participant and subject to EU state aid rules, were contingent on compliance with Programme requirements, i.e. attendance at a prescribed number of discussion group meetings or approved national events plus completion of two technology adoption tasks from a menu of eight designed to enhance on-farm efficiency. The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.<\/p><p>  I understand that the individual concerned did not obtain a payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks which related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary surgeon. Participants who chose that task were required to join the voluntary Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. <\/p><p>  The rationale for this approach is that the BTAP thus recognised and rewarded producers who tested their herds during the initial voluntary phase of a national programme to eradicate a highly contagious and costly cattle disease. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animals born in 2012. Given that it is now mandatory for herd owners to take a tissue tag sample from all calves born after 1 January 2013, a producer should not entertain a legitimate expectation of receiving a BTAP payment for complying with a statutory requirement. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no Programme payment was possible in this case. However, subject to satisfying eligibility criteria, the producer concerned is free to participate in year two of the Programme, the opening of which I announced last week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200077#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":2147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200077#WRZ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2148,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[2492\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200077#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of agri environment options scheme will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; if the payment is being held up because of a penalty of less than three percent; if so, if the payment could be processed manually because the scheme participant is most anxious to receive payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2149,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;1,050.30 and &euro;3,629.48 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

This generally involved trace or minute amounts of porcine or equine DNA with the exception of one burger in respect of which a high level of equine DNA (29% of meat content) was indicated. While the FSAI has given assurances that no food safety issues arise in this instance there are clearly very significant issues in respect of confidence in the quality of the products concerned and these are being addressed in the Department&#8217;s investigation. Affected product has been withdrawn from the markets by the food business operators involved.<\/p><p><br \/>  Further preliminary results relating to samples taken by the Department on Tuesday 15<sup>th<\/sup> January, from product manufactured in Silvercrest Foods in the period 3<sup>rd<\/sup> to 14<sup>th<\/sup> January, were published on Thursday 17<sup>th<\/sup> January.  These tests indicate the presence of equine DNA in samples of burgers, which were already withdrawn by the company concerned from the market.  Samples of raw ingredients were also tested.  Thirteen samples of finished burgers were tested for the presence of equine DNA.  Nine tested positive for traces of equine DNA and four tested negative.  Seven samples of raw ingredients were tested, one of which, sourced from another Member State, tested positive.  Samples of ingredients in burgers sourced from Irish suppliers tested negative for equine DNA.  My Department informed the company of these further laboratory test results and the company has suspended all production at the plant until it completes its investigation.  These results were fully assessed jointly by Department officials and the FSAI; and arrangements have been made to have the positive samples further analysed with a view to quantifying the percentage of non beef DNA present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The latest results from tests on burgers from Liffey Meats Ltd., published on 21<sup>st<\/sup> January, have shown that there was no presence of horse DNA in the product, which was manufactured between January 10<sup>th<\/sup> and January 16<sup>th<\/sup>.  These results are welcome and support the company&#8217;s claims that it has addressed concerns raised by the FSAI survey findings.  Primary responsibility for both the safety and quality of food placed on the market place lies with food business operators. This is subject to a series of official controls to verify compliance by the food business operators with their food safety management system - these controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>  The Department has permanent veterinary presence at all its export approved slaughtering plants. Controls at standalone processing plants are based on audits and inspections carried out by DAFM staff, based on risk assessment. In addition under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests normally relate to microbiological and chemical standards, focused on food safety and in accordance with EU testing requirements. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production and safety. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s food fraud control activities and these results arose from that control programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Intensive investigations are continuing with a view to identifying the source of the equine DNA in the Silvercrest Foods processing facility.  This includes further analysis of a range of samples from both burgers and ingredients. Detailed analysis of records held by the company relating to the sourcing of ingredients and the incorporation of these ingredients is also being conducted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":2229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2230,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[2964\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on whether the transport of live animals to African and Middle Eastern countries is conforming to the guidelines of the International Animal Health Organisation; the type of inspection of the ships that will be undertaken; his views on standards of slaughter houses in these countries; his view on whether in exporting live animals we are exporting jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2231,"content":"<p>Ireland has a strict system of transport rules in respect of both national and international journeys.

Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.

This funding has been allocated.  A capital allocation of &#8364;3.25m for childcare facilities is available to my Department in 2013, and I am currently considering how this allocation can best be utilised for the benefit of the childcare sector. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department does however continue to provide support to parents to assist them with the daily cost of childcare.  This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs. <\/p><p>The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places for trainees and students whose children are enrolled in a participating service and who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC to qualify for childcare support under the programme.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro-rata basis.    <\/p><p><br \/>  The ECCE programme provides one free  preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free preschool provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes was in the region of &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.<\/p><p><br \/>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I and my colleague the Minister for Social Protection announced a joint school-age childcare initiative which will provide further support to both the community and the private childcare sector. This initiative, which represents a full year investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":2244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2245,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[2399\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding Ethiopian adoptions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":2246,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[2793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200078#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding inter country adoptions with Belarus and Ethiopia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2247,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 574 together.<\/p><p>All inter country adoptions must meet the requirements of the Adoption Act 2010 including the provisions of the Hague Convention on Inter Country Adoption.<\/p><p>  Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.

The work of the Task Force informed the development of detailed legislative proposals to Government, covering a range of areas including the function and services to be overseen by the Agency, governance structures and implementation arrangements. Arising out of these proposals, the Government approved the Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The Agency will encompass services which are currently the responsibility of three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as a priority. Drafting of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is under way, in line with the policy decisions of Government. This legislation will be published, presented to the Oireachtas and debated at the earliest opportunity. The precise mechanism for this will be determined shortly.  A target date for the establishment of the new Agency will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   <\/p><p>  While the legislative process is under way, all necessary organisational preparations are continuing in parallel. These preparations are being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and involving representatives of the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the incoming management team of the new Agency.<\/p><p>  When established, the Agency will constitute one of the largest public agencies in the State with staff of over 4,000 employees. It represents one of the largest and most ambitious areas of public sector reform currently underway. The milestones already achieved are considerable: a dedicated management structure for child welfare and protection services has been established under the leadership of Gordon Jeyes with a reduction in management units and reporting levels; a dedicated budget has been established and publicly reported upon, to ensure budgetary transparency and accountability; there has been successful recruitment to five of the six top management posts with candidates now in place; and very significant progress has been made in addressing issues for staff by means of intensive engagement in an agreed industrial relations framework. From the outset I set a demanding timetable for the establishment of the new Agency. It is important that the pace of change is maintained, while appreciating the nature of this large scale change requires much advance preparation and reliance on the best standards of public administration. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that very considerable progress has already been achieved in the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.

In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.

Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  These include SafeTALK which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reaching Out, ASIST, Taking Control, MindOut and STOP.  <\/p><p>A number of media awareness campaigns have been run in recent years including the <i>Let someone know <\/i>campaign which focused specifically on young people and delivered the message that it is important to reach out and seek the support of others.  Other awareness programmes include the <i>The Please Talk <\/i>  initiative, running in third level colleges since 2007, which encourages young people experiencing problems to talk to others and identifies the supports available to those in need.  <\/p><p><i>Jigsaw,<\/i>  an innovative community-based support service for young people, has been developed by Headstrong and is designed to promote systems of care that are accessible, youth-friendly, integrated, and engaging for young people.  Through additional Innovation Funding, this service is now available or in development in 11 sites around the country.  <\/p><p>Schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills have been working closely with the HSE and the NOSP to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention <\/i>  in post-primary schools.    These Guidelines will be launched in the very near future.<\/p><p><br \/>  The special provision of &#8364;35m for mental health in 2012 was allocated primarily for measures  to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems. 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams in 2012.  It is envisaged that the completion of the multidisciplinary profile of current teams will help progress the expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to all young people up to 18 years and reduce the waiting lists for this service.  Budget 2013 provides a further additional &#8364;35m for the continued development of our mental health services.  The HSE National Service Plan, which was recently approved by the Minister for Health, commits to the further development of suicide prevention initiatives, forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of over 470 additional staff to implement these measures.  I expect to see substantive progress in 2013 in relation to the strengthening of Community Mental Health Teams.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The fourth Annual Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), published by the HSE in December 2012 provides a detailed picture of the current stage of development of the HSE&#8217;s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.<\/p><p>  Last year I announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply from 31 March 2013 under this Act.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person.  The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit.  The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young.  This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care.<\/p><p>  I am concerned at the increasing cost of health care.  Last year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.<\/p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to contact a number of health insurance companies to find the plan that best suits their needs.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p>  In relation to the 16% of the insured population who currently have a lower level of cover, I am confident that when the new rates applicable under the Risk Equalisation come into effect on 31 March, there will continue to be a significant number of such policies available to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200082#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cover","counter":2426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200082#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2427,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[2784\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200082#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the list of advanced and non-advanced insurance cover which he referred to at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 27 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2428,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[3105\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200082#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, when introducing the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, it was his intention that holders of lower level insurance cover such as plan A would not have the advanced cover levy applied to their policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2429,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[3106\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200082#WREE00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he has not ensured that the commitment he gave on 27 November 2012 to protect those who hold lower levels of health insurance cover such as plan A from the higher health insurance levy has not been met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2430,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 628, 668 and 669 together.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 was enacted last month.  It delivers on the Government commitment to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 January 2013.  Under Section 11E of the Act, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), as market regulator, is charged with evaluating and analysing all types of relevant contracts to be made available in the market.  Where it is satisfied that a type of relevant contract does not provide for &quot;advanced cover&quot;, the Authority shall specify by regulations, that the Authority is satisfied that this type of contract does not provide for such cover.  After making such regulations, the Authority will enter the particulars of the relevant contract in the Register of Health Insurance Contracts.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the industry under the auspices of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I introduced a number of amendments to the proposed Bill at D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  In order to allow the industry time to trade into the new Scheme, the legislation provided that the two stamp duty rates (and corresponding risk equalisation credits) would take effect from 31 March 2013.  In addition, at the industry&rsquo;s request, I made provision for an objective delineation between non-advanced and advanced cover.  In relation to lower level products (providing cover mainly for public hospitals), in November last year, the HIA considered that there were 47 products that provided cover mainly in public hospitals.  However, as then written, those products also provide some additional cover (e.g. full cover for some procedures or day case cover) which meant they did not comply with the definition of non-advanced cover.<\/p><p>  The HIA had significant dialogue with all four health insurers in December 2012 in the run up to its determination at 1 January 2013 as to whether the products on sale at that time provided cover at advanced \/non advanced level.  These conversations included enquiries as to how it arrived at its decisions in December.  I understand that the HIA has had further discussions with the industry and that it will continue to do so.

The scheme is founded on the basis that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home. Nursing home residents in receipt of financial support under the Scheme contribute towards the cost of their care according to their means. <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012, the HSE's total gross budget for long-term residential care was &#8364;994.7m. At the end of November there were 22,223 people  in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care. The HSE's 2013 Service Plan sets a target of 22,761 people to be in receipt of financial support at end-2013. Increasing the level of the asset contribution  from 5% to 7.5% will contribute to the sustainability of the Scheme and will enable additional applicants to be supported in 2013.  It has to be borne in mind that, during 2013, the HSE is required to achieve &#8364;721m of savings from its overall budget.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<ol type=\"1\"><li>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<li>  The first &#8364;36,000 for a person's assets, or &#8364;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.  <li>  The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. <li>  Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<li>  Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<li>  If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses. <li>  There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/ol>  Finally, the Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme include an examination of the sustainability of the Scheme. A public consultation to inform the review was concluded in July 2012. A summary report of the submissions received was published on the Department's website in December. The Department will shortly be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2542,"content":"<p>Question No. 671 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Investigations","counter":2543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2544,"qnumday":672,"qnumall":"[3143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure there is an immediate independent inquiry into the death of a person (details supplied)","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2545,"content":"<p>I understand from the HSE that a disability service provider is currently investigating the circumstances of the tragic death of a special needs child who was receiving respite care from it on 5th January 2013.

The airport has already been established as an independent company and legislation to merge the airport with a restructured Shannon Development will be advanced in 2013. A key initiative for the future will be the development of an international aviation services centre in and around the airport building on a range of aviation-related activities already undertaken in Shannon such as aircraft maintenance and leasing. In this regard, the report of November last by the Aviation Business Development Task Force states that such an aviation centre could create up to 3,000-3,500 new jobs within five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Fraud","counter":2570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2571,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[2588\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012200084#WRGG04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps he is taking to tackle the problem of fraudulent motor insurance claims; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2572,"content":"<p>My Department's role with regard to motor insurance is confined to the enactment of policy relating to the relevant\u00a0Road Traffic Acts.
