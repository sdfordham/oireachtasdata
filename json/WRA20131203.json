The creative industries now encompass more than the traditional areas of the arts, film, music and literature, and include areas like advertising, as well as the newer industries such as social media, gaming and animation.<\/p><p>  As Minister with responsibility for arts, culture and heritage for the whole country, I do not want to single out any part of Dublin, or indeed any other part of the country, as requiring branding as a creative quarter. Of course, Dublin 8 has a number of unique historical, cultural and creative characteristics, but so have many other areas in the country. I have no statutory function in the designation of such areas.<\/p><p>  One of the actions I have prioritised as Minister is in relation to encouraging the fostering of creativity in our children and young people. Initiatives have been introduced in our schools to ensure that they develop this very important skill and that there is a broader appreciation of the value of the arts as an instrument to nurture and develop creativity.  <\/p><p>The importance of this matter is well recognised internationally. Indeed, during the recent Irish Presidency of the EU, Irish officials worked closely with their EU colleagues on a seven year plan to put in place appropriate policies and a funding framework to drive the <i>Creative Europe<\/i>   programme for the years 2014 to 2020.<\/p><p>  In the Irish context, up to relatively recently Ireland may have had a somewhat fragmented approach to the development of the creative industries but, over the last few years, there have been some important initiatives at national and sectoral levels which are fostering a stronger more cohesive approach to this sector. <\/p><p><i>Innovation Ireland<\/i>   is a report published in March 2010 by an inter-disciplinary group, as a follow-up to the SMART Economy strategy. The report underscores how the arts can be used to drive jobs in the digital economy and creative industries, as well as the vital role of culture in fostering creativity in the education system. It also identifies the scope for cultural creativity and science to work together to re-position technology and innovation in innovative new ways in the public mind, and help re-position artists, culture and creative minds into the centre of innovative businesses.<\/p><p>  The report highlights the need amongst employers in innovative industries and businesses for creative thinkers who are culturally aware to drive their business forward. As we shift to a more knowledge-based, services-oriented economy, I believe that Ireland is well placed to lead developments in this area because of its established arts and cultural heritage. <\/p><p>  The digital economy has tremendous potential to create new jobs and new growth.  Companies in this sector are amongst the fastest growing in the world and have become major brands.  The arts and the creative sector also can play an innovative role in positioning Ireland in a new way, particularly when science and arts are brought together to utilise technology in insightful and original ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Waterways Development","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[51471\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding the Ulster Canal restoration project; the steps that must be taken to complete the project; the indicative timeline for the completion of the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in July 2007 the North\/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) agreed to proceed with the restoration of the section of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.

The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors, which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged &ndash; giving the arts a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.

Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  <\/p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland. <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will be continuing to avail of every opportunity to promote philanthropy in order to complement Government funding of the arts and to encourage more arts organisations to engage with business to their mutual benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[51460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he continues to have discussions with stakeholders in the arts and heritage sectors with a view to the maximisation of the sectors&rsquo; ability to continue to impact favourably on the economy with particular reference to the need to capitalise on previous years&rsquo; efforts such as The Gathering as a means of promoting Irish arts and heritage at home and abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A range of actions that have been taken to support The Gathering were outlined in my previous replies to the Deputy. <\/p><p>  My Department and its agencies have made a substantial contribution towards ensuring a strong linkage between the cultural area and tourism and, in so doing, to The Gathering. This promotes and enhances the artistic image of Ireland. Indeed, the arts are very much part of our tourism offering. For example, over 1 million tourists visit the National Museum annually, free of charge. The number of people coming to Ireland for the cultural encounter is increasing all the time.<\/p><p>  My Department's Culture Ireland Programme supports artists to travel abroad and promote this country. Efforts are continuing to maximise the benefits from that funding and, in this regard, I have arranged that other State agencies, such as the IDA and Tourism Ireland, will be enabled to capitalise on the presence of some of our best artists when travelling abroad so as to further promote the country. <\/p><p>  Throughout 2013, my Department has worked to encourage linkages between arts and culture and The Gathering initiative and these efforts will continue into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[51455\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the contact he has had with the National Asset Management Agency and Chartered Land relating to the national monument on Moore Street, Dublin 1; the progress made on the redevelopment of this site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>On 16 July last I made a determination in relation to a consent application and related Environmental Impact Statement submitted by the owners under the National Monuments Acts in relation to proposed works on the Moore Street national monument site.  <\/p><p>  The national monument is in private ownership and, accordingly, the advancement of proposals that reflect the terms of the consent I have granted is a matter for the owners.

A summary of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA since 2005 years is provided below.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>Total ODA in &euro; Millions <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>622.08 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>628.90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>657.04<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>675.83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>722.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>920.66 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>870.870<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>813.962<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>578.460<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>6,490.00 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Detailed analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is provided in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid annual report available on the Irish Aid website at   .  <\/p><p>  Responding to humanitarian emergencies and their aftermath is a central feature of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.

Recovery assistance provides focused support to countries emerging from conflict or natural disasters, assisting affected populations re-establish their lives.  In responding to emergencies and their aftermath, Irish Aid works with a variety of partners to best meet the needs of affected communities - including host Governments, Irish and international NGOs, the International Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement, and multilateral agencies such as the UN.   <\/p><p>  Given the unpredictable nature of this type of aid, annual funding varies from year to year.

The detailed analysis for Emergency and Recovery Assistance for each year is included in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid annual report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300053#WRA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300054#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[51946\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300054#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any recent discussions with members of the British Government in relation to the need for an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.    The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. <\/p><p>  There are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999). <\/p><p>  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is, or was, wholly exercised outside the State. In other words, the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State. <\/p><p>  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent in accordance with the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984.<\/p><p>  The fact that there are very limited situations where the levy does not have to be paid explains, in part at least, why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to keep the rate of the additional levy as low as 0.15%. Making an exception for the Permanent TSB scheme, notwithstanding that it clearly does not meet all of the existing qualifying conditions for exception, will inevitably give rise to demands for exceptions to be granted in other situations that would be viewed by those seeking them as being equally deserving.

In accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date, which was 1 May 2013 for 2013 and for subsequent years is 1 November in the preceding year.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  <\/p><p>  The 1 November liability date has been the subject of a number of previous Parliamentary Questions.  In reply to Questions Nos. 221 (49518\/13) and 223 (49556\/13) on 19 November 2013 I stated that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  <\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  <\/p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if they do not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 they will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.<\/p><p>Detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>   and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300055#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300055#WRC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[51552\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300055#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason it is a premium rate number for persons ringing regarding queries on their property tax; and the reason persons with more than one property are being discriminated against when it comes to paying their tax as they can only pay it online.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Local Property Tax (LPT) helpline 1890 200 255 number is a low cost phone service and is not a premium rate number.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to advise on the cost to a person of phoning the Local Property Tax 1890 telephone helpline.  The price is dependent on the individual&rsquo;s phone network as well as the type of &lsquo;phone package&rsquo; that the individual has with his\/her operator.  Some operators operate on a price per call basis while others charge per minute.    The requirement for owners of multiple properties to file and pay LPT Returns electronically is contained in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).  The Commissioners have confirmed that a significant number of multiple property owners are already obliged, by virtue of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to pay and file electronically other tax returns they complete and this is in keeping with Revenue&rsquo;s strategic objective to encourage the use of electronic channels.  It is also in line with the Government&rsquo;s e-agenda for service delivery.<\/p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s on-line system for filing and paying LPT is secure, user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to file Returns and pay the tax, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties and makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available.  In addition, property owners who use the on-line system also benefit from a three-week extended filing deadline.  Providing an extension to filing deadlines is common practice when a taxpayer uses Revenue&rsquo;s online services to meet his\/her obligations.  <\/p><p>  Section 36 of the Act allows a property owner to nominate another person, such as a relative, to file and pay on-line on their behalf.  Furthermore, owners can call the LPT Helpline 1890 200 255, where there is a dedicated service whereby the return may be filed on-line on their behalf.

LPT is a self-assessed tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property as at 1 May 2013.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands of &euro;50,000 width from &euro;100,001 to &euro;1 million  As property owners were not required to provide a precise value for their property, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.   When completing their LPT Return earlier this year, it was expected that property owners would make their best endeavours to self-assess the value of their property at 1 May 2013 and the Revenue Commissioners provided guidance, including an online valuation guidance tool, to assist property owners in making their self-assessment.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that the initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.  Accordingly where the owner self-assessed the value of their residential property on 1 May 2013 and placed it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date, the property has sold for an amount less than the self-assessed amount, the owner would not be entitled to a refund of tax.  In the same way, if the property had increased in value in that period, no additional LPT charge would apply.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that if the liable person has genuinely overpaid the tax through an error or mistake concerning the property&rsquo;s value as at 1 May 2013, then they should write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Ennis, Co Clare, setting out fully the nature of the error or mistake and explaining the circumstances in which the overpayment arose.

In that regard, I would like to clarify that the encashment option confers no rights on public servants to early access to pension benefits.  The encashment option operates in the context of the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, which places a life-time limit on an individual&rsquo;s tax&ndash;relieved pension benefits. The SFT regime is designed to discourage over-funding of pension savings by such means. It addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way, it acts to deter the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted. Among other changes to the SFT regime being introduced by Finance (No.2) Bill 2013, is a reduction in the value of the life-time limit from its current level of &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The encashment option was introduced to deal with particular difficulties that individuals with both private and public service pension arrangements would otherwise face from the operation of the SFT regime.  An individual in the private sector is generally able to prevent or minimise any breaching of the SFT, or a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), if he or she has one, by ceasing to contribute to, or accrue benefits under, a pension scheme. However, affected individuals in the public service have no control over their accrual of public service pension entitlements and, as a result, significant chargeable excesses could arise on the public service pension entitlement at retirement in certain circumstances. This is the case where such individuals have built up substantial private sector pension savings before taking up a public service career.<\/p><p>  Because the SFT regime operates by aggregating the capital value of pension benefits taken over time, where such private sector benefits are drawn down first their capital value would aggregate with the capital value of the public service pension rights when subsequently drawn down, resulting in, as mentioned, very significant chargeable excesses and penal tax charges on the public service pension which the affected individual would be powerless to abate.<\/p><p>  Concerns were expressed that this could have a significant disincentive effect for some people to remain in the public service or hinder the future recruitment into the public service of exceptionally well-qualified people from the private sector.<\/p><p>  To deal with this, I introduced a once&ndash;off opportunity for individuals who meet the qualifying conditions, to encash their private sector pension rights, in whole or in part, from age 60, with a view to preventing or minimising the chargeable excess that would otherwise arise when the public service pension crystallises. The private sector pension rights concerned would invariably be personal pensions which would be accessible from age 60 in any event (so there is no issue of early access). The exercise of the option attracts tax at the point of encashment on the full value of the rights at a ring-fenced rate of 41% plus USC of 4%. This is aimed at broadly neutralising the tax relief that such individuals enjoyed when building up their private pension funds. No tax-free lump sum is available from the pension scheme where the encashment option is exercised and it is the pension scheme administrator who is primarily responsible for deducting and remitting the &ldquo;encashment tax&rdquo; to Revenue.<\/p><p>  The qualifying conditions can be summarised as follows. Firstly, the individual must, on 8 February 2012 (the date of publication of the 2012 Finance Bill), be a &ldquo;relevant individual&rdquo;, meaning that he or she must;<\/p><p>  - Be a member of both a private sector and public service pension scheme, or<\/p><p>  - Be a member of a public service pension scheme and have drawn down their private sector pensions in the period 7 December 2005 to 7 February 2012, or<\/p><p>  - Be a member of a private sector scheme on, or after, 7 February 2012 and subsequently become a member of a public service scheme, and<\/p><p>  - Remain an active member of the public service scheme until their retirement date.<\/p><p>  Secondly, the combined capital value of the pension scheme savings, both private and public, must be likely to exceed the SFT, or the individuals PFT, if they have one, in circumstances where the intention is that the public service pension benefits will be crystallised or drawn down last (i.e. after all the private sector pensions benefits have been drawn down). It is this sequence of cashing in the private sector benefits first that would place the individual in a position whereby a chargeable excess would fall mostly, or entirely, on the public service pension. In extreme situations, where an individual, on taking up a pensionable post in the public service, had already built up private sector pension savings equal to the SFT, or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, every euro of public service pension accrued would be subject to chargeable excess tax of 41% in addition to the tax on the pension at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate when paid out.<\/p><p>  It is important to note, that in no case can the exercise of the encashment option reduce the chargeable excess tax due on an individual&rsquo;s public service pension benefits if the capital value of those benefits on their own exceeds the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT.<\/p><p>  The option came into effect from 8 February 2012 (the date of publication of Finance Bill 2012) with transitional arrangements for affected individuals who may have drawn down their private sector pensions before that date but remained members of a public service scheme on or after that date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[51777\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if any consideration has been given to developing a tax credit in the future for draw downs from pensions that have been subjected to a levy since 2011 and beyond; his views on whether such a credit would offset the disincentive to save caused by the taxation of pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the stamp duty levy that applies to the assets of funded pension schemes and plans approved by the Revenue Commissioners under Irish tax legislation.

The application of the new age-related valuation factors to Defined Benefit pension rights accrued after 1 January 2014, reflects legal advice which I received to the effect that pension savings and pension rights accrued up to that date should be protected. On foot of that advice, and as occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005 and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m (the level of the current SFT) and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs. The ability to claim a PFT applies to affected individuals with Defined Benefit or Defined Contribution pension rights or who have a combination of  both.<\/p><p>  However, unlike previous occasions, the protection or &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014 from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m, but also of the increase, from that date, in the valuation factors used for converting Defined Benefit pension rights into capital value equivalents for the purposes of the SFT regime. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that such rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The estimated yield of &euro;120 million from the proposed changes to the SFT regime is based to a significant degree on assumed behavioural impacts. The yield is expected to arise in two ways. Firstly and mainly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and secondly by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or PFT, as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT. Given the range of variable assumptions on which the estimate of the yield from the current changes is based, I do not consider that a reliable estimate of yield could be provided on foot of the hypothetical assumption contained in the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Issues","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD03000"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[51831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 214 of 23 April 2013, when he stated he welcomed KBC Group&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish market and note that it is planning to develop its business in Ireland further with new retail branches and distribution platforms to be rolled out in 2013 and continued expansion of its retail product portfolio; if he will confirm the quantum of new lending by KBC in Ireland in 2013; and his views on KBC&rsquo;s deposit gathering operation which has seen retail deposits increase threefold since 2011 from &euro;1 billion to &euro;2.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2013.

Under Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 all designated bodies (including all financial institutions) are required to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners all suspicious transactions, including any unusually large cash movements.  Similarly, any solicitors or other practitioners who execute property transfer instruments are also designated persons for the purposes of the money laundering legislation and must satisfy themselves as to the source of purchase monies in drawing up the transfer instrument and report anything untoward to the Garda&iacute; and to Revenue.<\/p><p>  Cases are selected by Revenue for examination based on the presence of various risk indicators.  The Revenue Commissioners are assisted in that process by their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system that contains various types of information including information relating to the purchase of property and suspicious transactions involving the movement of monies.  In the case selection process, of particular interest to Revenue are those individuals whose funds used to purchase a property appear to have come from hidden or undeclared income or from unexplained wealth.  In such cases, Revenue carry out the necessary &lsquo;checks and balances&rsquo; with a view to determining whether the money used to fund (or part fund) the purchase of a property came from illegal activity, including the shadow economy. Where the explanation as to the source of money used to purchase a property is not creditable, Revenue then carry out further checks, including audits or investigations, which may result in Revenue seeking additional tax, interest on late payment of tax and penalties as well as prosecutions for making false tax returns.<\/p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not retain statistics for each separate risk factor used to trigger a case for examination as the case selection of a case for examination generally includes a number of risk factors including the level of income shown in a person&rsquo;s tax returns.

I will, however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%. I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties. The additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The yield from the pension fund levy in 2014 is estimated at &euro;675 million. The yield from the pension fund levy at the reduced rate of 0.15% in 2015 is estimated at &euro;135 million.<\/p><p>  The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>. I have no plans to change this approach. One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> &ndash; the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services &ndash; was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014.  The combined cost of these initiatives is estimated at close to &euro;400 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  The <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures. While the details of the expenditure on these measures are a matter for my colleagues in Cabinet, I would ask the Deputy to note that the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>   originally provided for 5,000 places under Jobbridge, the National Internship scheme and 5,900 places under the Springboard scheme. Numbers who have participated in Jobbridge have now exceeded 20,000 with an evaluation by Indecon Economic Consultants finding that 61.4% of survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships. The Springboard scheme, now in its third iteration, has expanded to over 16,500 places. The expansion of these schemes, reflective of their success, will require further funding from the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  The extent of the potential State liabilities from the pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties is a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. However, I can say that agreement has been secured for these liabilities to be met by the Exchequer, where they arise. As I have already indicated, however, the proceeds from the levy that accrue to the Exchequer are not set aside in the manner suggested in the question and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300056#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Generic Drugs Substitution","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300057#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[51885\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300057#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a company's (details supplied) recent assessment that Irish GDP is understated because of the way Central Statistics Office measures production in the pharmaceutical sector arising from its statistical treatment of generic drugs as new products; if he will provide further detail on this alleged discrepancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, industrial production and exports of chemicals and pharmaceuticals have been impacted by declines in volumes since early 2012. This is most likely due to the expiry of patents on certain &lsquo;blockbuster&rsquo; drugs, an effect known as the &lsquo;patent cliff&rsquo;. The patent cliff has also weighed down on GDP, given the comparatively large weighting of the sector in Irish output and exports.<\/p><p>  The impact of the patent cliff is likely to result in some shift in Irish pharmaceutical production away from branded blockbuster drugs towards generic drugs. When discussing the statistical treatment, consider the example where, in a given quarter, the patented version leaves the relevant price index and the off-patented version and\/or generic equivalent enters.   The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will treat these as a new product, rather than the same product at a lower price. This means that any decline in the value of production would be accounted for as a volume shift rather than a price change as there is no change in the price index <i>per se<\/i>  . This methodology is in line with current international practice.<\/p><p>  However the precise impact of the patent cliff on Irish production patterns remains to be seen. It is not certain that production of chemically-identical drugs will always continue in Irish plants in a post-patent environment.

Children with Dyspraxia may be entitled to additional teaching provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the educational psychological assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular.

In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO and it is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs. The NCSE has recently published an Information Booklet for Parents of Children with Special Educational Needs, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>  Finally, the Department provides for support for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyspraxia. The Special Education Support Service (SESS) manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs.

It is important to note that this block grant covers not only the day-to-day costs of schools but also the running costs of ETB head-offices and other activities apart from the second-level programme. Each ETB has a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and may distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. <\/p><p>  I am aware that the JMB's Pre-Budget Submission for 2012 suggested a difference of &euro;212 in funding for each student attending a voluntary secondary school, in comparison to an ETB school or college.

It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. While there are some arrears of casework in this area, they are not significant and in any event, revision applications received from the public are disposed of without undue delay. While there has been a marked decrease in the number of applications for revision of valuation in recent years, mainly due to the economic downturn, the vast majority of applications are from the local authorities with whom the Valuation Office is in close liaison, to ensure that priority cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agree timelines for the delivery of revisions generally. <\/p><p>  The Valuation Office has also been conducting a National Revaluation Programme. In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.<\/p><p>  The Commissioner is pursuing a balanced programme of revision and revaluation casework and with the completion of the Dublin City and Waterford revaluation programmes imminent, a concentration of effort is being applied currently to the revision work programme in consultation with the local authorities<\/p><p>  Conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State has been the policy of successive Governments since enactment of the Valuation Act 2001. The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee stage, provides for a number of initiatives to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also being initiated as a pilot project. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.<\/p><p>  Regarding the levying of rates, the position is that under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the determination of valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Rates can only be collected by the rating authority on property which has been valued under the Valuation Act, 2001 and there is no mechanism to collect rates, retrospectively or otherwise, pending the determination and issue of the valuation under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300059#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Expenditure","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300059#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[51452\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300059#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the company (details supplied) awarded the contract to carry out Wicklow's River Dargle flood defence scheme has gone into examinership and has proceeded to close down operations; while it appears that the company has received payment, many of the subcontractors have not been paid; if Wicklow County Council is responsible for payment to subcontractors and their employees; the persons now responsible for the completion of this important project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Total sales of client companies of Enterprise Ireland in 2012 exceeded &euro;30bn. Export growth was achieved across all overseas territories and this level of growth is greatly supported by an extensive promotional programme, including trade events, trade fairs and trade missions.

The law is clear on the matter of employment of 3rd country nationals - it is illegal for such a 3rd country national to be employed without the State's permission and it is an offence for both the 3rd country national and the employer concerned.  Illegal employment of 3rd country nationals creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>  Migrant workers are a vulnerable class of people and language difficulties, cultural differences, and lack of social networks can disadvantage migrants and increase the potential for abuse by unscrupulous employers. Ireland has a very thorough employment rights legal framework.  Careful consideration is given to the potential for abuse and many of the criteria in evaluating employment permits applications focus on the bona-fides of the employer and the protection of the employee.  This feature of the employment permits regime will be preserved in the new Employment Permits Bill currently being drafted.<\/p><p>  Following the result of the High Court Judgement of 31st August 2012 concerning Mr. Younis, I committed to amending the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter. Also, subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce new safeguards in the legislation that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that a contract of employment is illegal and therefore not legally binding.<\/p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill, subject to Government approval, will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with 3rd country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a 3rd country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permits&rsquo; regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date.  Such people may have established roots in Ireland and it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit.<\/p><p>  There will be three overriding principles concerning an application for an Employment Permit of this type. Firstly, the application process and administration must be clear and approachable from the perspective of an applicant. Secondly, the employee concerned must have originally entered the labour market legally through the Employment Permits system. I do not want to create a mechanism capable of abuse or considered as an alternative to the normal Employment Permit process. Also, it is logical that an Employment Permits Bill deals only with Employment Permits matters. The third principle will be that the employee must not currently be in employment illegally &ndash; it would be counter-intuitive for an applicant to apply for a permit under one section of the Act whilst at the same time potentially committing an offence under another section of the Act.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches. <\/p><p>  Finally, in terms of the current status of the Employment Permits Bill, the drafting process is almost concluded and I envisage submitting it to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300060#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300060#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[51703\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300060#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the mechanism available to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare to obtain information regarding their former employer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>Claims in respect of statutory redundancy and minimum notice, where they remain unpaid, can be taken to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the community welfare service (CWS). <\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme includes the provision of opportunities, support and assistance to unemployed people by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with them, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The Intreo service delivery model offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and this new service model, which is more efficient in its delivery, is currently being rolled out across the country with roll-out due to be completed for all offices by end 2014.  It is expected that three hundred staff will be redeployed to these activities by the end of the year including staff from the CWS.<\/p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices. The introduction of Intreo is not intended to dispense with the CWS service but will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  <\/p><p>  The CWS play a vital role within the overall social welfare system in providing a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged.  The role of the CWS and the objectives of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme which they administer are compatible with the goals and objectives of this Department having regard to income support, social inclusion and integration of services. The need for a flexible and responsive approach to meet the needs of members of the public experiencing disadvantage continues to remain central to the CWS following its integration to the Department.  The service will also continue to provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies.<\/p><p>  To maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of their operation and to ensure continuity of service in the light of reducing resources, some 370 CWS clinics have been re-structured during the last 2 years where the level of demand for a service was low.  This included offices where limited weekly CWS public clinics were held, in some cases for only one to two hours per week.<\/p><p>  Where a closure has occurred, an increased level of service has been made available to the customers from these areas at alternative locations in the general vicinity.  The change is a move away from the traditional model of one officer serving an individual location and delivering the full range of community welfare services, towards a sustainable team-based approach which is more efficient, effective and economical.  The new arrangements have enhanced service provision, lead to greater value for money in terms of savings in respect of costs such as rent and have facilitated an improved utilisation of staff resources.<\/p><p>  Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone service is available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel, for example due to illness, including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s services are continually monitored and kept under review by management taking account of the views of staff, public representatives and users of the service to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service.  I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department.  It is therefore essential that the services provided are reconstituted to meet the changing needs of Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300060#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[51317\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on the review of a invalidity pension application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 25<sup>th<\/sup> November 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Placements","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[51320\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the way her Department defines job displacement in relation to JobBridge.

The Table below contains a breakdown by County of internships completed and internships currently undertaken.  The independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of participants progressed into paid employment.  The latest data from the Department indicate that 58% of these progress into employment with their host organisation and 42% do so with another company.<\/p><p>  In the context of JobBridge, displacement can arise where the internship opportunity being advertised is replacing an existing job vacancy or where a company terminates the employment of a staff member and then seeks to take on an intern to cover the duties previously undertaken by that staff member.  The recent evaluation report found low levels of displacement and deadweight.<\/p><p>  Where an intern moves directly into employment upon immediately finishing a JobBridge internship the cooling-off period is waived and the host organisation can re-advertise in the same area of activity.  This applies whether the intern finishes early or completes the full term of the internship.  In all other cases, the six-month cooling-off period applies from the point in time when the internship finishes, even if it finishes before the full term. Organisations who release an intern but subsequently recruit that intern a number of months later are still subject to this 6 month rule.<\/p><p>  A network of officials in the JobBridge team, National Contact Centre and local Divisions are engaged in monitoring compliance with JobBridge criteria.  The Department has conducted over 3,800 on-site monitoring visits to ensure scheme compliance. JobBridge is a voluntary scheme.  Any intern who finds that the internship does not meet their needs is free to leave the internship and may have up to a maximum of 3 internships for a maximum cumulative period of 18 months.  Interns may also report dissatisfaction with, or abuse of, the scheme or a particular internship directly to the JobBridge team via the online form on the &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; section of the JobBridge website.<\/p><p>  Of the 23,845 placements to-date, 5,192 or 22% of these placements have been in the public sector.  1,557 of these placements are currently active with 3,635 placements completed.<\/p><p>  The Indecon evaluation also found that there is a very high rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in the public sector with 41% of these interns progressing into paid employment.  <\/p><p>  In the overall context, 53% of placements are completed in full while 47% of placements are completed early.  However, it is important to highlight that 63% of jobseekers leave their placement early to take up immediate employment, in many cases with their host organisation.<\/p><p><b>  Table 1. <\/b><b><i>Breakdown of Internships By County<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Finished<\/th><th>Current<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>5,982<\/td><td>2,055<\/td><td>8,037<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>1,677<\/td><td>582<\/td><td>2,259<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>1,135<\/td><td>407<\/td><td>1,542<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>866<\/td><td>359<\/td><td>1,225<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>590<\/td><td>214<\/td><td>804<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL              <\/td><td>556<\/td><td>246<\/td><td>802<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE           <\/td><td>574<\/td><td>223<\/td><td>797<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>532<\/td><td>225<\/td><td>757<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY                <\/td><td>484<\/td><td>209<\/td><td>693<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD             <\/td><td>514<\/td><td>174<\/td><td>688<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO               <\/td><td>390<\/td><td>209<\/td><td>599<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH              <\/td><td>416<\/td><td>172<\/td><td>588<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH          <\/td><td>407<\/td><td>159<\/td><td>566<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH                <\/td><td>371<\/td><td>172<\/td><td>543<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE         <\/td><td>369<\/td><td>158<\/td><td>527<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW           <\/td><td>384<\/td><td>111<\/td><td>495<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO  <\/td><td>315<\/td><td>136<\/td><td>451<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN           <\/td><td>266<\/td><td>139<\/td><td>405<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY             <\/td><td>257<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>344<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS               <\/td><td>243<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>329<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN              <\/td><td>215<\/td><td>108<\/td><td>323<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW               <\/td><td>226<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>312<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY        <\/td><td>203<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>289<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON            <\/td><td>118<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>183<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD             <\/td><td>133<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>177<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  <\/td><td>79<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>110<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>17,302<\/td><td>6,543<\/td><td>23,845<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Data as at 28\/11\/13<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Measures","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[51321\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300061#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to the circa 2,400 jobseekers who have had penalty rates applied to their payments for failure to accept offers of education, training or employment, if any of these penalties related to the JobBridge scheme; if not, if she will provide a break down of specific training schemes and education schemes which featured in this list.

It includes the objective of progressively migrating the bulk of the Department&rsquo;s customers to electronic methods of payment, subject to satisfactory arrangements for all of the Department&rsquo;s business and anti-fraud requirements.  This is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s wider National Payments Plan which is aimed at reducing costs and improving the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  The estimated net cost to the Department of issuing a payment in cash is six and a half times more than paying to an account in a financial institution.  Clearly, with some 87 million payments per annum being issued by the Department &ndash; 50% of which are in cash &ndash; every effort should be made to drive efficiencies where they are available within our payments processes. The Payment Strategy will be published in the near future.  <\/p><p>  The progressive migration of customers to electronic payments will include those in receipt of state pension.  It is anticipated that the majority of welfare payments will eventually be made by EFT into accounts in financial institutions, but it is also expected there will be a sizeable minority that may not be able or wish to use such financial institutions or whom the Department may wish to manage otherwise as part of its control and anti-fraud measures.  Accordingly, the Strategy sets out how an alternative electronic solution will be procured to accommodate such people. <\/p><p>  The trend towards electronic payments is appreciable. Last year those customers claiming state pension for the first time chose EFT as their preferred payment method by a ratio of two to one despite the cash option being available.  Approximately half of the current customers have already opted to be paid by electronic payment directly into an account in a financial institution.  It appears from research undertaken for the Department that there is some scope for more pensioners to be paid by electronic payments.  In a survey of welfare customers, while 62% of the pensioners interviewed were being paid in cash, 81% of those customers have and use bank accounts, 69% have a credit union account and 40% have a savings account.  <\/p><p>  The first phase of implementation of the Payment Strategy has commenced with a new contract being put in place with An Post to maintain existing over the counter cash services.  This will ensure that customers, including those in receipt of state pension, can continue to receive their payments in cash at local post offices for the foreseeable future. <\/p><p>  Moving to electronic payments will require a significant effort to assist and support suitable customers over the coming years.  The Department will work energetically to help customers and their representatives in the transition period.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that customers will not be refused a payment simply because they cannot receive it electronically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK00850"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[51519\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce a supplementary allowance to allow certain persons on State old age pension to receive an allowance to cover the cost of telephone line where they have installed a personal pendant alarm; and if she will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"985","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>The overall concern of the Government in this and previous Budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence.  We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.  <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm.  Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance.  I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this.    <\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce a supplementary welfare allowance to cover the cost of a telephone line where a person in receipt of a State pension has installed a personal pendant alarm.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government operates the senior&rsquo;s alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.  <\/p><p>  It is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to <\/p><p>  1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":451,"content":"<p>Question No. 169 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[51550\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13 has been notified that their carer's allowance will be withdrawn; and if she will acknowledge that she has received an appeal against this decision.","asker":"1021","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>Payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance to the person concerned was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an assessment by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that the person being cared for is not so invalided or disabled as to require full-time care and attention as laid down in carer&rsquo;s allowance legislation.   <\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 27<sup>th<\/sup> November 2013.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. <\/p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,264 currently.  <\/p><p>The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.   <\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[51597\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300062#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite and award a domiciliary care allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 16<sup>th<\/sup> September 2013.

A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority.

There have been a total of 82 JobBridge internships with Donegal ETB, of which 36 are currently active and 46 have been completed.  Of the 46 finishers, the Department&rsquo;s records indicate that 3 of these interns went directly into paid employment with Donegal ETB.  A further 6 finishers immediately progressed into employment with another organisation at the end of their internship.<\/p><p>  The Department considers that it is important to offer interns public sector internships for four reasons: first, because, despite the recruitment embargo, there are many high-quality, real-workplace positions that can give the intern the new skills and experiences that they can use to bridge the gap to the rest of their working lives; second, because public sector internships continue to be in demand by interns who choose them voluntarily and in the knowledge of the recruitment embargo; third, precisely because of the recruitment embargo, filling those positions is certainly not displacing an employee; and fourth, because of the high rates of progression into employment with other organisations that are still exceptionally high by comparison with the Live Register in general.<\/p><p>  The independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that there is a higher rate of employment among participants who completed their internships in private sector organisations.  Encouragingly, however, 41.2% of all participants who undertook their internship in a public sector organisation progressed into paid employment.<\/p><p>  A JobBridge intern may undertake up to 3 internships for a maximum cumulative period of 18 months.

In that context, my Department seeks to promote the Irish language, to support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.<\/p><p>  It is vital that we encourage children to both appreciate and participate in Ireland's rich culture and heritage.  In this regard, my Department and the bodies and agencies funded from my Department's Vote Group provide a number of programmes, schemes and exhibitions for children and young people.  For example, in the arts area, the National Cultural Institutions provide educational services for children and young people to encourage them to appreciate the collections and also to develop their own artistic talent.  Details of these educational programmes, workshops, exhibitions and tours can be accessed through the individual web-sites of the National Cultural Institutions.  In addition, the Arts Council identifies children and young people as an important constituency, with a wide range of programmes and supports in place for both &lsquo;in-schools&rsquo; and &lsquo;out-of-schools&rsquo; activity.  Details of these programmes can be found on the Arts Council's web-site.<\/p><p>  My Department also encourages children to appreciate and explore Ireland's rich built and natural heritage.  For example, my Department's National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service operates a number of education centres around the country that seek to raise awareness of the natural world and of conservation. Such centres typically offer nature awareness programmes to primary schools and ecology and geography fieldwork to secondary schools. They may also offer special events and tours for the public. In addition, the Heritage Council run the Heritage in Schools Scheme which is unique in Ireland and provides a panel of over 165 diverse heritage specialists, who work directly with children in primary schools throughout the country, at the request of the school.  The primary aim of the scheme is to encourage awareness of the natural and cultural world that surrounds us in our daily lives and engage children in a direct experience of their heritage, preferably outside the classroom where possible and appropriate.<\/p><p>  In recent years, my Department has, in partnership with the Education Centre Network of the Department of Education and Skills, produced bespoke primary and transition year resources under the Archaeology in the Classroom programme.  The programme employs a variety of outreach tools, from continuous professional development courses to a dedicated website (  ), to raise awareness of and increase engagement with our archaeological heritage amongst both teachers and students.<\/p><p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service website,   , is an excellent educational resource and hosts a &lsquo;Monuments to Visit&rsquo; page which provides visitor information on a range of publicly-accessible national monuments.  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) website and publications are also used as educational resources by both teachers and students.   A copy of each county or city NIAH book is sent to all the public libraries and second level schools of the area in question. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also note that Irish is a vital part of the State&rsquo;s heritage and the Gaeltacht is the primary source of the living language. A core task of my Department is to promote the maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, as its most important community resource and its principal means of communication. It has long been recognised that its transmission from one generation to the next is critical for the survival of the Irish language as the predominant household and community language in the Gaeltacht. It is for this reason that my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operate a number of schemes and initiatives aimed at the maintenance and strengthening of the language in the Gaeltacht.  In this regard, a number of schemes are in operation, which assist families, children and young people to live their lives through the Irish language:<\/p><p>- Scheme for Irish language Learners<\/p><p>- Department&rsquo;s Improvement Schemes (capital grants)<\/p><p>- Summer Camps through Irish for Gaeltacht Youth<\/p><p>- Language Assistants&rsquo; Scheme<\/p><p>- Family Language Support Programme<\/p><p>  In addition, Foras na Gaeilge, an agency of the North South Language Body, is responsible for promoting the Irish language in every aspect of everyday life throughout the island of Ireland. Many of the activities of Foras na Gaeilge are targeted at encouraging young people to use Irish in their daily lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300064#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Promotion","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[51914\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which he continues to have dialogue with various local and voluntary musical societies and art groups with a view to maximising community interest in the arts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[51918\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he, his Department or bodies under his aegis have received applications for grant aid in respect of productions throughout County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 213 together.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.

These include the following cultural tourism initiatives that have been wholly or partly funded by my Department:<\/p><p>- St. Patrick's Day celebrations,<\/p><p>- Music Day;<\/p><p>- Culture Night; <\/p><p>- Arts Council support of the Arts Festivals and Events scheme, which supports some 150 small arts festivals in towns and villages throughout Ireland each year;<\/p><p>- Arts Council funding of arts centres and venues around the State, as well as the Council's funding of touring and dissemination of high-quality work in all disciplines through the national network of arts centres and venues;<\/p><p>- The Arts Council partnership with local authorities and Art Officers throughout the country;<\/p><p>- Funding of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann by my Department to support its work in the promotion of Irish traditional music; <\/p><p>- Cultural and heritage events being held under the auspices of The Gathering; <\/p><p>- Web-based projects being developed by my Department to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage for residents and visitors alike;<\/p><p>- Collaborative work with bodies and groups such as the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and Music Network.<\/p><p>My Department also operates a philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations. <\/p><p>  I would also refer the Deputy to my previous replies in relation to these matters. In January last, I provided details of the number of applications received for grant-aid and other forms of support from applicants from County Kildare and the extent to which these applications were approved. My Department's website will be updated with details of grant-aid to organisations after the year end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Philanthropy Initiatives","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[51915\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which philanthropic funding remains available for the promotion of the arts; the extent to which the future is secure in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>The <i>Programme for Government<\/i>   includes the following commitment in the area of Philanthropy and the Arts:- <blockquote><i>&quot;We will work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities&quot;.<\/i><\/blockquote>Since taking office two years ago, I have introduced a number of initiatives to address this commitment.  <\/p><p>  In May 2012 I introduced a new philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse. A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at   .<\/p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:<\/p><p>- Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;<\/p><p>- Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding; <\/p><p>- Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.<\/p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component. This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,<\/i>  which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education. In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.<\/p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts <\/i> in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity <\/i>  - which dovetails with the work in my Department. The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation. Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00650"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[51916\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which a full audit of all historical buildings, including those of architectural and cultural interest, exists; the degree to which any alterations have been made in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Any steps to be taken after 7 January, including any analysis of issues such as costs, environmental impacts and technical efficacy, will be considered then. The period between now and 7 January will, no doubt, be useful in providing EirGrid with an opportunity to reflect further on the valid concerns raised in relation to various aspects of the project. The July 2012 \"Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure\", emphasised the imperative for the State Companies, and all developers of energy projects, of early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholders.   The Statement also made clear that public acceptability requires public confidence proposals adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice. The Government affirmed that EirGrid and the other State energy companies are obliged to adhere to all relevant guidelines and standards and they act in the national interest, and on behalf of all electricity consumers. <\/p><p>  In this regard, the expectation is that those companies in making their choices, of project specific technologies and routing as well as mitigation measures, will take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level. In addition to undertaking extensive statutory and non statutory public consultation, the State Companies and energy developers must adhere to national and international standards on health, environment, biodiversity, landscape and safety as an intrinsic part of the Planning process. Compliance together with appropriate impact mitigation measures are central to the Environmental Impact Assessments which form the basis of planning applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. This includes compliance with EMF exposure limits set in International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection Guidelines and associated EU Recommendations, and Environmental, Habitat and Biodiversity national and EU legislation. The Government in affirming the broad principle of adherence to all standards, underlined the importance of the statutory and non statutory consultation processes in ensuring public and stakeholder confidence that standards are met and where necessary mitigation measures are put in place.<\/p><p>  I am aware that many people are concerned about the impact that new transmission lines and other energy infrastructure can have on the landscape, the environment and on local communities. Accordingly, it is essential that the GridLink project is taken forward on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and costs of different engineering solutions. EirGrid has stated that it will take account of all the submissions received during the course of the consultation process.<\/p><p> The Government wants to be able to give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland&rsquo;s electricity networks are robust, modern and safe. This project is a practical illustration of our collective and continuing commitment to large scale investment in electricity infrastructure, while at the same time taking in to account valid concerns and addressing them as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300065#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300066#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[51420\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300066#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the procedure that was followed for the selection of the new chairman of EirGrid.

Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.

Against this background and following receipt of the pyrite report, I engaged with the stakeholders, which included the banking sector, with the objective of securing a voluntary, industry-led response which would include appropriate funding arrangements.  However, despite protracted discussions, the stakeholders would not commit to putting in place a voluntary scheme.  In the absence of an agreement with the stakeholders the Government approved, in April 2013, the funding of a remediation scheme through the imposition of mandatory levies on the construction and insurance sectors.   <\/p><p>  Implementation of the remediation scheme was to be supported by a not-for-profit entity, established by the construction stakeholders, who would have operated under the supervision of the Pyrite Resolution Board.

Unfortunately, due to legal difficulties it was not possible to proceed on the basis of those proposals.  The revised arrangements which have recently been approved by Government do not involve a role for the banking sector.

There is a diverse array of exploitative behaviours, ranging from infringement of labour regulations at one end of the spectrum, to human trafficking at the other, that may arise in such situations. Consequently, it is likely that exploitation of this nature could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.<\/p><p><b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>In addition, the State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking including accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.

At this meeting, I tabled a paper for discussion on EU action to protect freedom of movement for EU Citizens and social integration by encouraging effective action and enhancing cooperation between justice systems in countering hate crime, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia.  At this meeting I raised the need for broad public debate and consultation process with ministries and other public institutions in Member States, human rights and equality bodies and civil society to raise awareness and understanding of the importance of the rule of law, common values and protection of the fundamental rights of all.<\/p><p>  In May 2013 a conference entitled &quot;A Europe of Equal Citizens - equality, fundamental rights and the rule of law&quot; was organised in the framework of the Irish Presidency in Dublin. This conference played an important part in the debate on how to protect fundamental rights and promote the rule of law in Europe.  The conference outlined the clear links between tackling hate crimes on one hand and promoting equality and fighting discrimination on the other.<\/p><p>  In June the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on fundamental rights and the rule of law and on the Commission 2012 Report on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  These Council Conclusions drew inspiration from the outcome of the discussions which took place at the Informal Justice and Home Affairs meeting and the Irish Presidency Conference in May. The Conclusions called, inter alia, on the Commission to take forward a debate on the need for &lsquo;a collaborative and systematic method&rsquo; &ndash; i.e. a Rule of Law mechanism or initiative &ndash; to address these important issues.   They suggested guidance to the EU Commission as to how the debate on this important topic should be taken forward, stressing the need to take a holistic approach to all the issues arising.  They also focused on the need to move forward on the basis of consensus, treating Member States on the basis of equality, working together to ensure that we achieve the standards we committed to on joining the EU and on the basis of designing an approach that will make a real difference to protection of those persons whose rights are most vulnerable to attack.<\/p><p>  Ireland remains an active participant in discussions on this issue.

In accordance with this principle, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  Insofar as penalties are concerned, the crime of rape is an exceptionally serious offence and the criminal law makes provision for rape to be treated with the utmost gravity.  Cases are heard before the Central Criminal Court and a person convicted of rape is liable to a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for sexual assault is, generally, 10 years.  However, the maximum penalty increases to 14 years where the victim is a child.  An important safeguard is the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the Criminal Justice Act 1993, to appeal a sentence she considers unduly lenient. That is a decision for the DPP who, by law, is independent in the exercise of her functions.<\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies.

My Department has been providing support to farmers since 2007 to establish the energy crops willow and miscanthus.  To the end of 2013 some 3,300 hectares of these crops have been established under the Bioenergy Scheme.

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing. ICC rules and regulations require the postponement of coursing meetings if the weather is unfavourable for example where snowfall or frost could impact negatively on the greyhound or the hare. The ICC has confirmed that a coursing meeting scheduled to take place on November 23   2013 was postponed due to heavy frost. During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of ICC clubs to provide additional food for the hares living in the wild, within hare preserves protected by the ICC.  <\/p><p>  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.<\/p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  <\/p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993\/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of  hares and greyhounds alike.<\/p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012\/2013 season. <\/p><p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective, proportionate and are working well. The ICC has demonstrated its willingness in recent weeks to postpone an event due poor weather.

During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31 October 2013. <\/p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  I have been contacted by four sets of prospective adopters who were affected by this change and who sought my assistance in this regard.<\/p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. <\/p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General was sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention. I and my officials have continued contact with the four sets of prospective adoptive parents affected by the changes in Russian legislation and who have sought my assistance in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300075#WRX02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Expenditure","counter":1030,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300075#WRX02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1031,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[51303\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300075#WRX02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 635 of 18 July 2013, which of the 41 funding bodies listed are designated as funding administering bodies which administer funding on behalf of the her Department; if she will clarify the reason 41 bodies were listed in the reply when only 31 are authorised to administer funds in this way; which funding schemes they receive and administer funds through; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been provided with funding in the order of &euro;1.4 billion this year to fund its 2013 disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities.  This represents approximately 11.5% of overall health expenditure this year.  The majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services.  There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  <\/p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  Such therapy services do not necessarily have to be delivered through specialist disability providers and are frequently accessed through Primary Care Teams and community therapy services.<\/p><p>  The Dyspraxia Association is just one of a range of organisations around the country at present providing supports to specific diagnostic groups who do not receive HSE funding.

The screening service is provided by public health nurses and area medical officers.  Children who are identified as requiring treatment or intervention are referred to the HSE ophthalmic service for follow up. Urgent cases are given priority and less urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  In Kerry urgent referrals are seen by the ophthalmic service, on average, within a one to six week period and routine referrals have an average waiting time of 31 weeks.  However, the HSE is continually working to improve the service.  The HSE has committed to providing 68,000 treatments in 2013 and it was up to the end of September 2013 4.2% ahead of target with the provision of almost 53,000 treatments to children.  I have asked the HSE to provide details of waiting lists and waiting times directly to the Deputies.<\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology aims to move towards the elimination of avoidable sight loss, to re-balance the focus on prevention and early intervention, and to provide equitable access to efficient and high quality care, supports and treatment.  A care pathway has been designed in relation to school screening and paediatric ophthalmic services. This includes the expansion of the orthoptic and optometry input into the school screening service.  This draft model of care is under consideration by the HSE.  In addition, the community ophthalmology services will also be the subject of a review in 2014 in order to ensure that the best possible service is available for patients.  I am not aware of the detail of the Association of Optometrists Ireland's 6 Point Vision Check.  I understand that it is a marketing initiative by some of its members to promote basic eye checks for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300077#WRZ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300077#WRZ02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1115,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[51357\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300077#WRZ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department and the Health Service Executive is paying for any of its employees to receive third-level qualifications; if so, the annual cost for each of the past five years; if the employee will receive a financial bonus as a result of receiving this qualification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1116,"content":"<p>My Department operates a scheme for the refund of fees in respect of post-entry education in accordance with the relevant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular 23\/2007.

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants.<\/p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits\/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).  Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan which includes this minimum suite of benefits, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. Thus, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific terms, but rather as a cohort of procedures that are important to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300078#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300079#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[51548\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300079#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will alter the system of review for medical cards in order that card holders are given a warning before cut off (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  Ordinarily, three months before an individual&rsquo;s existing medical card eligibility expiry date, a review notification issues to the individual (or parents, in the case of a child).  A review notification will indicate the card holder should be complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point. If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued.  In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.<\/p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms, at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and\/or to get back to the individuals if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished.  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed, by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client.  Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete.<\/p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards\/medical cards and subsequently the following month, and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate.  The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.<\/p><p>  To ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources the HSE also undertakes reviews of medical card\/GP visit card eligibility, whereby selected cardholders are asked to confirm that they are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Being ordinarily resident in Ireland is a prerequisite for medical card\/GP visit card eligibility.  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month and the cardholder is asked to sign and return a Declaration of Residency to the HSE.  On receipt of this Declaration eligibility to the GMS Scheme continues.  If a person does not return the Declaration of Residency form their eligibility ceases.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that each person who has eligibility to a medical card\/GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &rsquo;valid to&rsquo; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.  Notwithstanding the &lsquo;valid to&rsquo; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility, at any time, and take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder no longer fulfils the criteria for eligibility under the Medical Card \/ GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300079#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300079#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[51551\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120300079#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical card will be approved in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and the reason for the delay with same","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

In the context of the employment control framework numbers employed in the health service must be further reduced.  While it is a matter for the HSE to determine the composition of its staffing complement, it is important not to underestimate the significant role that management\/administrative staff play in the direct support of front line services. <\/p><p>  Administrative staff ensure that the service runs as smoothly as possible, for example staffing ED reception, organising OPD clinics, processing medical cards, collecting income due, managing the health service budget and paying its staff.  Managers are essential also in such a complex system and those earning over &euro;100,000 have taken the biggest reductions in recent years, while shouldering substantial responsibility for the delivery of essential services and functions at national and regional level.

Shortly after that,\u00a0two further EPIRBs from the same manufacturer were identified as defective. Following contacts with the manufacturer by my officials,\u00a0the\u00a0three units were sent to the company&rsquo;s plant in Australia. A fourth unit was subsequently identified as being defective and it too was sent to the manufacturer in October 2013.<\/p><p>  My Department engaged closely with the manufacturer and at the end of October the manufacturer informed my Department that an analysis had shown a micro processor within the unit to be defective.

The new system is designed to deliver several administrative benefits for operators, including online booking systems, reducing the vehicle paperwork to be brought to the test and centralised issuing of the Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW).<\/p><p>  From 7th October 2013, a new annual fee, which includes a road safety levy,\u00a0was introduced.\u00a0 The RSA consulted industry on the reforms and the planned road safety levy in November 2011 and the actual levy is lower than that proposed in the public consultation.\u00a0 There have been a number of awareness raising measures of the reforms over the summer months and the new fees were advertised in national newspapers on 3rd October 2013 and are available in full on the RSA website.<\/p><p>  The levy is also funding enhanced supervision, enforcement and compliance measures being introduced at the roadside and at operator premises.
