I will not take very much time.  We made a written submission to the committee and are very grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on a subject that has preoccupied us for a number of years.  During that time we have been measuring the costs of going back to school and have published our survey year after year.  Every year we say the same thing - this is a very frightening cost.  In recent years it has been very clear to us from our direct experience that parents are going into unmanageable levels of debt over what ought to be a constitutional right for their children.  Our most recent survey indicated that it costs in the region of &euro;355 to start a child in senior infants; &euro;390 for a child in fourth class and &euro;770 for children going into first year of secondary school.  That is the cost of books, uniforms and some absolute basics.  It is not the cost of designer labels and all the other things parents are under pressure to provide.<\/p><p>  Earlier this year when the budget was published, we said, as I believe all of us would agree, we thought it was shameful that the support available had been cut as drastically as it has been, namely, cut by a third in one budget for both primary and secondary school students, while it has effectively been halved for primary school students in the most recent budgets.  Coming here today, we would love to ask for more money to be put into supporting families with these massive costs.  We know that is not going to happen.  What we would like is for this committee to do what can be done without increasing costs in order to make some things more affordable than they are at present.<\/p><p>  In our view, there is a fundamental deficit of leadership in this area.  One of the committee members said to me earlier that the problem with the education system in Ireland is that we fund the system but do not control it.  Perhaps he did not see it as a problem but I do.  There are some things that need to be controlled.  For example, a school book rental scheme should be mandatory.  If money is given to school principals they must be under absolute injunction and direction that the school book grant cannot be used for any other purpose.  The voluntary code that currently exists among school book publishers should be made mandatory.  There should be much stronger leadership than there is to direct boards of management to review their uniform policies.  In Northern Ireland, for example, very detailed guidance is sent to every single school.  Although I understand this is not mandatory it is far more persuasive than anything that goes out from the system here.  There must be public policy in these areas.  With a little bit of imagination and a little bit of, for want of a better word, lateral thinking, some of the heavier burdens can be removed from parents.  Those things are simple to do and do not cost any money.<\/p><p>  We know of schools where parents are leading by designing and running the school book rental scheme and where principals support them they are making real progress.  In my view the policy should be that parents should be encouraged and allowed to lead and principals should be encouraged and, if necessary, obliged to support this work.  Concerning school books and uniforms it is absolutely possible to make the kind of changes that would save families a lot of money.  I would love to see and would argue for more financial support but I know it is a waste of everybody's breath to do that in the current climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800003#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368015000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Deane to speak on behalf of Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800004#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368015000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We will closely echo what Mr. Finlay has said because we work very closely with Barnardos and the National Parents Council - both primary and post-primary.  I will start with some terribly stark statistics.  It will come as no surprise to anyone in this room to discover that a quarter of all children in the country come from a household that does not have a job.  Half of families rely either on a social welfare payment or low-paid work with consequences for children growing up with that degree of deprivation, exclusion and needs - as opposed to wants.  Unfortunately we have the old reliable statistic of one in ten children living in severe poverty, which is basic deprivation.  That is tough on the children and when they go to school it becomes compounded.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to appear before this joint committee because as we said to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, since 2009 some &euro;450 million has been taken out of child income-support payments and we in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul through our 10,500 members are very concerned.  We witness on a daily basis what that does to a family with the erosion of hope, the degree of insecurity, stress, anxiety, hardship and the constant \"No\".  We are talking about little ongoing costs of participation in school.  For us this is not just a back-to-school issue, this is an all-year-round issue, involving things like the cheque for the swimming or the football boots.  While participation on the GAA field can be the cheapest of all hobbies to get them out and about, a child cannot get near it without the kit, mouth-guard etc. - a child might end up looking like the Michelin man at the end of it all in order to get out there and play and be like everybody else.  This applies to curricular activities.  Swimming is on the national primary curriculum, but must be paid for.  Children whose parents cannot pay end up stuck in another class while their mates go off and have a bit of craic on those days.<\/p><p>  We are talking about exclusion and a deeply divisive commoditised education system in this country.  I am sure members have read the survey from two days ago, which informed us - we did not need to hear it, but it is good to have evidence - that those from private schools do better because their parents can afford to buy commoditised privilege of educational resources.<\/p><p>  Members may read our submissions which are all very similar and will drive home the same message that for many parents and households the cumulative reductions in social welfare supports and schemes and the continued cost of education are just too much for people to bear.  I will not read out my submission which contains nice colourful pie charts indicating what our members shell out to people for schoolbooks and uniforms.  This is keeping families afloat and we are very concerned about it.  Our organisations have been at the forefront of trying to create solutions to this problem.  We are looking to our elected Members to find ways of doing the job better - doing the right job the right way.  As Mr. Finlay has said, we want parents to be partners.  I have many copies in my bag if members want them.  I would be quite happy to distribute them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Audrey Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1368015000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Ms Deane could do so when she finishes speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800004#F00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368015000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We want parents to be partners in education.  We agree with Mr. Finlay of Barnardos and are quite appalled at the level of autonomy schools have.  Up to &euro;60 million of taxpayers' money goes towards schoolbooks to be dealt with in any discretionary way that a principal may see fit.  There is good practice and bad practice.  In some cases children are parading their poverty and in others there are very innovative, comfortable, confidential, discreet ways of doing things.  There is a spectrum of ways of doing things, but it should not be like this.  This is a small country with a limited number of schools.  Let us just get on with this and find some solutions to this problem.  As far as we are concerned, parents need to be a partner and do not need to continue to be at the receiving end of notes in schoolbags stating it will cost &euro;450 for this iPad, &euro;600 for this, &euro;200 for that or whatever.  This is not the way to have an adult partnership relationship when it comes to providing education for our cherished children.<\/p><p>  All our organisations proposed solutions to the Minister on the issue of schoolbooks.  We accept and we are party to the implementation of the guidelines, but we do not believe they go far enough.  School principals cannot continue to have autonomy over whether to establish a schoolbook rental scheme because too much money is at stake.  We are quite unhappy at the continuing frequency of additions and changes.  We accept the publishers were forced into a new protocol but we know they continue to do deals with schools.  Prior to the introduction of the protocol they had already different discounts for different schools.  We do not believe that represents the way forward.<\/p><p>  The schoolbook market is worth &euro;60 million and we are not trying to reduce jobs or be anti-growth.  However, we believe we need ministerial leadership to show there is a way that will be parent focused and not profit focused or publisher focused.  We need to see some real solutions there and we want to be part of that.  Until very recently there was a hands-off approach on the part of the Department of Education and Skills and it is not enough to throw our hands collectively in the air, ask what we can do and say that schools can decide what they want to do.  That is not a viable option.<\/p><p>  We are also very concerned that in the parent body there is a low awareness that taxpayers' money is going into schoolbooks.  To date they have not had much understanding that they really should be asking school principals why they do not have a schoolbook solution.  We understand that there are - particularly from our Labour Party colleagues - some ideas around this.  We will stand beside them and work with them<\/p><p>  Uniforms represent another large expenditure which does not need to be the case.  It is good that all of our organisations got together with all the other leader organisations in education - some 13 organisations in all.  We put our heads together and came up with a very simple two-page document to request school boards of management to review the school policy.  This is solution focused and represents partnership working in action.  I was lucky enough to meet the Minister for Education and Skills on his way up the stairs so he has a copy in his briefcase as we speak.  This is the way to work in future - find solutions, work collaboratively and get to the outcome we want, which is less expense for parents.  It is over to the members of the committee and we look forward to working with them in the future on these most important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800004#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Audrey Deane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368015000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>In our preparation for this submission we surveyed parents to establish the issues they had.

Some 60% of parents who responded said their schools had a schoolbook rental scheme available for all parents.  Of those 60%, some 90% said they were utilising it.

The National Parents' Council Post Primary is a voluntary organisation with 20 directors, who give of their time freely, and one full-time staff member.  While I may be at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to other witnesses, I represent an organisation whose members are at the forefront as parents.  The major issues we deal with are similar to those mentioned by other speakers.<\/p><p>  The first issue is the cost of uniforms.  We have been involved in a campaign aimed at reducing the cost of uniforms because, while we appreciate that uniforms distinguish schools and have to be worn, we need to consider more generic and less costly alternatives.  We have heard crazy figures, such as skirts costing up to &euro;90.  That day is long gone.  This issue needs to be driven from the top down.  As a parent body we are powerless unless we have support from the top.<\/p><p>  The cost of schools books has long been a major issue.  We began to campaign on it in 2011 with our partners and managed to get publishers to introduce a code of conduct.  However, we feel the code is very porous and as parents we are simply dictated to and required to take what we are offered.  If a school requires books costing &euro;200 parents must buy them if they want their children to be taught there.  I am not being disrespectful to teachers when I say teachers pick the books and parents pay for them.  In what other part of Irish society is that the practice?  I respect teachers as educators, however.  <\/p><p>  A relatively new publisher claims to have saved parents &euro;15 million in the last three years and estimates that it will save them a further &euro;100 million over the next seven years.

I also thank them for offering suggestions as to how the Government might take some action to assist in alleviating the problem that exists.  There is an onus on the committee to take this matter up with the Minister directly and to ask that the Department take more decisive action to adopt some of the practical proposals put forward by our guests.  What they are seeking has been sought in the past but, unfortunately, action has never been taken.<\/p><p>  The presentations contained a number of common themes.  The issue of schoolbooks was particularly prominent and was referred to by all our guests, especially in the context of cost.  Two or three suggestions were put forward in the context of the banning of workbooks, a requirement for compulsory book rental schemes in all schools and more input on the part of parents.  Reference was also made to the 23% rate of VAT which applies to e-books - this are being used on an increasing basis - but which does not apply in respect of printed versions.  When commenting on the survey carried out by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Ms Deane stated that 64% of school uniforms must be purchased at specialist stores.  That figure is remarkably high and it is not acceptable.  This is a matter which the committee needs to pursue.<\/p><p>  The key difficulty which arises relates to the fact that one quarter of students come from homes were no one is in employment and that half have parents who are either on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments.  The main issue is that we have been reducing the supports provided to the families who are experiencing the greatest degree of financial pressure at present while increasing the demands on them at school level.  Although we are focusing at this meeting on the reduced level of supports available, we must also consider the reason schools are placing more demands on parents.  A study was carried by Am&aacute;rach Research on behalf of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA, in respect of the funding crisis being experienced by schools.  It emerged that as this crisis becomes more pronounced at school level, the onus is increasingly being placed on parents.<\/p><p>  The back to education allowance has been cut significantly in the past two years, from &euro;200 to &euro;100 at primary level and from &euro;305 to &euro;200 at secondary level.  This has placed real pressure on families who cannot find the money from elsewhere.  In addition, the summer works scheme which was used by schools to carry out certain refurbishment projects has been discontinued.  Last autumn, the minor works grant was also discontinued.  Some schools managed to absorb this particular cut in funding, which was worth a minimum of &euro;5,000 to each school.  The grant in question would have fallen due for payment in the latter half of this year and a real funding crisis is going to emerge at primary level, in particular.  As stated, the grant was worth &euro;5,000 to each school.  In a school with 50 students, families are going to be obliged to find an additional &euro;100 each in order to make up the shortfall.  In a school with 100 students, the shortfall per head will be &euro;50.  Who is going to pay this money?  Again, the onus will be placed on families.  That which I describe does not often garner the same type of prominence and coverage as direct cuts to the supports provided to families.  There have been calls for voluntary contributions, etc., to be banned.  However, they reason such contributions are requested is because the funding for schools is continually being squeezed.  One way or another, the responsibility in this regard is always placed back on the shoulders of parents.<\/p><p>  There is a need to ask the Department to reconsider the position regarding the supports it provides to schools and in respect of the impact cuts to funding are going to have on parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800006#H00300","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368016800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will not repeat much of what Deputy McConalogue has said because while there is a common theme among those working with parents and those working in this area, such as Barnardos and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, there is also a common theme on this side in terms of recognising that there is a need to address it.  On the one hand we have a Minister, Department and Government which are cutting resources, including the back-to-school allowances and capitation grants, while on the other hand the Government is washing its hands of some of the possible solutions to try to offset the costs of schools for parents, and that is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the cost of school books.  I have spoken to several principals and patron bodies about this issue.  I believe patron bodies have a responsibility in all of this as well.  Often the patron body gets lost in the debate on back-to-school costs and it is left to the Department and the school board of management, but the patron bodies have a major responsibility to take the lead on this issue and I do not believe they are doing so.  We need to say that much loud and clear.<\/p><p>  Schools that do not have book rental schemes maintain that they would prefer to have such schemes but that the problem is the significant start-up costs involved.  Do the delegations have any comment on that or any experience of it?  I imagine the National Parents Council Primary is dealing with schools which may not have official book rental schemes in place but may have alternative arrangements, or perhaps its representatives have spoken to parents from schools that do not have these schemes in place.  Will the delegation outline the reasons behind this?  One point we frequently hear is that a significant start-up cost is involved.  Once a scheme is up and running, those involved can manage it, but the difficulty is to get a scheme up and running.  Do the delegations have any solutions to or opinions on that?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to voluntary contributions.  Let us face it: they are not really voluntary contributions.  We all get the letters.  I have children in primary, post-primary and higher education.  We get letters from my daughter's post-primary school.  After reading them one is under the impression that if one did not pay, she would not get a place next year.  There are letters seeking to process the child's enrolment for the next academic year and there a request for a voluntary fee of &euro;120 needed by 1 May.  It is not needed by the following September but now.  This must be addressed.  Ms Lynch put the case rather well about the ongoing costs, which are astronomical.  These are the costs associated with drama, swimming and no-uniform days.  Every week there is something costing either &euro;10, &euro;15 or &euro;20, especially in post-primary education.  In primary education these costs may not arise on a weekly or monthly basis, but in secondary schools there are continuing requests for money, whether for Christmas tickets or Easter draws or whatever, and parents are struggling to budget for these costs.  Many parents will know that there are uniforms to be got before going back to school and they will try to budget as best they can.  However, once the child starts back in school, the ongoing costs are sometimes not budgeted for.  They can come out of the blue and these costs are causing parents to struggle.<\/p><p>  One submission - I cannot recall which - reported on how parents come up with the money to fund back-to-school costs.  The figure for those going to moneylenders was given as 1%.  This seems a remarkably low figure.  From my experience of dealing with people in my constituency offices and from speaking to parents, it seems a decidedly low figure and I am unsure how accurate it is.  My own experience is that the number of parents who go to moneylenders to make up the shortfall involved in sending their children back to school is considerably higher than 1%.  That is a frightening development, the likes of which we are seeing more of now, especially cases in which parents are being forced into the hands of illegal moneylenders with all the attendant dangers.  I question that particular statistic in the report.<\/p><p>  Mr. Finlay put it well when he said there is a fundamental deficit in leadership in this area.  There is no doubt there is a fundamental deficit in leadership but it cannot be put solely at the foot of the Minister.  All of us, as legislators, must take responsibility for that.  I believe there is a need to make the voluntary code of practice mandatory.  More can be done on the issue of uniforms but the patron bodies must buy into that process as well and more pressure must be put on them.<\/p><p>  I am unsure whether making the school book rental scheme mandatory would work now because of the initial start-up costs.  I call on the delegations to respond to that question.  I would be keen to hear the ideas of the delegations.  Is the initial upfront start-up cost a genuine reason for schools not having a school book rental scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800007#J00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368016800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>We do not have to do it immediately.

Naturally, we need to consider the capacity of the parent to pay, but fundamentally we should ask why these costs are there in the first place.<\/p><p>  We have always had the problem of the cost of sending a child to school being unnecessarily high.  When we had money, we did not focus on this issue properly.  During the boom times we made other political priorities.  There is a cultural question at issue.  As Mr. Finlay rightly noted, we should go back to the Constitution and the value of having a free education.  We have lost the sense of that ideal.  Perhaps we need to have a discussion among ourselves as a society about that cultural shift.  The idea of holding a fund-raiser for a Garda station sounds ridiculous but we have no difficulty holding a fund-raiser for a school or a hospital.  People in Scandinavian countries would find that rather bizarre.<\/p><p>  Part of the problem is the nature of competition between schools.  The value system that underpins our education system is one of choice, and that is fair enough.  However, it leads to a level of competition between schools.  My school must offer something the neighbouring school does not have, because I need a certain enrolment in my school to keep my staff complement as it is.  I would not be keen to lose numbers to the neighbouring school and, therefore, I may prioritise a nicer jumper and the ability to offer X, Y and Z.<\/p><p>  I do not understand why we stand over a system that puts pressures on parents to fund outings such as ski trips.  When did the idea of a ski trip become an integral part of the educational journey that a person needs to travel during secondary school?  These questions have to be asked but there are more fundamental things we need to discuss.  I was quite taken by what Ms Lynch said about the fundamental relationship between the parent and the school being undermined, because it is increasingly becoming a financial relationship rather than one based on education and learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800007#J00800","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368017400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for coming before the committee and for their presentations.  I worked in retail for 24 years before I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I had a shoe shop.  I have seen all perspectives on uniforms and school shoes.  It is a closed shop when it comes to school uniforms and shoes.  One hears from people in the retail trade that they have a school on their books which they facilitate with school uniforms and they have the whole market to themselves.  On a few occasions I tried to get some information on clothing to determine whether I could mix clothes and shoes, but found I could not enter the market because it is a closed shop.  The school supports a shop and they work in tandem.<\/p><p>  In Northern Ireland one can purchase a crest or badge and multinationals co-ordinate with schools.  Uniforms are chosen which everyone, including multinationals and local shops, can get.  Whoever has the best prices gets the business.  Multinationals do not carry huge stock, and therefore individual shops also get trade.  In the Republic, there are different colours, shapes and makes, and it is a closed shop.  People in the trade are making vast sums of money.  One trader told me he earns enough in the six to eight weeks of back-to-school trade to keep him going for the whole year.<\/p><p>  As a Deputy O'Brien said, uniforms no longer comprise trousers and a geansa&iacute;, rather there are sports elements.  People with three or four children could spend a couple of thousand euro in a shop.  That could be multiplied many times.  I wish the best of luck to such shops but we need open trading in this sector.<\/p><p>  One issue raised by Mr. Myers was the 23% VAT rate.  There was a Revenue crackdown on the shoe industry.  Children's shoes are zero-rated and adult shoes have a VAT rate of 23%.  Most shoes come in carton lots of 12 and 14 because they are made in the Far East.  Deck shoes with white soles have become very popular - they are called \"Dubes\" - and cost &euro;100 a pair.  Such shoes start at size 36 and go up to size 42.  A 36 is a size 3.  Most shop owners thought that shoes up to size 5.5 were zero-rated, but the Revenue Commissioners said once a range goes from 36 to 48, all sizes are ratable at 23%.  Children's feet grow, and eight, nine or ten year olds wear size 7, 8, 9 or 10 shoes, which are all rated at 23%.<\/p><p>  If we do anything as a result of today's meeting, we should examine whether the Government can do anything about having an exemption from the 23% for school-going children.  It would be a huge saving.  If one has to buy runners, shoes and football boots for four or five children, the extra 23% VAT is significant.  Mr. Myers brought memories of the VAT rate flooding back.  Revenue did audits and then left shoe shops because it was worried about the negative publicity it would get.  However, we were told that once shoes came in cartons with sizes from 36 to 42, we had to charge 21%, and then 23% when the rate increased.  It is a major issue for people buying shoes for children going back to school.<\/p><p>  In one school with which I am dealing, if one does not pay the voluntary contribution, one does not get a key for a locker.  Children who see others without keys know they have not paid, which is an horrendous situation.<\/p><p>  There are a lot of sole traders and self-employed people.  I was self-employed and came before this committee, as other members can confirm, to push for an effort to look after the self-employed.  The comments on the grant system for back-to-school requirements are correct.  Many sole traders are not surviving and we need to consider helping them in terms of back-to-school grants.  The laws on social protection have been loosened a little and sole traders are receiving payments, but it is still an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800008#K00200","speaker":"1079","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368018000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Deputy is out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800009#L00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1368018000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am sure the Chairman will allow me to finish this very important point.

Several members referred to the status of book rental schemes and how that cost can be allayed.  My personal view is that if the school book publishers all closed down tomorrow and no new primary school books were published, I am not sure the education system would change at all.  This is because, in the first instance, the curriculum was written to facilitate a lesser degree of reliance on school books.  The bottom line, however, is that there are already enough books in the system.  When one considers the number of children who finish primary school every year, the question arises as to where their books are going.  Schools must have some means of retaining those books within the system.<\/p><p>  The fundamental difficulty in this regard is the regularity with which the assigned reading list changes for individual classes.  I am referring here not only to what the book publishers are doing but also the tendency of some teachers to change the reading list for their class, sometimes year on year.  That has to stop if schools are to be in a position to offer a workable book rental system.  Any such scheme requires consistency in the books that are used each year.  As I said, there are probably enough books in the primary system to implement any model of school book rental scheme.  I am not even sure why there is rental element to it; if the books are there in the schools, they can be given to children.  Year on year, however, parents are purchasing yet more books and one is left wondering where this huge pile of books is accumulating.  It does not seem to add up.<\/p><p>  It does not take too much thought or innovation to work out how to keep the books we already have and recycle them within the system.  Any such scheme should not be too difficult to initiate because of the massive numbers of books already in circulation.  Coming from the English system, I am constantly amazed at this phenomenon of new books being purchased every year.  We often hear about a revised edition of a particular textbook replacing the older version on the assigned book list.  Again, coming from the English system, it was my experience that in such cases the teacher would instruct pupils with the older edition to open on page 42 and those with the newer version to turn to page 44.  That was all the variation in teaching that was required to accommodate a class where pupils had different editions of the same text.  There are lots of issues blocking the changes we are discussing but, in my view, there are enough books in the system to facilitate any scheme that might be introduced in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800009#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1368018000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Lynch.

In some schools parents have a say in those types of decisions, but in more schools they do not.  It is perhaps going too far to say they are dictated to, but in many cases parents have little say on these matters.  I spoke last night with a person whose child will go into first year in September.  This parent has received a request from the school for &euro;100, comprising &euro;50 for the book rental scheme and a &euro;50 contribution to running costs.  The letter states: \"The additional &euro;50 annual contribution is to cover costs such as student journals, personal accident insurance, locker rental, photocopying, newsletters, school reports and telephone and postage communication with parents\".  Any parent receiving such a letter will be given pause for thought.  It could certainly be argued that it is ultimately down to the patron to step up to the mark on such issues as school uniform costs.  After all, the board of management is acting on behalf of the patron.  As such, it is not really feasible for any patron to claim it has no control over what the board does.<\/p><p>  In regard to iPads and other communications devices, we have fought vigorously in regard to costing.  The bottom line is that iPad devices are working out at approximately &euro;500 apiece.  We are arguing over school books costing &euro;450, yet at the same time we are talking about a device that costs &euro;500 before one purchases a single book.  A sense of perspective is vital in this discussion.  We have gone down the road of Android devices, which are half the price, and one publisher has even got into QR codes.  There is certainly a momentum in this regard.<\/p><p>  Ms Lynch made a vital point regarding the number of books in the system.  At post-primary level, publishers are telling us that only a tiny percentage of books are updated every year.  Yet parents tell us the costs arising from the incidence of new editions is crippling.  All of the costs are falling back to parents.  I endorse everything that was said by my colleagues in this regard - we are getting hammered.  Parent associations were not set up to engage in fund-raising for schools.  That was never their intended purpose and that is the message we must drive home.  The function of parent associations is to allow parents a role in seeking to address difficulties that arise in the running of their children's school and to offer suggestions for improvements.  We are willing to play our part in whatever way we can, but there is little we can do without support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800009#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Don Myers"},{"type":"speech","time":1368018000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Myers.

We have spoken to the Minister about the degree of practice within the publishing sector.  We cannot go into it too much on the record, but there really is a lot of reform needed there.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is seeking a clear message from the Minister in regard to the leadership he will offer on this issue and his strategic intent to regulate the industry.

Deputy O'Brien mentioned the start-up costs associated with school book rental schemes.  My answer to him would be that there is a need for investment of the school book grant as the start-up fund.  In my experience, because we set one up in my school, the principal was proactive in it and gave us the pot of money that he received as the school book grant to enable us to start it up.  As Ms Lynch correctly states, between setting up those grants and getting the books back within the system, if that grant is reinvested over time it shifts the paradigm, from the parents funding the cost to the school providing the books.  It is a system that operates in many countries and it should be operated here.  The school book grant scheme is the vehicle to get us to that destination and we need that vision to get us there.  There needs to be buy-in from all communities, including principals, patron bodies and parents, towards school book rental schemes so that there is no stigma attached to a school book rental scheme and it is available in all schools.<\/p><p>  Correspondingly, in the case of school uniforms, there is a role for the Department of Education and Skills and patron bodies.  It is not acceptable that such a hands-off approach of the school uniform being dictated by local boards of management.  The Department and patron bodies have a role to play and we need to challenge that.

It would be a conscious decision to scrap all of the other items of school uniform that require that crest on it.  It should be floated as an idea.<\/p><p>  On the other issues, digital books or e-books certainly came up in the Barnardos survey last year.

It was interesting what Deputy Butler stated about the shoes.  My daughter is eight.  She has her first communion on Saturday and I am still trying to buy shoes for it.  I went into a shop of one of the named brands and it stops its children's range at size 3, and she takes a size 3.  I wonder is she into adult shoes at eight years of age.  I suppose there is an issue that children are now much bigger.  It is not only my daughter.  It seems to be a phenomenon.  They are growing very fast, probably, more so than in the past.<\/p><p>  There is a couple of issues.  One matter a member of the public raised with me was that the book rental scheme does not cover matters such as art materials and that discriminates against those who might be interested in art.  There may be comments on that.<\/p><p>  I note that in some schools it does not seem to be a voluntary contribution when they send out notes looking for payment, for example, for art materials, computer material or whatever.  Some schools are bending the rules considerably.  In that regard, the committee visited Finland where schools are not allowed charge fees.  They are also not allowed bend the rules for voluntary contributions or by holding fund raisers.  The other point is that everything is paid for in Finland.  Ms Tinsley spoke of a cultural shift.  There is a more egalitarian society in Finland.  One can see it across the board.  All of the members were really impressed that it seems to infiltrate.  Even when one speaks to politicians on the left and right, they all talk about equality.<\/p><p>  Parents are represented here because most of us are parents or have family with children, and the parents council is represented here as well.  Parents play a role.  Recently, I was at a talk where a principal of a disadvantaged second-level school spoke of how he wanted to attract middle-class parents to try to achieve a better mix in the school - I suppose the idea was to bring everybody up in the school - and he succeeded.  One of his approaches was to bring in a school blazer.  That was one of the ways he attracted middle-class parents.  Parents play a role in this.  It is not as though they are innocent actors.  There are parents affected by this but there are also parents playing a role in driving the need for expensive-looking uniforms, etc.  Are there any other questions or comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800010#M01000","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1368018600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The issue of competition between schools is a driving factor in many of the unnecessary burdens that are placed on parents.

They could become part of a funding committee in a school to examine shortfalls, but the relationship between parents and schools must change from being a dialogue of finance to one of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013050800011#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1368019200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The committee will produce a report which will include recommendations, and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is our rapporteur.

I would like to open by giving an overview of the European and international dimension to the work of the council.  As we are now in the fifth month of our Presidency, I would like to take the opportunity to brief members on some of our key dossiers and achievements, while discussing the agenda for next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, after which I will be happy to take questions and observations from committee members.<\/p><p>  In terms of the process, I am sure members are aware that the focus of ECOFIN is heavily influenced by the economic and fiscal backdrop, the work of the European Commission and the guidance of Heads of State or Government, who meet regularly in European Council Summits in Brussels.  Into the mix, it is the job of the six-month rotating Presidency to guide and steer the debate.  Our priorities are clear and have been shaped by the need to bring stability to a fragile and somewhat volatile economic and financial situation, as well as to pursue policies that will underpin growth and jobs. <\/p><p>  As President of ECOFIN I have chaired three council meetings so far in Brussels, as well as representing the council at various bilateral and multilateral meetings with the EU Commission, European Parliament, G-20 Finance Ministers and social partners.  We have made significant progress at these meetings and I will say a little more about that later.  In addition, in April 2013, I hosted a very successful informal meeting of ECOFIN in Dublin, where political agreement by EU Finance Ministers was reached on extending the average maturities of EFSF and EFSM loans by seven years for Portugal and Ireland.  In addition, we had a good discussion on enhancing long-term growth prospects as well as how we might enhance long-term financing, including in the context of SME funding.  We also had a good discussion about some taxation matters.  As I am in the Chair representing the Presidency, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Brian Hayes, takes the Irish seat at these meetings for the six months. <\/p><p>  Turning now to the ECOFIN meeting next Tuesday, I understood that this committee has already received the draft agenda.  Members will see that it is a very full agenda.  I now propose to outline the key issues that are likely to arise, while taking into account that some of these may change on foot of ongoing work at official level in the meantime.  Indeed, the draft agenda members have in front of them has already changed since the one circulated late last week.<\/p><p>  The ECOFIN meeting will begin on Tuesday with an informal breakfast meeting during which Mr. Herman Van Rompuy will meet with the Finance Ministers to tell us more about what he is planning for the next European Council meeting.  The formal ECOFIN meeting will start with a discussion on current legislative proposals including the draft banking resolution and recovery directive. <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency set out an ambitious programme in financial services.  The priorities on the financial services files for the first half of the Irish Presidency were based on the priorities set out in the December European Council conclusions, including agreement on a single supervisory mechanism, the capital requirements directive and on banking recovery and resolution.  We also undertook to progress work on the markets in financial instruments directive.  Our strategy has been to pursue a strict prioritisation agenda and to focus resources on the most significant dossiers. <b><\/b>This has been a successful strategy and we have made considerable progress to date with agreement on two of the key banking union files, namely the single supervisory mechanism and capital requirements directive.  On the consumer side, the mortgage credit directive has also been concluded.  We plan to continue our efforts to advance discussions on the banking resolution and markets in financial instruments directive files.  We are making progress on these and hope that we can advance matters on banking resolution during this month.  <\/p><p>  The discussions on Tuesday will then move to tax issues, including the savings tax directive and savings tax agreements.  We undertook to progress all of the above tax dossiers in our Presidency programme and there have been a number of significant developments to date on them.   The January ECOFIN meeting saw agreement that the financial transaction tax could be introduced in the 11 member states which have signalled they wish to enact the measure.  A formal Commission proposal for a directive implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transaction tax was published in February 2013.  Ireland, as members know, is not one of the participating countries but we are committed, in our role as President, to act as an honest and impartial broker in the discussions.  Council working party meetings on this issue are ongoing. <\/p><p>  At the informal ECOFIN meeting in April, there was a useful discussion on recent developments in the international tax area on tax fraud and tax evasion, including the pilot initiative announced by a number of member states under which they will work more closely together and automatically exchange tax information.  I expect that this issue will be also addressed by President Van Rompuy at the breakfast session before the formal meeting begins and I expect that there may be a short discussion around that.  Work has been ongoing at council working party level by officials on measures to prevent VAT fraud and these are due to be discussed further at the next ECOFIN meeting.  My expectation for the May ECOFIN meeting is that there will be agreement on the negotiating mandate to allow the Commission to initiate discussions with third countries on the savings tax directive.  It is intended that tax anti-fraud issues will be discussed at European Council level at its next meeting later this month.  <\/p><p>  Our Presidency programme also sought to ensure the effective implementation of the European Semester process which included agreement on the &ldquo;two pack&rdquo; of economic surveillance measures and to work towards a more effective Economic Monetary Union through supporting the development of a time-bound road map for further economic and fiscal governance measures and some of these items feature on Tuesday&rsquo;s agenda.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800003#B00200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368027600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank him for that comprehensive opening statement.

This type of bail-in was applied in Cyprus following the failure of the initial proposal to impose a levy on those holding less than &euro;100,000 on deposit.

This group will then take the process further.  There are differences of opinion among member states on this matter and for this reason nothing has been fixed yet.  We took possession of a Commission paper on the issue and produced a Presidency paper.  The resolution framework is designed to deal with all types of bank problems, including insolvency.  The directive simply sets out the order of creditor preference.  It represents an improvement on the current position in this country for depositors where they currently rank on a par with senior bondholders.  If we had another case of a bank going bust, as occurred with Anglo Irish Bank, the first people at risk would be the shareholders whose money would be burned.  Subordinated or junior debt would be next in line to be burned in accordance with the requirement on banks to either pay their creditors or return to solvency.  The next in line would be senior debt, of which there are several categories and, as such, a hierarchy.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will recall from his party's time in government, all the advice to my predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, was that senior debt and deposits rank <i>pari passu<\/i> under the law.  That remains the advice to me.  This means that senior debt and deposits are on the same line if one is organising the hierarchy of credit in the bank.  The Irish Presidency's proposal, which may or may not be agreed as there are different views on it, is to give deposits preference and thereby place senior debt above depositors in the hierarchy.  If accepted, the proposal will improve the position of depositors in the banking system.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will recall that there is a bank guarantee in place across the European Union which guarantees deposits of up to &euro;100,000.  Given that no such guarantee applies to deposits above this figure, this means in theory that deposits of more than &euro;100,000 are at risk in every European country.  To return to the old debate, one of the reasons the European Central Bank would not allow the Irish authorities to move against senior bondholders was that, according to the advice available at that time, to do so would have required them, by law, to move against depositors outside the guarantee because senior bondholders and depositors were on the same line.  It was a policy matter with the European Central Bank not to touch senior bondholders on the understanding that such a course of action protected all depositors.  If there were to be a bail-in, we will seek to provide additional protection to deposits, even those in excess of &euro;100,000.  This means depositors would be ranked below senior bondholders in the hierarchy.  The Deputy should note, however, that we are discussing an extreme scenario, one where we have a repeat of the Anglo Irish Bank case.  Separating the sovereign from the banks removes the risk to the taxpayer but means some risk would accrue to depositors, albeit at the end of a long line.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800005#D00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1368028200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Where would the direct recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism sit in that process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800005#D00800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1368028200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>That matter is being negotiated.  Ireland is one of the countries that has resolution legislation in place.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty participated in the debate on the bank resolution Bill and will recall that it establishes a fund by means of a levy on the financial institutions.  The first step on the European policy of resolution is to have resolution mechanisms in place in all eurozone countries, some of which still do not have the relevant legislation in place.  Once this is done, each eurozone member will have a fund.  The next step will be to establish a fund at European level.  Whether this fund could be used to recapitalise banks as well as resolving them or such a function would be one for the European Stability Mechanism or both funds could be used as a source of recapitalisation, has not yet been decided.<\/p><p>  What has happened on banking union is that commitments have been made in principle.  Furthermore, the Irish Presidency has succeeded in securing agreement with the European Parliament on a single supervisory mechanism.  Having got that bit across the line, we are working on the resolution issue.  While most of the detail has been agreed, agreement has not yet been reached on the hierarchy for the bail-in mechanism I have described, starting with the shareholders.

A clear pattern has emerged in the downgrading of growth forecasts and upgrading of the projected increase in unemployment.  It is that the austerity experiment, which was first tried here and subsequently extended to Greece and Spain with disastrous consequences for all three economies, is now being applied across Europe where it is having a similar effect.  Evidence that these effects are beginning to impact on Ireland in a manner that was entirely predictable is provided by the most recent figures from the purchasing managers index, which show that manufacturing employment and output in Ireland have recorded their largest declines in four years.

When I studied economics in UCC, one of the first things we were taught was that income must equal expenditure.  The most misunderstood quote in Europe currently is that Europe is moving away from austerity.  This does not mean that countries that have excessive deficits are moving away from having balanced budgets, but perhaps it is about encouraging European countries that have a large surplus, which have been very restrained about how they put money into the economy, to start spending.<\/p><p>  On a different issue, it now seems certain we are not to be part of the financial transactions tax that is to be implemented in 11 member states, many of which are in the eurozone.  Does the Minister see that as the end of the matter?  Is there a potential benefit for Ireland due to the fact that many of our competitors or friends within the eurozone will now have a tax on financial transactions while we will not?  With regard to tax unity within Europe and the taxes being discussed, can I take it that these do not concern issues such as corporation tax and that such issues are not on the agenda currently?<\/p><p>  There is one other issue I wish to raise, but I will come back to it later if we have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800009#H00500","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1368030600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>We had a discussion on the financial transaction tax at the first meeting I chaired in January in Brussels.  There is a legal power within the treaties whereby if a group of countries wants to advance a particular policy, it can move ahead under what is called enhanced co-operation.  Some 11 countries signed up to follow that route.  That is only the start of the matter, not the end of it, because they must now come together, engage with the Commission and bring forward a policy document which reflects the consensus view.<\/p><p>  The discussion on the financial transaction tax is not just among the 11 who have signed up for it.  Everybody participates in the discussion, even those of us who did not sign up to it.  In the treaties, it is made very clear that any measure taken by way of enhanced co-operation cannot interfere with the Single Market.   I note the UK Government has already signalled that in respect of the financial transaction tax it may take legal action, because it thinks it may interfere with the Single Market.  Therefore, there is many a hurdle to be cleared before there is a financial transaction tax.<\/p><p>  As far as we know from proposals made in France, Germany and Austria, which were made separately from the united front they are now showing, they are talking about something akin to a stamp duty on transactions.  We have that already.  We have a 1% stamp duty on transactions on shares.  The UK, although the biggest objector to a financial transaction tax, has a 0.5% duty.  If the tax is something along those lines, it will not really matter.  However, I presume the tax will be extended beyond the buying and selling of shares into other financial instruments.  Our position is that if a financial transaction tax was introduced by the G8 at its meeting in Enniskillen and it applied everywhere in the world, we would have no problem with that.  However, our difficulty is that if we had a financial transaction tax and the UK did not, activity would move from Dublin to London.  With regard to whether it would be an advantage to us if the other European countries went ahead with it, any advantage would be marginal.  If something was done in the United Kingdom, that would be an advantage, but while we are in the same space as London a financial transaction tax would make very little difference.<\/p><p>  On the other tax issues, on Tuesday we will discuss &ndash; and I think we have agreement on it &ndash; a mandate to provide information on non-national deposits in banking systems.  We want to negotiate with five non-European countries on the provision of information - Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco and one other.  We will make progress on that.  Those who were holding out on that were Luxembourg and Austria, but during the week I had conversations with the finance Ministers of both countries and we have moved them along, so they will now move on that.<\/p><p>  With regard to corporation tax, a Commission paper remains extant with regard to a common base for corporation tax, but there is a wide disparity of views across the Union on that policy paper.  I do not see significant progress towards a decision.  There will probably be discussions on the issue, but none have been planned for the Irish Presidency.  The issue may arise towards the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800009#H00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1368030600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>On the changing of the hierarchy with respect to debt, will the Minister address the issue of whether there is a danger this will drive up borrowing costs?

He asked for observations and questions.  I will make one observation and then put some quick questions.  I strongly support the Minister&rsquo;s position on the primacy of deposits.  It seems like an odd thing.  It does not pass any common sense test that people who put a few quid in the bank should be on a par with professional investors.  I fully support anything the Minister is doing there.  It would be great to see some detail on how that algorithm might work.  Will shareholders go first and, if so, then what?  Will it be a 50% cut for junior creditors or a 20% haircut to senior creditors or a 5% cut?  It would be interesting to know whether the plan is for senior bondholders to take a full hit and only when they are exhausted would there be a move on to depositors.  Will there be a sharing but less of a haircut for depositors because of their primacy?  I full support what the Minister is doing in this regard.<\/p><p>  We were at the conference in Brussels yesterday on the blueprint for the EMU.  It was very interesting and one thing that struck me was that there were people there from the Commission, the Parliament and the ECB.  There was great confidence in the new tools of which there are many, including the six-pack the two-pack, the competitiveness instrument and many other new tools.  It struck me that there was some group-think going on.  There was almost an over-exuberant confidence in these tools.<\/p><p>  One of my macroeconomics professors was a man called Jeff Frankel.  He said to us on our last day at our last lecture that everything he was teaching us was wrong.  This man used to advise Clinton and he was on the economic management council.  He was a smart cookie.  His point was that macroeconomics is in its infancy.  He said that five years previously the material he was teaching to his students was different from what he taught us and that five years on it would be different again.  The point was that if one wishes to stay on top of macroeconomics one must keep upgrading one&rsquo;s knowledge and changing the modelling and so forth.<\/p><p>  Given the amount of detail and scorecards and so on, the way Europe seems to work is that once we get these things agreed, it is rather difficult to secure change because there are 17 or 27 members.  It is simply an observation for the Minister to consider for ECOFIN.  He may wish to emphasise that these things must be flexible because the banks will always find ways of getting around the metrics.  While I broadly support some of these tools - there are some good ideas contained in them - I do not see any provision for flexibility, such as, for example, annual reviews or reviews every two or three years to determine whether the banks are managing to circumvent what we are trying to measure them on.  They will put a vast amount of resources into doing exactly that.  That is simply an observation for the Minister.  Some flexibility in how that is supervised in the coming years would be very useful.<\/p><p>  The issue of pensioners being wiped out in IBRC is a conversation for a separate day.  I realise it is nothing to do with ECOFIN, but part of it is relevant.  I gather a decision has been taken by the liquidator that the pension funds, which were deposits in, for example, a six-year deposit account, are not covered by the deposit guarantee schemes.  That is something to bear in mind.  Does the Minister agree with that position?  Will the Minister be representing the view at ECOFIN that pension funds, even if they are not strictly deposits, should be covered by the European deposit guarantee scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800010#J00400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1368031200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his observation and comments in support of the changes which the Irish Presidency is advocating on where in the hierarchy of deposits over &euro;100,000 should fall.  That is important.  The second observation related to economic and monetary union, how it has developed and the over-enthusiastic confidence of some of its supporters.  What we really have is a series of elements that Deputy Donnelly has described and which in their totality come close to a full fiscal union, because they are all rules about budgets.  Rather than looking at the parts, if we look at them together they represent fiscal union.  The difficulty I see is that we want to ensure that they are implemented as drafted.  We had the Stability and Growth Pact previously.  Then, when France and Germany exceeded the limits it was not applied.  It seemed to amount to rules for small countries.  If we want to go back to the start of the problems in Europe one could base them on the non-implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact in 2002 or 2003.  This is one of the reasons that people like Wolfgang Schaeuble is so set on having things done by treaty.  He wants to be able to have these matters enforceable in the European courts.  He always says that he prefers a treaty, that is his position.  That is why we had to go through the stability and growth treaty we put through in May 2011.<\/p><p>  I agree with the observations of Deputy Donnelly.  The Deputy referred to the need for flexibility.  The way the conservation is developing at official level and at COREPER in advance of Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting is that a group of countries are looking for more flexibility.

I too would like to make a few observations and then ask one or two questions.  The observations follow from the blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU conference yesterday to which Deputy Donnelly referred.  One thing came across forcibly to me, especially from the first session which was introduced by Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, followed by Olli Rehn, Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Victor Gaspar both finance Ministers whom the Minister will meet next week.  The point was developed in Sharon Bowles's presentation.  She is always first class because she is robust, has clear thoughts and clear expression, using language we can understand.  That is in contrast to Mr. Barroso's presentation which was very turgid, very foggy, aspirational, full of hypothetical language, abstract ideas and disconnected from the world and the Europe in which we live.  In the Europe in which we live there are 20 million people unemployed which is a very serious situation and derives, as is now admitted, from banking messes across the eurozone.<\/p><p>  The Cypriot and Irish banking messes are actually quite similar.  They both arose from the collapse of asset values on their balance sheets.  In the case of Cyprus these were Greek bonds which were unrealisable and therefore there were losses.  In the Irish banks it was loans to the property, housing and construction sectors and other businesses which collapsed causing losses.  Mr. Yves Mersch, who is an executive member of the board of the ECB, also gave a presentation.  By a slip of the tongue he said that the cases of Ireland and Cyprus were different because in Ireland's case it was a bailout and in Cyprus it was a bail in.  In fact the ECB must have been conscious when our system was collapsing that it needed to do something to avoid the domino effect of the contagion that would assuredly have happened.  The mess was left in Ireland and with the people of Ireland.  That is wrong.  I made that point in the break-out discussion that followed and it can be seen in the recording of the conference.<\/p><p>  I said it was wrong that &euro;31 billion of losses in the case of one bank should have been converted into loans to that bank to redeem bondholders and the residual financial damage was inflicted on the Irish people.  This was done circuitously, through a promissory note which re-inflated a busted bank.  After that explanation to the 500 people present there was a strong round of applause, not for the fact that I had said it but because the knowledge had come into the debate in clear and understandable English.  That is what we thirst for in Europe.<\/p><p>  There will be an opportunity when we have the stage next week to explain these things.  The banking system is still buckling at the joints across the eurozone and in the developed countries of the financial world.  Sharon Bowles, who is on the finance and monetary committee, agreed that they are only beginning to understand the amounts and scale of balance sheet and off-balance sheet contingency liabilities in the shadow banking world and in the exposures that the traditional banks have off-balance sheet.  These are very big, through re-hypothecation of financial securities and assets, which are being re-mortgaged four and five times, especially in London where some of the people who understand this and take the trouble to try to measure and assess it are quite scared by the scale of what is going on there.<\/p><p>  Let us go from those general principles and observations to where we are at in our own case.  It looks like there will be further bank recapitalisation.  That is not a strange suggestion to anybody who is honest in their thoughts.  The reason is that the mortgage loan losses are only now being acknowledged and recognised.  Fiona Muldoon told us about the SME difficulties, of &euro;50 billion of loans half are under stress and impaired.  The figure for losses in the banking system started off at &euro;23 billion.  Had that been adhered to the banks would have just about been kept out of State control.  I got my date wrong.  It was on 17 September 2009 that I presented the previous Minister for Finance with a grouped balance sheet of the six banks and an eight page document describing what had gone wrong in the loan to deposit ratio.  That is the ratio across the eurozone that showed all the banks that failed and continue to fail and just about survive how it went wrong.  That is the doom loop between banking and sovereigns because banks take on the bonds that sovereigns issue and when they are not collected or their yields go high and their values fall their balance sheets start buckling.  It will take people with a bit of mental stature to stand up and explain these things in easily understood English and not using all the hypothetical, abstract words, long sentences and polysyllabic words that have obfuscated and caused fog.  We want clear home-grown language such as Sharon Bowles uses.<\/p><p>  I have two questions, first, how much capital do our banks need?  Provision has been made against the transfer of &euro;16 billion in loans from IBRC to NAMA.  What are the existing provisions and what more will be needed because I do not believe they will be collectable at the net book values of the loans?  Today there is an interesting article by Martin Wolf, which <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times<\/i> has reprinted from the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, in which he examines what has been happening, led by the biggest economy in the eurozone, Germany, and why its rigid adherence to the chosen path of deficit control and insistence that there be a pan-European solution is inherently contradictory, cannot work and ought to be stopped.  It is a very readable article and I commend it to the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned on our own patent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800011#K00500","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1368031800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The Deputy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013050800011#K00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1368031800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>This is the last question.

We were scheduled to discuss an initiative on its elimination on Tuesday but it has been deferred, probably until the June meeting.<\/p><p>  The European authorities are focusing on tax evasion because of the savings directive I mentioned and countries like Lichtenstein, Switzerland and so on.  As a result of their rules on confidentiality and secrecy, they prefer to pay a withholding tax rather than reveal information about deposits from non-nationals and their banking systems.  They are now moving towards transparency.  Those holding out were, as I said, were Austria and Luxembourg.  I spoke to both Ministers during the week, and they have now agreed to move and change the mandate.  The mandate is for the Union to negotiate transparency rules with the five non-EU states which are used for tax management purposes.  We are making significant progress on that.  <\/p><p>  On the EU budget, there are two budgets, one which stretches to 2020, which the Taoiseach discussed with the T&aacute;naiste on Monday in Brussels, and a supplementary budget to pay the bills for 2013.  The Parliament has tied the two together.  What is up for discussion on Tuesday is the budget for 2013.  The agreement between ourselves and the Commission is to aim for a figure of &euro;11.2 billion.  It is like a Supplementary Estimate.  Some other countries - the creditor countries - think the amount is too high.  <\/p><p>  We want to establish the principle in order that we can engage with the Parliament on the wider issue as well as the supplementary budget.  We want them to agree the principle of splitting the &euro;11.2 billion and suggested a figure they could agree to, for example, &euro;7 billion, and revisit it later in the year and agree the remaining figure.  We think by splitting it that way, they will have agreed to the principle of a supplementary budget and the drawdown of a significant amount of it.  Otherwise, there will be a hangover that will run into 2014 and there will be increasing difficulties.

Others will say that when the pendulum of regulation swung from soft touch regulation, it swung too far, too fast, and that there is now over-regulation in the Irish financial system.

I am very honoured to have been invited to discuss enlargement policy and the European neighbourhood policy.  As members are aware, this is vast when one considers all the countries involved and the very heavy EU workload.  I will try to be concise, while touching on all of the main issues.<\/p><p>  The 27 countries soon to be 28, countries of the European Union have led the way in creating a framework for close cooperation between nations, in establishing a basis for friendly relations in our neighbourhood.  As you will know, Ireland currently holds the Presidency of that Union, an opportunity the Irish Government and the people have always valued.<\/p><p>  The Presidency has allowed Ireland to demonstrate that we are a constructive and committed member state that belongs at the very heart of the European decision-making process.  We are now over halfway through our term and we remain firmly committed to ensuring that our seventh Presidency leaves a positive, strong and lasting legacy both for the EU and for Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Presidency, as expected, is turning out to be eventful for the EU's enlargement policy.  Croatia is due to join the Union on 1 July.  We have been working to reinvigorate the accession negotiations with Turkey.  The pace is picking up with Montenegro.  Last month we received the Commission and EEAS reports on Serbia, Kosovo, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  At this point in the Irish Presidency, I am hopeful of the prospects for the EU enlargement policy in the months and years ahead.  The last monitoring report on Croatia issued by the Commission on 26 March was very positive, confirming that Croatia is generally meeting the commitments and requirements arising from the accession negotiations.  The General Affairs Council on 22 April adopted conclusion commending Croatia for the results it achieved and l look forward to welcoming her as the 28 member state of the European Union on 1 July.  Croatia held its first European Parliament elections on 14 April to elect 12 MEPs who will represent its citizens in the Parliament for the 12 months leading up to the European elections of 2014.  The process of ratifying the accession treaty for Croatia is advancing well and I am very confident that it will be completed on time.  This will allow us very soon to conclude what has been a long journey - one that began ten years ago.<\/p><p>  The agreement reached last month between Serbia and Kosovo allowed the Commission and the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, to issue positive reports, which were considered by the General Affairs Council on 22 April.  Discussions are only just beginning among the EU members states but I hope that by the end of June we may be in a position to agree to proceed to the next step in the accession process for each country.  For Serbia it would be opening accession negotiations and for Kosovo opening negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which are two of our key enlargement priorities in the Irish Presidency programme.  Implementation of the agreement will be key to ensuring a positive decision by the Council.  I hope that will materialise in June.  I welcome the fact that High Representative Ashton will continue to facilitate discussions on implementation over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The General Affairs Council also gave consideration to the Commission's report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<b><\/b> The report was relatively positive, though recognising that more work is required.  Again we plan to return to this in June.  As well as the name issue, the political situation will be a consideration.  Following the events of 24 December, I welcomed the agreement the political parties eventually came to which allowed the municipal elections to proceed.  Further engagement with and respect for the political and democratic process is required.  It is important that all leaders of the country demonstrate the political courage required to put the country's strategic priorities ahead of narrow party political interests.<\/p><p>  For the countries in negotiations, we are hopeful of being able to open a negotiation Chapter with Turkey<b><\/b>during our Presidency, which would inject new momentum into that country's accession process.  While the EU-Turkey relationship goes back a long way, it has not yet achieved its full potential.  We are therefore working hard to encourage further progress, although this will also require significant effort from the Turkish side.<\/p><p>  Negotiations with Montenegro are at an early stage but we were pleased to open a negotiating chapter last month and we hope to be in a position to open another one in June.  Attention is also being paid to the rule of law chapters that the negotiating framework for Montenegro puts into effect the new approach, which sees progress achieved on the rule of law chapters linked to overall progress in the accession negotiations.<\/p><p>  Iceland is already well advanced in the accession negotiations.  In advance of the elections, which took place last month, the Icelandic Government took a decision to slow down the accession negotiations.  All EU candidates have of course the right to pursue the negotiations at a pace which they deem appropriate to their particular situation.  The Icelandic Government has throughout this process has acted with the utmost transparency on all its dealings on the accession process.  I hope to see the new Icelandic Government decide to continue with the negotiations, however it will be for the new government to decide on how it wishes to proceed.<\/p><p>  Turning to the prospective candidates, there are three countries that have an European perspective but are not yet official candidates.  I have already mentioned Kosovo, for Albania the Council stands ready to consider granting candidate status when the Commission reports that necessary progress has been achieved.  Progress has been patchy in recent months and it is unlikely the Commission will be in a position to deliver a report during our Presidency.  The elections are due on 23 June and of course they are a factor in this process.  It is of crucial importance that they are free, fair and transparent and needless to say the Council will be looking closely at that.<\/p><p>  Bosnia and Herzegovina<b><\/b>is now lagging behind its neighbours, and this is an issue of concern.  The Bosnian Government and political leaders must make real and substantial progress in order to realise the country's EU perspective.  What is required is clearly laid out in the December Council Conclusions, and in the June 2012 roadmap agreed by the Commission and Bosnia Herzegovina's leaders.  Unfortunately, the timetable for implementing the roadmap has already slipped.<\/p><p>  This lack of progress is frustrating.  While we do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<\/p><p>  The European Neighbourhood Policy, ENP, was developed in 2004 with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and 16 neighbouring countries to the south and the east.  The aims of the policy are to strengthen prosperity, stability and security in the EU's neighbourhood.  The policy covers 22 of the EU's closest neighbours.  These include six to the east, the so-called Eastern Partnership - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine; and the 16 countries of the Mediterranean and North Africa, which form the Union for the Mediterranean, Algeria, Bosnia, Croatia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, <font color=\"#222222\">Mauritania<\/font>, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Arab League.  Libya, which has observer status, has recently been asked to join also.  The Union for the Mediterranean is the only forum which brings together both Israel and the Arab states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800003#B00200","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368021000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive account of what is happening in Europe at present, particularly with enlargement, the eastern partnership and relations in the southern neighbourhood.

Apart from Croatia, is it expected any other country will accede to the EU during the time of the next multi-annual financial framework, which lasts until 2020?

At this stage it is pretty certain that Croatia will join the EU on 1 July.  There were some legacy issues that had to be resolved before the ratification could take place in the Slovenian Parliament.  That has happened.  I am pleased to say we were able to play a constructive role as Presidency in ensuring that.  There are no likely difficulties with ratification.<\/p><p>  One cannot put a time limit on accession.  A country will only receive a date for accession after it has gone through the entire negotiating process.  Quite frankly, the accession process is more complicated and demanding of potential member states than it was in the past.  That is no bad thing.  We can look on it as a positive in terms of the credibility of the process.  Of course, the candidate countries can find it frustrating but I think they recognise and understand that we must get it right.  I cannot put a timeframe on the accession of Turkey, Iceland, Serbia and other potential candidate countries.  The negotiations will go at their own pace.  Often it is up to the candidate countries in terms of how quickly they wish to embrace the reform process.  As I noted in my introductory remarks, the Croatian process took ten years.  It is not a quick process.  With the additional burdens associated with the negotiation process, it will take some time for any of the countries I have mentioned.<\/p><p>  I mentioned that Croatia has already held the elections for the 12 seats in the EU Parliament.  In light of the cap on the number of seats in the EU Parliament, which is set at 751 seats, it means that some countries will lose a seat.  At present the proposal from the European Parliament - and this was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Parliament both in plenary and committee - is that Ireland, along with a number of other countries would have their number of seats reduced by one.  It is likely to be finally decided upon by the European Council, but that is the likely outcome.  It is our expectation.  It is highly unlikely that the Council would overturn a very strongly endorsed recommendation of the Parliament as this is ultimately a question of the composition of and future of the Parliament in light of the various restrictions that apply on foot of the Lisbon treaty.<\/p><p>  On the question of the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, a point also raised by Deputy Crowe in the context of the neighbouring countries, the humanitarian effort is not simply focused on Syria and is focused instead on all of the neighbouring regions.  When the T&aacute;naiste was in Turkey, he visited some of the camps in the bordering region and, unfortunately, those camps are in a number of neighbouring countries.  The situation is quiet dire.  The EU is playing a significant role in providing education, shelter and food for all of the affected refuges, particularly children.  There have been challenges in terms of accessibility, in particular within the borders of Syria, but those are being overcome.  There is a major effort being led by the European Union, supported by all of the member states and other international actors.  That is a major priority at present.<\/p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the Arab spring and the question of women's rights.  When we talk about human rights and fundamental freedoms and the sort of democratic changes that we are seeing in the Arab spring countries, the very heart of the issue is equality and women's rights and all the rights and freedoms that we expect and enjoy in the democratic free world.  It is at the core of our discussions, negotiations and all our bilateral contacts with all of the Arab spring countries.  It is a very firm focus.  I suppose the fact that the High Representative for the European Union and Vice President of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, is a woman is an important matter and it sends a very strong signal in terms of who is representing us.  I think it is very positive.<\/p><p>  In terms of Turkey, there have been significant improvements in terms of relations with the Kurdish minority and the PKK.  The ceasefire has been widely welcomed across the European Union and beyond.  This helps to strengthen and improve relations with Turkey.  There is a long way to go but it is very brave and courageous step on both sides and it is very important.<\/p><p>  There are other reforms that are happening and need to continue.  We need to see momentum, whether it is freedom of press, freedom of expression and association or whatever.  There are major challenges but we have seen positive developments and I expect that will continue.<\/p><p>  The issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is frequently raised in this committee.  I know that a range of interesting and expert speakers from the region and people who have expertise in the region have come to speak at this committee.  I visited there last summer, and at that time, we had reasonably high hopes because the high level dialogue was under way and was beginning to show some concrete results.  There was a clear timeline in place.  Unfortunately, the nature of the political situation and the local elections interfered with some of the progress we expected to see.  As I said in my opening remarks, Bosnia-Herzegovina has fallen behind in the implementation of the roadmap that has been agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800006#E00200","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368022200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I will not rehearse any of the issues I raised with the Minister of State yesterday.  I congratulate her, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach on the excellent way in which they have guided the European Union during Ireland's Presidency to date.  There is no doubt that Ireland, a small nation with a population of 4.5 million, is doing an exquisite job in the context of its Presidency.<\/p><p>  I listened with great interest to the Minister of State's presentation.  Of all the countries and regions to which she referred, there are three with which I am disappointed.  Sadly, I am most disappointed with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Consider, for example, how the people there suffered in the past and the fact that Croatia will become a full member state of the European Union in July.  In addition, Serbia has made concessions, acknowledged the role it played in Srebrenica and softened the tenor of its relationships with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  Both Croatia and Serbia are moving forward and Kosovo has taken a number of phenomenally progressive steps, particularly in light of the Serbs there being informed by Serbia that Kosovo is now their country and that it will not be intervening on their behalf.  Bosnia-Herzegovina is the bad news story here.  I am of the view that we should renew our efforts to assist it.  Belarus is just Belarus and I will say nothing further about it.<\/p><p>  What is happening in Syria is horrendous.  I am extremely disturbed by the US position on Syria and its suggestion that the opposition there should be armed.  This is particularly alarming in light of the fact that there has been a preliminary finding to the effect that the latter has been using chemical weapons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800007#F00200","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368022800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That was a fantastic Second Stage speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800008#G00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1368022800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>We are discussing a big world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800008#G00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1368022800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Not too many questions were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800008#G00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1368022800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I did not mention Armenia or anywhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800008#G00500","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1368022800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her presentation.

The 1.3 million Libyan refugees are primarily located in Jordan, Turkey and Greece, countries that are themselves in development.  Greece is facing its own difficulties.  We should recognise the fact that, since the refugees' homes are gone, there is no basis for them to return.

They are all very welcome.  <\/p><p>  The second Global Irish Economic Forum was held in October 2011.  It provided an opportunity for members of the Government, along with Ministers of State, representatives of the Opposition, senior officials from Government Departments and State agencies and leading members of the Irish business and cultural sectors to meet directly with many of the most influential members of the Irish diaspora and discuss Ireland's priorities for economic renewal, job creation and the restoration of Ireland's reputation abroad.  <\/p><p>  When this committee met the T&aacute;naiste after St. Patrick's Day 2012 to review the progress of the forum, he told us that to be successful the forum must be able to demonstrate its contribution towards Ireland's economic regeneration.  We look forward to hearing today what progress has be made on the key outcomes and what remains to be done.  <\/p><p>  The more than 300 members of the global Irish network who are valuable partners in the Global Irish Economic Forum are just one part of the story of the Irish diaspora.  It is very important that we continue to prioritise the plight of the many undocumented Irish in the US.  Their status leaves them in a legal limbo which affects their lives in many ways, whether it is their ability to get secure employment or travel home for family funerals.  Addressing this issue and reforming our migration arrangements with the US are important priorities for the Government, and I am sure members of the committee will be interested to know what work is progressing, that is, what is being done by the Irish abroad unit and our embassies and what is happening in Washington, in particular the immigration reform Bill in the US Senate.<\/p><p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.

I am pleased to appear before the committee this afternoon to discuss the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and embassies and consulates abroad in support of Irish emigrants, and more broadly, in engaging with the Irish diaspora.  I will focus my initial comments on current issues facing the Irish abroad, in particular the undocumented in the US and on the follow up to the last Global Irish Economic Forum.  Much of this work is co-ordinated by our Irish abroad unit and I am joined today by my colleagues Mr. Joe Hackett, director of the unit, and Mr. Karl Gardner, the deputy director.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say that for as long as Ireland has had a diplomatic network, the Department and its network of missions have always worked closely with Irish communities abroad.  This work took on an even closer and more practical character following the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants in 2002.  This report led to the establishment in 2004 of a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish abroad unit, whose task was to help address the needs of our most vulnerable emigrants and to provide policy support to the Government's engagement with the diaspora.  Since then, the unit has been fortunate in the strong bipartisan support and assistance it has received from the Oireachtas and this committee.<\/p><p>  Members will be aware that globalisation and communications technology has changed, in a significant way, the nature of the debate surrounding diaspora engagement.  From a position whereby our people abroad were considered as distant and separated, international discussion now revolves around building mutually beneficial partnerships with these communities, which help to support a strong connection by addressing the needs of those communities in their new homes, and also by drawing more actively on their knowledge, experience and goodwill.<\/p><p>  Ireland is not alone in this objective.  Other countries, such China, India and Singapore, devote increasing thought and resources to harnessing the potential of their diasporas.  I am pleased to say, however, that Ireland has remained to the forefront of this work.  Whether in delivering peace in Northern Ireland, spurring economic development, raising awareness of our culture or creating a positive brand in their adopted homes, we are fortunate to possess a global Irish presence which makes an ever more valuable contribution to Ireland.<\/p><p>  Today, our diaspora engagement policy has two key strands.  First, through the emigrant support programme, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries to provide support to Irish emigrants.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front-line services to those most at need, including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million.<\/p><p>  In line with recommendations made by this committee, we are engaging with communities which are receiving larger numbers of new emigrants such as those in Australia and Canada.  In Canada, we support the new Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto, while in Australia, the main welfare bureaux in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane all secured additional funding in 2012. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368024600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Burgess.

Is the Government seeking to ensure that those resident illegally in the US prior to that date  can apply for their pathway even if they were deported?  Unlike the other 12 million people who did not happen to get caught in the intervening period, will there be a process whereby those who were unfortunate enough to be caught and deported can apply for a pathway to citizenship?<\/p><p>  The US Government has offered a future flow of visas on a number of occasions.  For Ireland to secure a future flow of US visas, we need to offer a reciprocal arrangement for US citizens who want to live in Ireland who, as members will be aware, find it difficult to obtain right to residency here.  What are the officials' views on that?  They are dealing with the issue day in, day out.  What is their sense of how this will play out?  What timeline do they envisage?  Could a deal be in place by Christmas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800012#L00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368025200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I will deal with the first question the Chairman asked, which brings in some of the other issues raises, and I will go back then to see if I have left anything out.

Everyone acknowledges that there are very good grounds for optimism this time around.  That rests on a number of factors.  The first is that this Bill has been carefully crafted on a bipartisan basis in the US Senate and is sponsored by four Democrats - Chuck Shumer, Dick Durbin, Bob Menendez and Michael Bennet - and four Republicans - John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake.  We also know that there is broad support among figures in the Republican Party for immigration reform.

The idea is to prevent a surge of illegal immigrants in the period immediately beforehand.  As Senator Daly was speaking I had a look through our analysis of the Bill and I do not see that point specifically addressed but I expect the cut-off date will be maintained and enforced once the Bill is passed into law and once that law is embodied in regulations.<\/p><p>  We have a variety of figures for the numbers of undocumented Irish in the US but none of them are reliable.  There have been estimates made in different parts of the US.  There have been some estimates for New York.  A number of factors make it difficult to get a firm fix, one being the mobility of undocumented around the US.  Another is the seasonal dimension of flows to and from the US.  We have always taken the figure of 50,000 or lower as the approximate figure but we do not have a finer sense of that.  This is something we may come to but we work with a number of Irish centres in the US and those centres have a clear sense of the numbers in their immediate communities but one of the features of recent immigration to the US has been that many recent immigrants are far more diffused across the US.  We have been working to support Irish networks, a network of Irish networks for recent immigrants across the US.  That went very quickly, over the space of the last two or three years, from three or four networks in the major cities to 14 networks across the US.

For some years, I have been raising the issue of tourism promotion through parliamentary questions.  Ireland has a great and rich history and culture, which is of international interest, especially in the United States whose citizens visit this country in numbers.  To what extent can we use the Global Irish Economic Forum as a means of advertising our rich history and culture and encouraging people to visit?  Some of our archaeological sites date back 5,000 and 6,000 years.  People flock to sites throughout Europe that are 2,000 or 3,000 years old.  In my constituency, we have an example of a built structure - a round tower - that is more than 1,000 years old and has stood the test of time.  It is a great example of what Irish people were able to do with little technology all those years ago, especially was we were not subject to the Gothic and Romanesque influences to which the countries of central Europe were subject, although we subsequently copied them.  We should show these great examples of our culture, heritage and architecture to students, young people and visitors.

If this is an example of fresh thinking, it is to be welcomed.  Figures are available which show the value to the economy of every overseas student.  Not only are foreign governments funding the accommodation of students who come here to study, but they are also providing them with pocket money during their stay, which lasts for one or two years.  Clearly, if one increases the number of overseas students studying here, one will add value.

We are currently recruiting abroad to meet some of the skills shortages in the technology sector, which appears to indicate a lack of foresight in our educational system.  While I accept it is not easy to predict exactly where jobs will arise, a gap appears to have emerged in this regard.  I hear much discussion and hype about The Gathering.  While I admit it is a good initiative, it is also a transient one in that its benefits will be felt this year only, with perhaps a small spillover into next year arising from the advertising campaign.  With one quarter of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 years unemployed, we clearly need a much more productive approach to the area of employment.<\/p><p>  I note that a number of private equity companies are focusing on Ireland.  These are primarily funds that wish to invest in property because they believe the sector will deliver significant profits in future arising from the property crash.  While it is easy for the media to criticise many of the entrepreneurs who were involved in the construction industry, they provided a large number of jobs.  Unfortunately, much of the profit that will be made from the depressed property market will be repatriated to other countries through the involvement of private equity companies.  Some minor efforts appear to be under way to persuade private equity companies to put together enterprise funds to invest in small and medium-sized enterprises with a view to generating jobs and growth.  Efforts to provide good mentoring and management can be as beneficial as financial supports.  Donald Keough, the former chief executive of Coca Cola, was instrumental in the company's decision to invest in Ireland.  He thought all the investment should be focused on Wexford, from where his ancestors came, and we now have a Coca Cola plant in the county.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800014#N00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368027000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The Global Irish Economic Forum was probably one of the best initiatives of both the previous Government and this Government in terms of our reaching out to our diaspora abroad.

Resources were not given to the Department of Foreign Affairs to do all that was laid down by the first and second global economic forums.  I refer to interdepartmental committees.  If the witnesses do not have the answers they might send them to the Chairman.  There was an interdepartmental group and an advisory and implementation group for the Global Irish Network, for which the T&aacute;naiste was responsible.  How many times did it meet?  It is very difficult to get different Departments together to move issues forward.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach was to examine the form of the outcome and make progress reports.  How many times did that happen?  Seed funding was one of the suggested outcomes, a good idea that was based on the experience of other countries such as Israel, which had microfinancing.  How much money was given out in this area?<\/p><p>  The Global Irish Economic Forum was a wonderful initiative.  Many people from around the world were willing to come to Dublin and give their time and effort.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has much to do already, was asked to do a monumental task, one for which Israel has its very own department.  Our diaspora is larger than the Israeli one yet the Department of Foreign Affairs is obliged to do not only what a completely separate department in Israel does but also all the work of the Department must do on top of that.  Given the situation in the North, a separate department is almost required to handle that as well.<\/p><p>  It might be an idea if somebody was to benchmark what was promised two years ago and point out how many meetings there had been, even down to the updates.  That was one of the suggestions that came from the Global Irish Economic Forum.  Were those who came kept informed and told that in the past month such and such has happened?  I do not believe anybody wants to get an e-mail every month but there should be one every two or three months outlining what progress there has been.  My fear is that an excellent concept, one which the Department does very well in trying to administer, is simply under-resourced in terms of the manpower required to be able to meet all the requests made of it after the first two forums.  If the Government does not properly resource the Department, if people do not see the outcomes they were hoping to achieve and are not kept informed, they may not come to the third or fourth forum.

Deputy Crowe raised the question of numbers of emigrants to Canada and Australia.  We have more detailed figures for these two countries than for the United States.   For Australia, 25,827 working holiday visas were granted last year, with 645 Irish nationals granted a student visa.  Some 4,500 Irish-born people became permanent residents of Australia through that country's skills programme.  Canadian figures show 6,680 Irish people entering Canada as temporary foreign workers, with 5,350 entering under the working holiday programme.  As members may know, there is a new extension and an expanded working visa scheme in Canada which, from granting 6,000 visas this year will increase to 10,000 visas next year.  This year, all 6,000 visas were taken up quickly and we expect a full uptake next year as well.  That gives a sense of the numbers for Canada and Australia.<\/p><p>  A few points were made about The Gathering and I will take them together.  Critical to the success of both The Gathering and the expansion our tourism take every year is access.  That infrastructural point of access comes up repeatedly.  For example, there are no direct flights to the west coast of the United States.  Embassies are constantly active on this point but for the airlines the considerations are commercial and this sets a limit to what can be achieved.  The Gathering seems to be delivering a significant increase in visitors but it is too soon to give any detail.  Tourism Ireland figures show an increase in the region of 23% for the first quarter this year, but we must factor into that the fact that Easter fell in the first quarter.  It is too soon to speak with any precision.  The trend of visitors coming from Britain has been generally downward in recent years which is a big issue for Tourism Ireland to address.  The legacy of The Gathering is under active consideration.  Skills are being learned and developed as we go out and do something that has not been done before.  These need to be deployed continually, however that may be done.  I believe it will happen as we get closer to the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about the riches that exist at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013050800015#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368027600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The Farmleigh Fellowship is a good example of network members taking it upon themselves to go away from the forum and take forward ideas.  The people from Asia and, in particular, Singapore, who were at Farmleigh in 2009 went back to Singapore and identified a gap in expertise at a business level in Asia.  They established a one-year Asian graduate business studies programme between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and UCC.  Up to 25 graduates a year now carry out a period of study in UCC and complete their study in Singapore.  During that time, they are placed with companies in Asia, predominantly around Singapore.  In most cases, but not exclusively, they are Irish companies doing business out there.  It is working effectively and is a good example of network members bringing an idea through to completion with emigrant support programme funding.  We have given them funding over the past three years.<\/p><p>  The point about private equity is very well made.  One of the topics for priority discussion this year is financial services and supporting the SME sector, and something along the lines that Senator Walsh described would certainly be discussed.  After the last forum, there were various private sector initiatives to increase credit guarantees or access to credit for SMEs.  They have not come to fruition yet.

A few factors prompted its inclusion this year.  First, the third level education sector has become very outward focused and organised collectively in promoting itself overseas.  To some extent we were responding to that.  To some extent we were also responding to a message that was coming across loud and clear from members of the Global Irish Network that the future success of our economy would be dependent on the capabilities of our third level education sector and its ability to succeed internationally.  That is why it has been marked as a particular area for focus this year and perhaps should have been included more prominently in the previous network.  There are a number of circumstances that mark it as being timely now.<\/p><p>  On how we might identify the future generation, the Global Irish Network is one part of the overall networking work of embassies and consulates overseas.  It is a modest enough part in the scale of things.  For example, the consulate in New York has been working very closely with the Ireland-US Council, with the Ireland Funds, the American Ireland fund in particular, with the Irish business organisation, Irish International Business Network, and with a range of other smaller business networks as well.  The Global Irish Network is part of a much bigger picture.  The embassy in London is working with 20 business related networks.  Some of them are sectoral.

I thank members for the invitation to address them today on the Department of Defence&rsquo;s six monthly reports on developments in the EU during 2012, covering both the Danish and the Cypriot Presidencies.<\/p><p>  Since the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, conducts the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy, assisted by the European external action service, EEAS.  The role of the EEAS is to support the High Representative in fulfilling her mandate and to manage the EU's response to crises.  The role of the rotating Presidency is to provide additional support in fulfilling the mandates laid down while at the same time progressing its own priorities in consultation with other member states.<\/p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s<b><\/b>common security and defence policy, CSDP, forms an integral part of the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy, CFSP.  CSDP&rsquo;s primary function is to provide the Union with an operational capacity to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management missions outside the territory of the member states.  In addition to military tasks, there is a significant civilian and humanitarian dimension.  The EU is now a major player on the world stage with an increasing capacity to influence the international security agenda through a &ldquo;comprehensive approach&rdquo; using the instruments at its disposal, including economic, diplomatic, political and military instruments.  Further progress was made during 2012 in the areas of EU crisis management operations, EU civilian and military capabilities development, battle groups, partnerships with other organisations and the European Defence Agency.<\/p><p>  The most visible example of the impact of CSDP is EU peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  A key priority of the High Representative, of the EU and also of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union<b><\/b>is to ensure the continued success of these missions and preparing for new missions.  As an example, recently during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the EU Council agreed to the establishment of the EU training mission in Mali.  Sixteen missions and operations were undertaken during 2012, of which three were military operations and 13 were civilian missions.  These took place across three continents, with seven in Africa, four in the western Balkans, one in Asia, three in the Middle East and one in the south Caucasus.<\/p><p>  The three military operations in 2012 were Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Operation Atalanta, the anti-piracy mission off the coast of Somalia; and the EU training mission, EUTM, in Somalia, which is involved in training Somali security forces in Uganda.  Ireland is currently participating in two of these operations &ndash; Operation ALTHEA and EUTM Somalia &ndash; and we deployed to EUTM Mali in March 2013.  EU member states have continually praised the success of the EUTM Somalia mission and, in particular, the work carried out by the mission commander, Colonel Michael Beary.  Brigadier General Gerald Aherne, another Irish officer, has recently replaced Colonel Beary as the mission begins its third mandate and is charged with moving training from Uganda to Mogadishu.  This mission is now being used as a blueprint for other training missions, particularly in Mali, due to its outstanding success.<\/p><p>  As I have mentioned, EUTM Mali has been established during our Presidency.  This is intended to improve the military capacity of the Malian armed forces to allow, under civilian authority, the restoration of the country's territorial integrity.  It is an integral part of the EU's comprehensive approach to the situation in Mali and the Sahel.  It is providing military training as well as training and advice on specific areas such as command and control, human resources, international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.  It is not involved in combat operations and Ireland is contributing eight personnel as part of a joint training contingent with the UK armed forces.  Although Ireland and UK forces have worked together in different theatres and operations over many years, this is the first time a joint UK-Irish military contingent has been deployed on any such operation.  The provision of the joint UK-Ireland contingent underlines the very positive relationship that now exists between Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>  One of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities during our current Presidency of the Council of the European Union is the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP and the comprehensive approach to crisis management.  The Horn of Africa is an excellent example of the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach.  The fight against piracy in the region consists of three CSDP missions that are making a major contribution to support the efforts to bring peace, prosperity and stability to the Somali people.  These missions are complementary and form a coherent, integrated package that supports the EU's strategic framework for the Horn of Africa.  In the Sahel a similar approach has been taken, with the missions forming crucial elements of the EU strategy for security and development in the region.  This strategy focuses on Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Algeria and covers political, humanitarian and development dimensions with a strong security component.<\/p><p>  I will address the area of civilian and military capability developments.  The priority in this area is to provide the Union with an operational capacity, drawing on civilian and military assets, which can be used on missions outside the Union.  During 2012 and under the auspices of the European Defence Agency, EDA, work continued on the development of military capabilities, including identifying projects where member states can work together as part of the EDA&rsquo;s pooling and sharing initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368021600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Howard for his presentation.

It is important to know that.<\/p><p>  Some years ago we produced a Food for Thought paper promoting the idea of a much more integrated EU approach to supporting the UN in peacekeeping.  At the risk of using some slightly unparliamentary language, we kept pushing it and pushing it to get people to pay attention.  We have canvassed among EU member states an awareness of the fact that the EU has something it can contribute and an awareness of our understanding of the challenges the UN faces in trying to mount peacekeeping operations. We have had a thought and reflection process as to what the European Union and member states can bring to support the UN.  As I am sure members are aware, the UN has so much peacekeeping business on hands it is looking to outsource the provision of forces where it can to regional organisations, be it the European Union, NATO or the African Union.  There is a very serious issue, not a willingness issue but a capacity issue, in Africa among the countries that might contribute troops to peace support operations.  The technical sophistication of EU assets in addition to the financial resources of member states, even in a recession, are so deep that we can obviously bring something to the situation.<\/p><p>  In the course of the Irish Presidency, we did two things that are unique one of which was to hold a seminar.  We control to a degree the agenda by hosting seminars, as one brings people together and exposes people who would not normally meet each other to an exchange of views in the hope that one will create a momentum for change and a better understanding.  Our seminar in February brought together the African Union, the UN, NATO and the European Union.  These people do not normally meet.  It was a very good seminar.  In particular, the representative of the African Union was able to give a very forthright and direct account of the deficiencies and the problems they face.<\/p><p>  By way of background, I could mention that the European Union mounted an operation in Chad, which we had the opportunity to visit as part of our troops.  Chad is two and a half times the size of France and has 300 km of paved road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050800003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368022200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I have another question on the same matter.

I seek reassurance in the context of an improvement in EU-UN relations that other agencies are not beginning to challenge the UN on the basis that it has in some way failed to fulfil its responsibilities.

The UN is no more and no less than the member states.  If the member states agree to do something, it gets done.  One of the factors that constrains the UN in operation is the Security Council because permanent members have a veto.  That is outside of our control but that is the situation.<\/p><p>  The second big constraint on the UN is resources.  If the United Nations mounts a blue hat operation, the financial cost of it falls on the UN, and its capacity to fund and resource the operations is limited.  Therefore, it asks organisations such as the EU and NATO to come in, but always under a UN mandate so the political legitimacy of the missions derives from the United Nations.  The difference is that regional organisations such as the EU or NATO pay for the operation and relieve the UN of the financial burden, plus they might bring a depth of capacity and technical ability that the UN would not perhaps get voluntarily.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to bring clarity to the position with NATO.  Basically, the relationship we have with NATO is stable.  It has not changed.  We are a member of NATO&rsquo;s Partnership for Peace.  Since the late 1990s, when the change in peacekeeping took place, and since the UN asked organisations such as NATO to go peacekeeping, we have participated in NATO-led peacekeeping operations, as do all of the other neutral countries.  It is a general policy on peacekeeping that even when an organisation such as NATO or the European Union mounts an operation, it is open to third countries if they wish to join in because it is basically a UN operation.  However, if one is operating at such a high technical level, one cannot simply show up in the mission area and hope one will be able to operate with other high-tech forces in a seamless way.  For that reason, NATO has developed a plethora of standards and when one goes with NATO &ndash; to use what might be a frivolous illustration, one cannot show up with two-pin plugs if everyone else has three-pin sockets.  There are NATO standards for every type of equipment, for communications and procedures of every kind so that one can operate seamlessly together.  The way in which countries such as Ireland that are not members of NATO get access to the standards is through Partnership for Peace.  That is its purpose.  We have a partnership programme and its focus is to ensure we are interoperable with NATO on peacekeeping missions.  That is its purpose and goal.<\/p><p>  NATO welcomes the participation of this country because we have such a strong reputation in peacekeeping.  Our presence on missions underlines the fact that it is basically a UN peacekeeping operation being performed by NATO and not a NATO mission.  Our dialogue with NATO takes place on the basis that we are a partner but not a member.  We have no agenda to change the nature of our participation with it.  I acknowledge that we have got tremendous technical support and assistance from NATO in achieving full interoperability for peacekeeping missions.  I am anxious to correct any belief people have that our relationship with NATO is one that is in some sort of fundamental transit.  Both sides fully understand and respect the fact that we are not a member and we are not an applicant but we co-operate with peacekeeping, and in between missions, we do the training and follow the standards that are necessary to go on peace support operations when they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050800004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1368022200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I have one more question and I will be brief as I do not wish to hog the meeting.

That has been the collective view of European Union members.  When the discussions take place, some feel more of an abundance of caution than others.  Perhaps Lord Ashdown sits on that side of the fence.  It is perhaps a policy question that goes a little bit beyond my role.  This country did participate, when it was a much larger mission, with a number of other countries on the downsizing.  We were anxious to see the mission as part of a normalisation process transit into more of a support operation for Bosnia Herzegovina rather than a large mission on the ground.<\/p><p>  On Somalia, the headquarters of the mission will move to Mogadishu.  An indication has been given by the Ugandan authorities that they would like to see an end to training in Uganda and to have it moved back to Somalia.  The Somali authorities would also like that to happen.  What we are told is that the decision on training is one that will be made based on conditions on the ground.  There has been talk of doing it in the relatively near future but we have been told that the decision to move is conditions-based, not timeline-based.  A decision is expected.

The latter implies that there is a \"peace in place\" and the aim of a peacekeeping operation is to maintain that peace.  There can be a mandate for a more robust action, where the conditions of a \"peace in place\" do not exist and that can become a peace enforcement operation.  There is also the much broader concept of security sector reform.  The Chad mission, for example, had a peace enforcement mandate, which is one end of the spectrum.  On the other hand, the training mission in Uganda, involving the training of Somali troops, is a peace support operation.  That operation is about capacity building.  We are simply training people outside of the site of the operation.  The full range of operations can be encompassed by the term \"peace support\" operations.<\/p><p> I am not sure what I said exactly what I said about NATO because I was not reading from a prepared script but I believe I said that our relationship with NATO is stable and is not changing.  We are not going to become a member of NATO.  That is not on NATO's agenda or on ours.  On the issue of NATO and the UN, it is important to remember that they have a good relationship and do not see themselves as competitors.  The UN is asking NATO to do more in terms of fielding peace support operations generally.  <\/p><p>  I would like to comprehensively reassure the Deputy that while we have a very good and very friendly relationship with  NATO, Ireland, along with other EU member states, would be a very strong advocate for ensuring that at all times the European Union and NATO have completely separate decision making structures.  We would be very careful to monitor that.  We also are extremely careful to monitor what are sovereign decisions for Ireland.  How much money we spend on defence, what we spend it on and when and where we deploy our troops are exclusively sovereign decisions for Ireland at all times.  At times, perhaps inadvertently, other countries may raise issues that we feel could be seen to cross those boundaries and we will always make our position very clear in those circumstances.  I believe that our position is understood by NATO and the European Union.  Indeed, within the European Union, our position is respected.

Representatives of the UN would be very open about the fact that it is overstretched because of the number of peacekeepers it has to field in places like Africa.  Therefore, the NATO\/UN relationship is very much based on the UN asking NATO to field peace support operations.   I do not have any brief to speak on behalf of NATO or to make any case for its continued existence but it is a fact that it exists and has become a significant player in supplying assets for peace support operations.

I will move on to the next question.  As Mr. Howard is aware, the operation in Mali has a wider context.  Many of the European countries have a colonial history, particularly in north Africa but also throughout Africa - we are talking about north Africa for the purposes of this conversation - which is not something to be proud of.  There are always concerns about the natural resources and the interests of corporations based in Europe.  The most recent conflicts include the uprising in Tunisia where France was seen to have been on the wrong side and continued to support Ben Ali, the dictator, up to the end.  In Libya, the African Union strongly criticised the NATO response to the UN Security Council Resolution which was not about regime change but protection of civilians.  Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and I had the opportunity to meet the chairman of the African Union, Jean Ping, who actually put those detailed criticisms to us regarding its concerns about what would happen.  Those concerns have been vindicated.  This has been the recent context for NATO-led operations in Africa, in Libya against the advice and interests of the African Union itself and in Mali where we have deployed eight members of our Defence Forces - we have had a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Defence Forces because the number has to reach 12.<\/p><p>  We know there is considerable criticism of the Malian government and army in terms of human rights abuses from the UN and Human Rights Watch and other human rights NGOs.  The question for people who are proud of our neutrality and the potential that neutrality offers in conflict resolution across the world is what are we doing there with a NATO-led operation, under a UN banner, which I accept.  It is a NATO state-led operation, and NATO is involved in training an army that is guilty of gross human rights abuses and taking sides. Meanwhile, on the other side we are very proud of our Defence Forces in Lebanon who are in blue helmet operations that are peacekeeping operations.  That has been our legacy.<\/p><p>  Today we were at church honouring our 1916 heroes and on our right hand side there were those who gave their life for the State, proudly serving our Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations.  There are UN Security Council resolutions about Palestine, the settlements in Palestine and the illegal settlements that are ongoing to this day.  Ireland has never militarily given support to the Palestinian people or intervened to enforce those UN Security Council resolutions, yet we have chosen to go under a banner and operate in Mali.

I cannot speculate on the motives of other participants in peace support operations.  I understand the Deputy's point of view but perhaps it is somewhat outside of the remit of the Department of Defence in Ireland.  The EU training mission in Somalia is a training mission.  When we were on the evaluation process in relation to the mission in Somalia, a lot of questions were asked about the people we were going to train, what might happen with the training and there were risks involved.  The only way to have no risks is to have no mission.  I am not saying this to be tendentious but to understand from our point of view if we wait until conditions are perfect we will never go into a mission.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has rightly brought to attention the fact that some people may question the motives of some of the people involved.  Whether that is right or wrong I cannot say but what I can say is that there is no question over the motives of countries such as Ireland.  It is better that we participate.  When we participate we get our flag over the mission headquarters and we get a say in what is done.  Whatever other people may think, if Irish troops go on an EU training mission it will train Malian forces to the best way that they can be trained and we have no hidden agenda.<\/p><p>  Questions have been raised about the conduct of the forces in the past.  While it would not be appropriate for me to get into a debate about that, I acknowledge the fact that questions have been raised.  The question for us then is what should we do about it.  I would like to think that if a training team with an Irish component gets involved it is far more likely to improve the situation than disimprove it but I have to acknowledge the fact that it is not a perfect situation.  What I am saying to the Deputy is that if we wait until it is perfect then they will not need the training.<\/p><p>  There is a humanitarian law component in the training that our trainers will give.  Irish soldiers, because it is part of their own training as they all have peace support and peacekeeping experience, will be very good mentors and role models for the troops involved in training.  They are also having an input with the other trainers.  Our relationship with our British colleagues in regard to this training mission is very good.  Our personnel, when they went to Britain for the joint training before deployment, found that the UK side was waiting to be given guidance as to what to do, waiting to learn from our experience in Somalia.  It is very much the right thing to do to participate, accepting that it will not bring about a perfect world, but I think we definitely have an impact.<\/p><p>  In the other areas where we are trying to have an influence, perhaps trying to have a political influence over the policy of the European Union regarding the UN, the fact that we participate in missions gives us a voice that will be heard.  People listen if one shows up at the airport when the mission starts.  That is another reason we should be positively disposed to participate in missions, accepting the fact that the missions may not be perfect.  Whenever one goes into a multinational peace support operation, some of the other countries participating may or may not be the people we would choose.  Let us remember we might not be the people they would choose.  As long as everybody goes on the mission and fulfils the mandate we are improving the situation.  I believe the presence of countries such as Ireland and other like-minded neutral countries is positive in that context, which is why we are supporters of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013050800006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1368023400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Are there any other comments or questions?

I was one of those who was faced with a choice in the context of dual careers.  The question which arose was whether I should go to work or whether I should run.  I chose to run, for economic reasons.  The Institute of Sport has done fantastic work in terms of preparing our sports people and educating them in respect of their careers after sport.  The Minister of State referred to dual careers and the guidelines that have been prepared and said that a number of conclusions, which will be presented next week, have been reached.  What form do the guidelines, which were not mentioned in the Minister of State's presentation, take?<\/p><p>  We are aware that doping in sport is a scourge.  There are examples of doping taking place at many Olympiads.  For example, the 1,500 m champion at the Beijing Olympics was found to have doped and was stripped of his gold medal.  The women's 1,500 m champion from the London Olympics was recently found guilty of doping.  Only last week the winner of the women's 60 m hurdles at the European indoor championships was proven to be guilty of doping.  I hope Derval O'Rourke, who finished fourth in that event, will be promoted to the bronze medal position.  We refer to the fundamental principles of honesty and fair play in sport and we try to instil these into the young people we coach and try to encourage to participate in sport.  In the context of the Government's relationships with the various sports councils throughout the world, is it time to replace the current three-strikes-and-you-are-out system with a one-strike model?  Should sports people sign up to a code of conduct which stipulates that if they take drugs and are caught, they are out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800005#E00400","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1368003000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Senator Brennan is correct.  Last year was the first time since 2008 that there has been a sports capital programme.  We received a record 2,170 applications.  We grant-aided 648 separate facilities throughout the country.  I would have liked to have had more money to distribute.  The breakdown in respect of the programme is that &euro;26 million was invested in local schemes and &euro;5 million in regional or major schemes.  We took this approach to try to get the money to the grass roots.  That is why we limited the funding for regional and major schemes to &euro;5 million.  If we had left matters open, major schemes would have sought &euro;7 million, &euro;8 million or &euro;12 million in respect of various projects.  We just could not allow that to happen.  I would love to put another scheme in place and I am currently negotiating with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, in that regard.  I would like to obtain the support of the committee in respect of this matter.  Perhaps the Chairman might issue correspondence to the Ministers involved informing them of the economic value of the sports capital programme.  For every &euro;1 spent on sport, the return is &euro;1.26.  Therefore, this money creates employment and encourages participation in sport.  A stimulus budget is again due to be introduced this year and I hope it will contain funding for a further sports capital programme.<\/p><p>  As already stated, we received 2,170 applications last year, the largest number received since the scheme was originally established, simply because there had not been a programme in place since 2008.  I thank my officials for the way in which they dealt with those applications.  Members will understand that the number of applications received relates to the economic problems we are experiencing.  Many sports clubs require funding in respect of their facilities and I am delighted that matters worked out so well.

We are also hoping to encourage them to enter dialogue with their educational institutions.  The Senator was one of our top athletes for many years.  He is quite correct in that he was obliged to strike a balance between his running and his education, particularly as he was not going to remain an elite athlete forever.  The time for him to retire from athletics was always going to arrive and he needed to have another career.  We are asking member states to enter discussions with their universities and encourage them to put in place courses which would provide athletes with an opportunity to train and compete and, simultaneously, allow them to pursue educational goals.  What we are seeking is flexibility.  We are hoping this will be forthcoming, particularly in the context of the universities.  We will also be asking the sporting organisations to support athletes and assist them in obtaining an education.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the position of the young people who leave these shores each year to pursue careers in professional soccer in Britain.  How many of them actually make it?  They leave believing they will be the next Roy Keane and many of them return disillusioned.  It used to be the case that they would leave at 16, 17 or 18 years of age.  They would spend a few years at a club and if they did not make it, they would return.  Many of them were not educated and found it difficult to get into the workplace.  We are asking educational institutions to make these types of courses available to athletes and other sports people to assist them in pursuing their goals.  There is life after sport and it is not everyone who makes it.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan did not do too badly during his sporting career and fair play to him.  I am joking, of course, when I say that.  However, I reiterate that not everyone makes it and there is a problem in the context of those who have no place to go when their sporting careers end.  Those who make it do fine, but those who do not encounter problems.<\/p><p>  The Senator also referred to drugs in sport.  I have been very strong on this matter in Europe.  I reiterate my belief that anyone, regardless of his or her sport, who uses performance-enhancing drugs is a cheat.  We are trying to get governments involved at European level.  I understand that the organisers of some of the major marathons insist on athletes signing a document whereby if they are caught doping at a later stage, they will be obliged to return whatever prize money they may make in those marathons.  Lance Armstrong admitted that he had cheated, but he acquired vast sums of money which he still retains.  That is wrong because it means that cheaters are being supported.  Some of these individuals, through cheating, have enough money to maintain their lifestyles for the remainder of their years.  Stronger sanctions must be introduced.<\/p><p>  As the Senator is aware, each country in Europe deals with its own sporting organisations.  We must work together, however, because those involved in doping are adopting ever more sophisticated methods, their drug use is not capable of being detected.  We must do more than test for drugs.  The new passport whereby athletes can be monitored for many years must be introduced across Europe.  Some parts of Europe are extremely well regulated but that is not the position in other countries where there is no regulation at all.  As a former international runner, Senator Eamonn Coghlan knows he was competing against individuals who were not subject to the same rigorous testing as him.  That is a matter which must be dealt with at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800005#E00700","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1368003000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Is it possible that we might adopt a one-strike-and-you-are-out approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800005#E00800","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1368003000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>As stated, the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, is meeting in Montreal this week.

Like Senator Brennan and others I welcome the way the sports capital programme operates, whereby modest amounts are given to a greater number of clubs and organisations throughout the country.  This has been of great benefit.  Often such clubs only need modest support and it is a great lift for them.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to dual careers in sports.  This is a significant issue.  In many ways sports define countries.  When we think of Brazil, we think of soccer; when we think of long distance running, we think of other countries in Africa; and with middle distance running we think of north Africa.  The idea of world-class sports people and athletes having to train or participate at the weekend but having to go to work on Monday essentially will not work.  We need to get from a position where there is a good prospect or young athlete or sports person to a position where he is beginning to define himself in that sport.  One must have some way of incentivising or dealing with employers.  I know of one person in the past 12 months in west Cork who has had success as a long distance swimmer, Steve Redmond.  He works a day job.  Only for the generosity of his employer he simply would not have been able to achieve a fraction of what he has achieved.  How do we unlock the potential of these people but not hammer the employers who look after them in their day jobs?  I presume this is one of the difficulties and if the Minister of State had a steer on the issue I would be glad to hear it.<\/p><p>  My second point relates to doping.  I fully agree with the sentiments of Senator Coghlan and the Minister of State.  He is passionate against doping.  In the past 12 months I have heard from various commentators in the media.  There seems to be a move to allow a dirty game or sport whereby everyone is free to take whatever they like and the fastest, strongest or best will win, whereby everyone is allowed to dope.  I listened to some of these comments with horror.  Many of the comments came from commentators who should know better.  I presume the Minister of State has a view on the matter.  I hear these comments more and more and the matter should be nailed on the head.  It would not solve a problem but it would be a start.  I do not understand that warped mentality.  I am unsure what can be achieved but I would appreciate the comments of the Minister of State in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800006#F00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1368003600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>There are three questions there.

That is why we have the Irish Sports Council.  We provide funding for them.  The Irish Sports Council targets and funds elite athletes.  Sometimes people forget that we fund them well.  There is a mechanism in place and the council is changing that mechanism.  We are also giving funding to the national governing bodies and they make decisions.  Deputy Harrington referred to a promising swimmer.  The council can provide the financial back-up and support that such athletes need to enhance their position and ensure they get the opportunities they deserve.  The Irish Sports Council has worked well.<\/p><p>  People talk about the Olympic and Paralympic Games that took place recently.  The reason those involved in the Paralympic Game did so well was because they had the funding from the Irish Sports Council, especially in the case of the elite athletes, and they acknowledge as much.  They were well-prepared, well-trained and they were given the necessary back-up and support from the Irish Sports Council.  It worked well.  That is why we had such success in the Olympic Games with boxing.  It is some years ago since funding for boxing was put in place.  These boxers were supported financially and were given the professional team lead by Mr. Walsh.  People come from throughout the world to examine how we have done so well in boxing and that speaks for itself.  The Irish Sports Council provides the funding for elite athletes.  It helps and supports them and gives them the opportunity, especially in the case of athletes at their peak who are getting good funding from the council.<\/p><p>  This year the council has given some funding to the national governing bodies.  This means the governing bodies must make decisions as well.  One cannot have someone in receipt of this funding who is making no progress.  At times the bodies must make decisions and decide on the people who are going well, going places and who should be supported.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington referred to dual careers.  Employers in this country have been very good.  Deputy O'Mahony has managed football teams and is aware of this.  Employers have been very helpful and supportive of sport and rightly so.  However, there is only so far their generosity can go, especially in these economic times.  That is why we have the position on dual careers and flexibility.  We are trying to ensure flexibility between the employers and education institutes to try to give athletes the opportunity to develop themselves and make a career out of sports.  That is what we are at.  When we go before the meeting next week in Brussels we will bring in the conclusions.  Representatives will go back to their counties and the conclusions will be finalised at a later stage to establish whether we can bring in support mechanisms to try to deal with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800006#F00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1368003600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister of State on his positive report today.

It was a great let-down for the athlete concerned that she did not get up on the winners podium.

My priority is to target it at grassroots level.  As we did the last time, shared facilities will be prioritised.  The day when we could have facilities in universities, colleges or schools which were not open to the general public are gone.  If taxpayers' money is being provided for such facilities, we should open them up to make sure they are shared.  GAA or soccer clubs should make their facilities available for schools.  If colleges and universities are not closed at weekends and for three months during the summer, their facilities should be made freely available if they are in receipt of taxpayers' money.  <\/p><p>  If we receive another round of sports capital funding I will re-examine grassroots organisations.  What was said was quite correct, namely, that small amounts of money are required and small facilities need basic things like dressing rooms and playing facilities of a fairly good standard.

How are we progressing in trying to combat those aspects of cheating?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800007#G00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I agree with many of his targets on increasing participation among the general public.  I have heard him speak of it many times and it is commendable.  Sports capital funding allows this to happen.  I agree with sharing facilities; it is important they are used to their maximum capacity and that advantage is given to applications for sports capital funding for communities and clubs that do that.<\/p><p>  I have some questions on the information provided on the meeting next week, and doping and corruption in sport.  What can be done at European or national level to stop corruption?  It was demonstrated in the Lance Armstrong case, for example, that there was a combination of doping and corruption.  The Armstrong foundation provided funding to the cycling federations which were policing Lance Armstrong, and as a result the policing failed.  <\/p><p>  Things are similar in Ireland.  Is the Minister of State happy with the various governing bodies of sport in Ireland?  The success of the boxers in the recent Olympic Games has been articulated well.  What is the Minister of State's view on money being targeted at sports with competitors who have better chance of winning at Olympic level?  <\/p><p>  In some of the governing bodies, such as Swim Ireland, 50% of the funding released by the Sports Council goes into administration.  I understand there are fewer than 25 high performance swimmers, three centres and 100 staff throughout the country.  Maybe all the funding is used wisely.  <\/p><p>  The director of Irish swimming lives and works in Florida and is, I presume, in receipt of a substantial salary.  Swimming in Ireland seems to be governed by remote control.  I could articulate a number of examples.  I would like to say I raise the issue for the benefit of swimming in Ireland, not to criticise it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800007#G00400","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  Deputy Tom Fleming raised the possibility of Ireland hosting a future rugby world cup.  We are engaged in negotiations with the Irish Rugby Football Union on this issue and they are going well.  I am very hopeful that we will be able to host a world cup in due course.  A great deal of research is being done in this regard, including a feasibility study, and we have had several meetings to discuss the potential that is there.  This country is well capable of hosting international events, as we have proved in the past.  I would be delighted to see Ireland hosting the tournament in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about the prospects for an increase in capital funding.  We all want to see that happening and I am hopeful it will be achieved.  The Deputy referred to some of the difficulties encountered by retired athletes.  We are seeking to alleviate those difficulties through efforts to encourage dual careers, retraining and further education.  In particular, we are in discussions with the third level institutions with a view to assisting retired athletes in finding a new career after sports.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that doping and match fixing are a major problem for all sports.  I recently participated, with the Commissioner, in a panel discussion in Brussels, where we heard very strong representations, including one from Interpol, on the issue of match fixing.  Interpol appealed to Governments throughout the European Union to co-operate and support each other in seeking to tackle this form of corruption.  There is a data protection issue there which cannot be ignored, but there is no denying the requirement for action.  If should be possible for the authorities in one jurisdiction to convey information they have received to the authorities in other jurisdictions.  There is a major debate taking place in Europe on this issue and an international convention recently discussed it.  If we do not take action against doping, match fixing and other types of corruption, they will destroy the entire edifice of sport.  It is in everybody's interest that we seek to address them.<\/p><p>  Deputy John O'Mahony spoke about what can be done at international level in regard to doping.  It is all about co-operation and sharing information.  Testing is only one tool in our potential arsenal.  There is also a role for Governments and customs authorities, for example, in monitoring the types of drugs that are coming into their jurisdictions.  Many of the substances we are talking about are being purchased over the Internet.  That must stop and it will require everybody working together, across different jurisdictions, to eradicate the scourge.  As I said, there is a question mark over efforts in this regard in the context of data protection considerations, but that difficulty is under discussion.  We are fortunate in this country to have a person of Dr. Una May's calibre in our midst.  The Chairman might consider inviting her to a meeting so that members can avail of her expertise.  She is in demand throughout Europe as one of the foremost experts in these matters.  She could explain, for instance, how the testing is done and what is required.  Members should be assured that a substantial investment is being made by the Government in this area.<\/p><p>  In regard to Swim Ireland, the Irish Sports Council does monitor and audit that body.  I do not have the specific information the Deputy requested to hand, but I will ask the chief executive officer of the council, Mr. John Treacy, to respond in writing to the Deputy.  It is the council's responsibility to monitor the bodies under its aegis and ensure the funding it dispenses is spent wisely.  Every sporting organisation must set aside a certain amount of funding for administrative functions, but I agree that the figures the Deputy gave to do not seem to add up.  I will ask Mr. Treacy to respond directly to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It is an issue I raised out of concern rather than from any other agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>As it happens, Mr. Treacy has been invited to attend a meeting of the committee on 29 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I will avail of that opportunity to raise these matters with Mr. Treacy, but I would be grateful if the Minister of State would contact him as he suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00500","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>Of course.

There are ongoing and regular discussions between the council and the various sports governing bodies and procedures in this regard are kept up to date.

The hosting of the American football team Notre Dame in Croke Park last year attracted large numbers of visitors.  Is the Government lobbying other international sports organisations to encourage more of that type of engagement?  I met some of the visitors who came to Dublin for the Notre Dame game, many of whom travelled to other parts of the country to meet relatives.  They were greatly enthused by the reception they received here, it being their first trip to Ireland in many cases.  Is any work going on in the background in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00700","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Yes, we are working on that issue.  The Chairman is correct that last year's Notre Dame game brought thousands of visitors not only to Dublin, but to locations throughout the country.  It was the first time I ever saw taxi drivers, hoteliers, restaurateurs and publicans so united in their efforts to put on a good show.  The message those visitors brought back to the United States was a very strong and positive one, namely, that there is value to be had from holidaying in Ireland and people here are friendly and welcoming.  The event itself was a tremendous success, as was the Volvo ocean race.  We are always working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to target those types of major international events.  There is a significant cost factor with some of them which would often require a feasibility study.  Many local authorities are involved in encouraging college teams to come over to Ireland from the United States.  I launched South Dublin County Council's initiative in this regard as part of The Gathering.  American football is somewhat different from soccer, Gaelic football and hurling or rugby in that its games are an occasion for extended families, with grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and children all attending together.  We saw that in the numbers who came to Dublin for the Notre Dame game and we are targeting more events like it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland would agree that in terms of return to the economy, it was the best value event for the money we spent on it. Above all, however, it allowed us to send a strong message abroad that this country is alive and well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800008#H00800","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1368004800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am aware that I am moving away from sport but will the Minister of State give us a summary of the figures in regard to The Gathering?

I will supply the figures.  I am glad that the Chairman asked the question, as it gives me an opportunity to discuss the matter.  The Gathering is going brilliantly.  Our first quarter figures increased by more than 7.2%.  Our North American, Italian, French, German and other markets are doing well, but the British market has been weak in recent years.  The good news is that, for the first time in many years, there has been an increase in our British figures.  It is not that the British traveller had been going elsewhere.  With Britain's economy, people were simply not travelling at all.<\/p><p>  The Gathering is not working because of my Department, F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland, but because 15,000 to 16,000 Irish people attended public meetings in September, October, November and December and did something that I have not seen done for a long time, that being, they mobilised.  As the Chairman and every elected representative knows, events are being held every weekend in every corner of this country.  When my old school in Westport held its reunion last weekend, people came from England, America and across Europe.  That experience is being replicated across the country.  We were expecting the first quarter to be weak.  The New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day celebrations had a good effect and April to July looks to be a promising period.  I am confident that The Gathering will work because it is community led.<\/p><p>  I compliment the country's communities and volunteers who are doing something instead of just talking.  I thank the local authorities and public bodies for their funding.  I also want to thank everyone who has played a part.  I am confident that The Gathering will be a major success.  We need to build a legacy out of it.  People who visit our country this year will be our ambassadors for the coming years.  They will take with them a good or a bad message about Ireland.  I want it to be a good one, as tourism is important to us.  We expect 325,000 extra visitors this year, providing revenue that is badly wanted.  For every 35 visitors, a job is created.  It is important that we make The Gathering a success.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked about VAT.  When we entered into government, we targeted tourism as a priority for job creation.  The Government reduced the VAT rate from 13% to 9%.  It also changed PRSI rates for low-paid workers.  We changed the visa rules so that people who had visas to visit Britain could continue into Ireland.  This was a major problem, as a person from outside Europe could have waited as long as three months for an Irish visa.  The new system is working well.<\/p><p>  The VAT rate will continue this year.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, who knows my opinions on this issue.  The current rate should be retained, although this is a matter for the Government.  In 99.9% of cases, the reduction was passed on.  For the first time, the general public saw a reduction in the cost of eating in restaurants.  It helped the tourism trade.  The recent budget introduced tax initiatives to help hoteliers to redevelop their properties.  Their main problem relates to their borrowings.  I recently attended a dinner in Limerick of 470 hoteliers.  They were upbeat and believed they had turned a corner.  This is an important year for them and I hope that we can support them.  I also hope that the Government will see fit to leave VAT at its current rate for another two years at least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800009#J00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1368005400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800009#J00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1368005400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister of State on his passion and enthusiasm for and commitment to tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800009#J00400","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1368005400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Would the Senator not leave that to me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013050800009#J00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1368005400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Excuse me.
