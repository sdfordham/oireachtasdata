This is a strategic and fully co-ordinated approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.<\/p><p>  The Programme which is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk, lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning of the flood risk management measures throughout the country, including capital structural and non-structural measures.<\/p><p>  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies through which, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design. These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan.<\/p><p>  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis using Multi-Criteria Analysis. More information on the Programme is available on   .<\/p><p>  Flood risk from coastal erosion is also integrated into and being assessed under the CFRAM Programme. 90 of the 300 areas of significant flood risk are in coastal areas.  Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process and has beneficial as well as detrimental effects.  It is a complex issue and requires to be addressed in a holistic manner to ensure that the best possible approach is adopted in each particular instance. Structural intervention is not always the best option and in some cases it can be difficult to justify such intervention on economic and\/or environmental grounds. <\/p><p>  There is a strategy in place to deal with coastal erosion.  The primary objective of policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where intervention measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, these are implemented subject to the availability of resources.<\/p><p>  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information will be available shortly to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature as appropriate.<\/p><p>  In some cases a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;no activation&rdquo; intervention approach might be the most appropriate management response, and international studies have borne this out.<\/p><p>  In the context of the damage done in the recent storms, I have made it clear that it is never going to be possible to protect all of the vulnerable areas of Irish coastline. This is why it is essential that a comprehensive risk based approach to coastal protection is followed.  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10<sup>th<\/sup> January of this year to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under this Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre storm condition.  The specific application form for this entitled <i>Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014<\/i>   is available on OPW's website www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.<\/p><p>  The Government decided on 11 February to make funding of up to &euro;70 million available to assist local authorities with the repair and remediation of damaged public infrastructure. Of this total, an amount of up to &euro;20 million may be made available to assist with the cost of repairing damaged coastal protection infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600065#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600065#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[9302\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600065#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to implement the recommendations in the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht report on Shannon flooding published in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders toward agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring\/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding, particularly in the Shannon Callows area.  This trial commenced in Summer 2013 and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM Plan.<\/p><p>  On foot of discussions between my colleague, Minister of State Tom Hayes and the IFA and with the cooperation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, a water level monitoring exercise is being carried out as part of the CFRAM process which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.

This will include greater use of alternative models of service delivery, such as commissioning for specific outcomes, and service delivery improvements at sectoral and organisational levels.<\/p><p>  As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.\u00a0 As efficiencies are realised through initiatives such as public procurement reform and shared services, some of the savings made will be re-invested in improved services.\u00a0 This Reform Dividend  will serve to underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.<\/p><p>  The Public Service must make maximum use of new technologies, digitalisation and open data to deliver services in innovative ways.\u00a0 A new Government ICT Strategy will be published later this year that will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that eGovernment is designed around real needs and taking steps to improve the take-up of 'digital government'.\u00a0 As part of this new strategy, we are capturing data on the top transactional services on which the citizen engages with the State, which will help inform what further services will be put online.<\/p><p>  \u00a0The new plan also places a focus on increased openness, transparency and accountability.  Citizens must be able to clearly see that the Public Service is working fairly in its decision making, in implementing policy and in delivering public services.  In this context, the political reform programme will deliver greater openness, transparency and accountability to strengthen trust in government and public services and strengthen public governance.  A particularly important development is the recent publication of a consultation paper focused on options for strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.<\/p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement will be a key enabler of the reform programme and will deliver an additional &euro;1 billion reduction in the cost of the Public Service pay and pensions bill by 2016.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In delivering reform, we will continue to ensure that\u00a0we have\u00a0strong implementation and governance structures, which were an important element of the first Reform Plan.  The Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform will continue to provide strategic direction and hold senior managers to account for the delivery of reform.  Each Department and Office has also developed their own Integrated Reform Delivery Plan, based on the commitments set out in the overall Reform Plan and also incorporating their own organisational and sectoral reform objectives.<\/p><p>  The full details of our ambitious reform programme are set out on the new Reform Plan.  This includes over 200 specific actions with clear timelines for each.  As you will be aware, I also published a Progress Report on 14 January, which sets out the considerable progress made to date on Public Service Reform.  Both documents are available at www.reformplan.per.gov.ie.

I have set out in the tables below details of payments to providers of external advisory services and the annual totals from 2011 to the end of 2013 in respect of Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade) and of Vote 27 (International Cooperation).<\/p><p>  These services are procured by competitive tender in accordance with EU and national rules and I am satisfied that this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of my Department&rsquo;s remit, particularly in relation to the external services engaged for the independent monitoring and evaluation of  Ireland&rsquo;s programme of overseas development assistance, Irish Aid.   Given the overall scale, range and diversity of the Irish Aid programme, as well as the firm commitment to the highest quality, accountability and evaluation, it is necessary to complement the in-house capacity with specialised skills and advice. The level of expenditure on consultancy services is constantly monitored to ensure that it does not exceed the level required for the proper management, oversight, monitoring, evaluation and audit of the aid programme.<\/p><p>  With regard to legal services, my Department generally seeks advice on domestic legal matters from the Office of the Attorney General and\/or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. Depending on the subject-matter, domestic litigation is dealt with on my Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office or the State Claims Agency which engage lawyers to act for the Department where necessary and pay their fees. My Department has a Legal Division, which deals with matters of public international law, human rights law, and European Union law and other relevant legal issues. The Division also acts as agent for the Government before certain international courts and tribunals, such as the European Court of Human Rights. In this regard, it works closely with the Office of the Attorney General, which pays the fees of external lawyers.  The Department&rsquo;s Missions abroad engage local legal advisers from time to time to deal with a range of miscellaneous matters.

The relief is restricted to investments which are used by the company for the purposes of carrying on relevant trading activities.

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  A change in VAT rates must be in compliance with the EU VAT Directive.  The European Court of Justice (CJEU), which is the final arbiter on VAT matters, has ruled in a number of cases, most recently in the Bridport &amp;amp; West Dorset Golf Club Limited case (C-495\/12), that the application of VAT must be uniform across all categories of recipients of services.

The preferred approach is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.<\/p><p>  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.  There is no specific circular governing the use of ABA.<\/p><p>  My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from NEPS; the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism and takes full account of advice from a range of international experts on autism, including persons with expertise and qualifications in ABA.  The various contributors who have informed this policy are too numerous to mention but the Deputy may wish to note that the Task Force for Autism Report is available on my Department's website and includes a detailed bibliography.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have asked the NCSE to provide policy advice specifically on the educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders.

The advice will also draw upon new research commissioned by the NCSE for this purpose as well as any other research which may be available and which the NCSE considers merits consideration. It will be open to all interested parties to contribute to the consultation process for the policy advice and I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600071#WRGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Qualifications","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600071#WRGG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[9743\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600071#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide details of the training available to teachers through the Special Education Support Service in teaching children with autism including ABA, TEACCH, and PECS; the length of these courses; the number of teachers who have applied for and the number who have participated in them during each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[9744\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600071#WRGG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of postgraduate programme places for teachers involved in learning support and special education; and the number of teachers who have availed of these places during each of the past three years.

Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in September 2003. The brief of the SESS is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes.<\/p><p>  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs. This approach is supported by ongoing monitoring of educational objectives to determine whether a child is benefiting from a particular intervention or range of interventions and to allow for appropriate adjustment to objectives and strategies. Reflective of the important role of CPD, my Department, through SESS, has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).<\/p><p>  Provision by SESS for CPD in relation to Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), within the learning and teaching context is as follows: <\/p><p>(a) Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (C-ABA) Course - this course provides an introduction to ABA for practising teachers in special education settings in Irish schools.

This course does not purport to prepare teachers for any level of ABA-specific qualification. In terms of academic discipline this course presents behavioural concepts and principles through the educational lens. It is a course for teachers who are enabled to combine their educational qualifications and experiences, of which psychology is a central element, with concepts and principles of ABA for application in the learning and teaching of pupils with special educational needs including pupils with ASDs. It addresses the management of behaviour that interferes with children's learning and the provision of curricular experiences that are concerned with the holistic development of each child.

The Five Year Construction Plan that I announced in March 2012 is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan.  My Department's assessment of any application for large scale capital funding will therefore take into account planned provision under the Five Year Plan and clear evidence of substantial pressure for pupils places in all schools serving the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600073#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600073#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[10011\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600073#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will indicate, in tabular form, the total expenditure by his Department on external consultancy advice services, including legal services, in 2011 to 2013, inclusive; if this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Establishing suitability criteria that are appropriate to a particular contract is a matter for the contracting authority concerned since they are in the best position to understand the delivery requirements for that specific contract. Once appropriate suitability criteria are established it is important to apply proportionate minimum standards to these criteria.\u00a0In this regard my Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects, published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3 Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers.\u00a0).\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.

","asker":"1103","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>Under EU Directives on public procurement works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on the basis where a supplier is liable for tax purposes. There are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <\/p><p>  The main rules that apply to the calculation of the value of contracts are as follows:<\/p><p>  -  the calculation should be based on the total amount payable or the total value of the contract and, in the case of frameworks and contracts divided into lots, the amount is the total value of all potential contracts to be awarded under the arrangement;<\/p><p>  -  all financial and non-financial elements that may be paid are counted including payments from third party sources (i.e. co-funded projects); and,<\/p><p>  -  the estimated value of the contract must take into account the estimated total amount, including all options and renewals (even if those options or renewals are not subsequently exercised) and all other types of payment made to all candidates or tenderers.<\/p><p>  In relation to how VAT and other taxes are assessed when tenders are being evaluated, the position is as follows:<\/p><p>  -  Tender value is assessed exclusive of Value-Added Tax (VAT). This is because of the variety of VAT rates in operation across the EU. In this regard, it is worth noting that where a successful supplier is located in another EU Member State and the annual value of a foreign supplier's distance sales to this State exceeds &euro;35,000 the supplier is obliged to register for VAT in this State.\u00a0<\/p><p>  -  All other taxes would be included in tender price.<\/p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The most recent data available on above EU threshold awards relates to 2011 and is as follows: <\/p><p>  -  Approximately 10% (valued at &euro;240M) of the total known awarded contracts above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.

Despite a public advertisement and a site notice, there were no third party objections to the issue of this permit.<\/p><p>   I have also been informed that the facility has been subject to a series of inspections by Dublin City Council staff.  I understand that a number of issues were identified by the council prior to June 2013.  However, I am informed that during six inspections since June 2013, no issues of concern were observed.  I understand that the City Council is satisfied that the waste facility concerned is complying with the terms of its permit.  While the company continues to raise concerns about the impact of the adjacent facility on its business my Department and its agencies have no power or role in the matter.<\/p><p>  Finally, I have also consulted recently with Enterprise Ireland.  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that they are continuing to liaise with the company concerned, as one of their client companies, and will continue to assist them in any way possible within the Agency&rsquo;s statutory remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[10015\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will indicate, in tabular form, the total expenditure by his Department on external consultancy advice services, including legal services, in 2011, 2012 and 2013; if this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>The following is the total expenditure incurred by my Department in respect of external consultancy advice services, including legal services, for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Expenditure<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;209,486.79<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;523,715.28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;216,315.32<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  My Department is fully committed to achieving the best value for money in respect of the expenditure of public funds.

The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits.

The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits.  This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  I should add that the recent changes protects 100% of pensions in payment up to &euro;12,000 per annum and 90% of pensions in payment between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.

In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal.  The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. <\/p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL01750"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[9739\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600075#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 13<sup>th<\/sup> January 2014.

I am very aware of the serious challenges facing many pension schemes at this time and the efforts being made by both the trustees and the sponsoring employers of these schemes to meet these challenges. You will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits. Prior to this change, the trustees of a pension scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits. The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits. This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. <\/p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. <\/p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. <\/p><p>  In relation to the matter of representation by deferred scheme members in consideration of a change to scheme benefits, this is a matter which needs to be considered in a broader industrial relations context. I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600076#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":328,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Data","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600076#WRM01550"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[9905\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600076#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who have availed of the special dietary supplementary welfare allowance scheme each year for the past five years.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>Diet supplement, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is payable to qualifying persons who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition. <\/p><p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.

It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices in the community. <\/p><p>  That said, the Deputy should be aware that operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the Board and management of An Post and not one in which I have a statutory function.  As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. <\/p><p>  It is for that reason that I am very pleased that the decline in post office numbers has been arrested. Figures in the Grant Thornton report show that, although there were 197 closures between 2006 and 2010, from the end of 2010 to date 17 closures have occurred.<\/p><p>  The reports undertaken by the Irish Postmasters' Union and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the future of the post office network are a comprehensive collection of thoughts, issues and opportunities concerning the post office network and set out many options for exploration in relation to the future development by An Post of the post office network. <\/p><p>  An Post has undertaken a programme of capital investment particularly in the computerisation of the post office network including the automation of all post offices. As a result, the post office network stands well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions. Any such developments would, of course, need to be subject to public procurement requirements as appropriate.<\/p><p>  On the 25th February, I welcomed the fact that the Government has agreed to my proposal for a whole-of-government consideration, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, of the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public using the post office network as a front office of government. This whole-of-government analysis will be undertaken in the first instance by the Cabinet committee on social policy with a view to a report to Government by that committee. This will afford an opportunity for a holistic review of the range of services which could be provided by the post office network and could perhaps yield synergies among the different agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600078#WRO00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600078#WRO00650"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[10009\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600078#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will indicate, in tabular form, the total expenditure by his Department on external consultancy advice services, including legal services, in 2011, 2012 and 2013; if this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The aim of the review was to target the grants at those in greatest need, spreading the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the schemes. A template for the revised application form was circulated to local authorities recently.

As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  Thankfully, we had a long overdue break in the weather last week and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.<\/p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.  The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.<\/p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.  The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve modest increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the north west.  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.<\/p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  Minister Burton&rsquo;s Department runs a number of schemes to support people in circumstances of loss of income.<\/p><p>  While the co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed Regulation establishing the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, it will not be adopted in law until probably June this year.  My Department is working to prepare a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  Decisions on what to do with the finite resources available to Ireland under that Operational Programme will be a key element of that work and I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature from both a legal and practical perspective to consider employing the EMFF to assist fishermen in the present situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600083#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600083#WRT01850"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[9804\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600083#WRT01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding REP scheme payments in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>The person named commenced REPS 4 in May 2009 and received payments for the first four years of their contract.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programme has been provided to my Department for these schemes. <\/p><p>  For&oacute;ige is in receipt of funding from my Department to support the provision of youth services throughout the country.  In 2014, this funding, under the various youth services schemes and programmes will amount to some &euro;7,054,419.  The establishment and development of the Big Brother Big Sister programme by For&oacute;ige was funded by philanthropic sources.  As this funding  came to an end, For&oacute;ige sought alternative funding for the programme.  <\/p><p>  My Department, as with all Government departments is required to deliver significant savings on the major funding schemes that it administers, including the youth services funding schemes.  In responding to requests for funding for the Big Brother Big Sister programme from For&oacute;ige, my Department has explained the very significant funding constraints applying to the youth services grants schemes.  My Department has nevertheless sought to assist For&oacute;ige to maintain the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  In 2011, For&oacute;ige following an internal review of the organisation's wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister programme, nationally.<\/p><p>  For&oacute;ige decided to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their youth information services to the Big Brother Big Sister programme.

A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.<\/p><p>  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  A number of European court cases also have addressed this issue and highly complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen.  I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution.  This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill. I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.

This decreased enrolment has resulted in a significant reduction in the funding to which the service is entitled.  <\/p><p>  The ECCE programme provides for one year's free pre-school attendance for each eligible child before commencing primary school.   Funding of &euro;28,750 has been provided to date for this school year to this childcare facility under the ECCE programme and further payment will issue for the remaining terms of the school year.  This funding is also based on verified returns submitted by the service for the eligible children enrolled.  There is no provision under the CCS or ECCE programmes to provide additional funding over and above that generated by the returns submitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600085#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600085#WRV01650"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[10008\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600085#WRV01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will indicate, in tabular form, the total expenditure by her Department on external consultancy advice services, including legal services, in 2011, 2012 and 2013; if this spend is in line with the overall value for money objective of her remit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy that all contracts entered into by my Department must conform to the relevant laws and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on Public Procurement.

While these services are in the process of being reconfigured under the HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years), it is important to note that all HSE areas have significant services in place for children with disabilities aged up to eighteen years.  These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.<\/p><p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  <\/p><p>  Almost 60 geographic-based multidisciplinary teams have been established to date under the Programme as part of the reconfigured service model.  It is hoped that a further 30 teams will be reconfigured this year, bringing the overall total to approximately 90 teams by the end of 2014.  These figures reflect all children's disability teams that provide early intervention and school age services to children aged up to eighteen years.  The transition to this new model is taking place on a phased basis and, importantly, includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, such as service users and their families.  <\/p><p>  Within this context I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information requested concerning early intervention services for children with disabilities living in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Meath and Louth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600086#WRW01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Delays","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600087#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[9791\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600087#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an appointment will be provided in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork who has been referred to South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital for orthopaedic treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":588,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,<\/i> has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS). <\/p><p>  Our approach to future provision for our older people is not a short-term one as has been suggested. We are acutely aware of the demographic trends and of their implications for future service provision and these are under active consideration. The NHSS Review, which will be published in the coming months, will contribute to this process.  The Terms of Reference for this review are as follows:  <\/p><p>  Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation &ndash;<\/p><p>- To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,<\/p><p>- To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices,<\/p><p>- Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,<\/p><p>- To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and<\/p><p>- To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<\/p><p>  It is expected that the Review will be completed by Q2 2014 and the report will then be made publicly available.  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of recommendations arising from the review may require amendments to the NHSS Act 2009.  <\/p><p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939m. It is estimated that this will support over 22,000 people this year in public, private and voluntary nursing homes.  In order to be an &lsquo;approved nursing home&rsquo; for the purposes of the NHSS, all private and voluntary nursing homes must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. If price negotiations break down a three stage review process, developed by the NTPF, can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.<\/p><p>  We are committed to the provision of a quality public nursing home service underpinned by a regulatory system of registration and inspection. It is the responsibility of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to assess whether residential services are providing high quality, safe and effective services and supports to residents, and to ensure that any issues or deficits are addressed to the satisfaction of the Authority.  In this context the HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet residential need now and in the future.  <\/p><p>  While there will of course always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as it is viable for them to do so, and it is Government policy to develop this approach.  Accordingly in 2014 there is an enhanced focus on home and community supports.  Provision for community and home-based services are being strengthened by &euro;23m to allow more people to stay in their own homes for longer. This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315 provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.<\/p><p><i>  The Government for National Recovery, 2011-2016 <\/i>  commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services, which will be subject to HIQA inspection. Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services. This is being considered in the wider context of the licensing of Public and Private Health Service Providers.  In the meantime, the HSE is already progressing a range of measures to ensure that home care services, provided either directly by the HSE, or through external providers with HSE funding, operate to a high standard. These measures will have a very significant impact on overall standards. <\/p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that one of the key priorities identified in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014 is the implementation of a Single Assessment Tool (SAT) for older people. This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependency levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the NHSS, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for this Government.  The funding that is available for services for older people must be balanced across all of the various service areas in a way that achieves the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritises areas of greatest need as far as possible. Resources that are available will continue to be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600088#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund Issues","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600089#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[9865\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022600089#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the development by the National Treatment Purchase Fund of a clear and transparent pricing policy-model which provides a fair price for patient centred care to be undertaken as a matter of priority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The analysis and the report is about the quality of the selected indicators and data not the quality of care.<\/p><p>  This analysis of HIPE data was a process that involved ongoing discussion with the HSE. During 2011 the analysis highlighted a number of variations with a small number of hospitals being identified as outliers for certain indicators. There are a lot of possible explanations for these variations including issues relating to the coding of the principle diagnosis, coding of the healthcare records to the HIPE system, inclusion of confounding factors in the analysis of the indicators and quality of care. However, this analysis of the data does not allow for an underlying variation in the quality of care to be excluded. Therefore it was necessary for this information to be reflected back to the hospitals as only the hospitals are in a position to assess their data to determine the reasons for the variation.

BreastCheck has a clear commitment to providing transparent information to women invited for screening - with the benefits and limitations of screening clearly explained. Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years due to the combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.

This leads to less extensive surgical treatment, a better chance of good recovery and improved quality of life.<\/p><p>  BreastCheck is fully audited against a range of quality-led criteria including those published in the BreastCheck Women&rsquo;s Charter.  BreastCheck seeks to achieve or surpass standards set down for breast screening, including those outlined in the Charter, and outcomes are reported in the BreastCheck programme report (most recent figures relate to 2011).  BreastCheck provides comprehensive and transparent information and encourages woman to share in decision-making regarding treatment.
