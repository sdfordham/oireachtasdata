We have been at the forefront of delivering animal welfare services for over 60 years and we are also an umbrella organisation for 19 local SPCAs throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>The ISPCA is an animal welfare organisation.  We are not an animal rights organisation, and it is important to point that out.  We recognise that animals are used in a number of ways and our objective is to prevent cruelty but also to promote kindness to animals.  We pride ourselves on the fact that our policies are evidence based and ethically sound.<br\/><br\/>The ISPCA has a team of eight uniformed inspectors, represented here today by Conor Dowling.  Currently, those eight inspectors can only cover 17 counties, although eventually we hope to cover the entire country.  Our inspectors are authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act by means of a service agreement with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is pertinent to point out that there are some exemptions to our authorisation, including that we do not exercise a function under the Animal Health and Welfare Act in respect of a greyhound racing establishment operated by the Irish Greyhound Board or a greyhound breeding establishment within the meaning of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Since becoming authorised officers, our inspectors have initiated over 70 prosecutions, 28 of which have been finalised in the courts to date, with eight in 2017 alone.<br\/><br\/>We have a series of animal welfare policies.  The most pertinent one today is that we are concerned about certain sports requiring the breeding of large numbers of animals in order to select the fastest, strongest or fittest, thereby giving rise to a large number of animals that are unwanted or have no value, and essentially are a waste product<b>.  <\/b>The ISPCA believes in engagement, and we do engage with the greyhound industry through the International Greyhound Forum, which consists of represents from the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club, the Greyhound Board of Great Britain and a number of animal welfare organisations, including our organisation and Dogs Trust, representatives of which we are here with us today.<br\/><br\/>Our main concerns in terms of welfare within the greyhound industry are for dogs that are injured or that are disposed of inhumanely which, regrettably, does happen.  We know a large number of dogs are surrendered to dog pounds for euthanasia once they become valueless.  Over a six year period, 3,410 greyhounds were surrendered to pounds.  We welcome the reduction over that six year period but that is a lot of dogs.  It causes some members of the public considerable distress that dogs are surrendered for euthanasia.  We believe that the cost of that should be borne by the industry; I believe the polluter pays principle applies in this regard.  The burden to re-home them seems to be passed on to rescue organisations.  I point out that 75% of greyhounds surrendered to pounds were euthanised in 2010 compared to 55% in 2015.  There has been a reduction, which is welcome, but we still believe it is too many.<br\/><br\/>It does not help the greyhound industry's case when previous members of the Irish Greyhound Board make comments.  For example, on radio recently, when asked if it was considered to be acceptable for large numbers of dogs to be killed as the result of a sport, the person in question replied, &quot;Absolutely I do&quot;.  That kind of attitude does not go down well with the public and perhaps a culture change is required in that regard.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the heads of the Bill, the committee has our written submission in which our comments are detailed but I will highlight one or two aspects.  We are concerned that there seems to be an apparent move away from criminal sanctions towards administrative sanctions in some cases.<\/p><p>We believe there should be a significant deterrent for people who are determined to commit offences, either internal or criminal offences.  <\/p><p> The Greyhound Industry Bill presents opportunities in terms of amendments to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  For example, we would like to see an amendment to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act that would limit the number of countries to which greyhounds can be exported, the so-called white list.  In that regard, we support Dogs Trust and its Bill to introduce that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kelly.

They will have seen our written submission so I will quickly go through some key points and not keep them too long.<\/p> <p>  This draft Bill provides an opportunity to protect Irish greyhounds from export to countries for racing where there is inadequate welfare legislation or welfare standards which are far below that which we have in Ireland, such as Pakistan and Macau, in China. <\/p> <p>  Dogs Trust is Ireland's and Europe&rsquo;s largest dog welfare charity.  In 2016, we re-homed 2,853 dogs.  We never put a healthy dog to sleep and take a cradle to grave approach to all the dogs in our care.  We do not receive any Government funding, and it is with thanks to our tens of thousands of amazing supporters across Ireland that the far-reaching activities of Dogs Trust have had an impact throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the general scheme of the Greyhound Industry Bill 2017 and we hope that through thorough investigation and scrutiny from stakeholders and legislators we will provide the best legislation possible to protect Irish greyhounds.  In our submission to the committee the members will find a number of proposed amendments to the general scheme of the Bill for the protection of greyhounds, but due to time constraints today I will focus on what we consider to be one of the most crucial from an animal welfare perspective, namely, the export of greyhounds for racing to countries with inadequate welfare legislation and deplorable animal welfare standards.<\/p> <p>  No legislation exists in Ireland which prevents the export of Irish greyhounds to countries where welfare standards are below that which we have in Ireland.  We are proposing an amendment to the Greyhound Industry Bill which provides for a regime to ban the export of greyhounds for racing, and we hope the committee will support this amendment.  I refer members to Annex I of our written submission.<\/p> <p>  We have engaged with the greyhound industry in Ireland through the International Greyhound Forum, which was established almost 13 years ago by the former CEO of Dogs Trust, Ms Clarissa Baldwin, to ensure the welfare of greyhounds is at the core of the industry.  Starting from a low base, significant improvements have been achieved through the work of the forum, which has developed a mutual respect and understanding between the industry while rigorously pushing for improvements in animal welfare standards at all levels.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, grave concerns have been raised about the export of Irish greyhounds to race in countries where the welfare standards are poor or non-existent.  One such case which was highlighted in national and international media in May of last year was when 24 Irish greyhounds were stopped at Heathrow Airport while being exported to Macau, in China.  To be clear, the Yat Yeun Canidrome in China is cited as one of the most deplorable racing tracks in the world.  Loud music is played on race night to drown out the cries of the 800 greyhounds living there.  The track provides little space for greyhounds to turn around in their steel cages, and there are little to no veterinary services for dogs when they become injured.  That is one of the reasons they are often destroyed in the most cruel and inhuman ways.  Ultimately, no dog retires from the Canidrome; they all die there.<\/p> <p>  Those 24 Irish greyhounds did not make it to Macau simply because their cages did not meet the transport requirements and so they were returned to Ireland.  I mention this case specifically because it is one which has been well documented; many other greyhounds are exported for racing and are untracked and untraceable.  This case led to a petition with over 65,000 signatures and demonstrations in Ireland and outside the Irish Embassy in London as well as calls from worldwide animal welfare organisations for the Irish Government to ban the export of greyhounds to China.  Not only are these scandals incredibly difficult to read about as a nation of animal lovers but they are seriously damaging to Ireland's animal welfare reputation.<\/p> <p>  As I am sure the members are aware, Deputy Tommy Broughan introduced a Private Members' Bill to amend the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 on 21 March 2017.<\/p><p>This Bill, if adopted, will allow for the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum, IGF &ndash; Dogs Trust, ISPCA, PAWS, Retired Greyhound Trust in the UK, and the Irish Blue Cross - and a representative of the veterinary profession along with the IGB to produce a draft list of countries that meet minimum standards with regard to the welfare of greyhounds and to which licensed export of greyhounds from Ireland can be permissible.  This draft list will be open to public consultation for a minimum of 30 days.  The final list - the white list - will be submitted to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and will be revised annually.<br\/><br\/>Following discussions with other welfare organisations and with a number of public representatives, we believe that the provisions set down in the Bill tabled by Deputy Broughan could be integrated into the Greyhound Industry Bill.  Given the support publicly provided by the greyhound industry for the prevention of the export of greyhounds to countries where the standards are below those in Ireland, we see no reason not to introduce this sooner rather than later.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 4 May, the Minister fully endorsed the IGB's advice to only export to destinations with sound welfare standards.  We do not wish to see Irish greyhounds treated in a way other than they are treated in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Ultimately, Dogs Trust and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum as well as the wider Irish welfare community want more robust regulation throughout the industry with better welfare provision for greyhounds before they get to the track, when they are racing and when they are retired.  Dogs Trust is not calling for a ban on the export of greyhounds <i>per se<\/i>but, as a society, we have a duty to protect the animal which gives its all during its short racing career.  As an animal welfare charity, our main concern is that welfare standards are appropriate to ensure the protection of greyhounds and that they are adhered to.  Our current view, which I am sure all members will share, is that changes are required to the current legislation to safeguard the well-being of our greyhounds. <br\/><br\/>I thank members for their time and I welcome any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzie Carley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carley.

I am a greyhound owner and the director of a greyhound track and, therefore, I have a serious interest in the industry.  Our industry has received a great deal of negative attention in the past few months.  The industry's participation regarding the welfare of greyhounds must increase.  Anyone who is serious about the industry recognises that.  While I may not agree with everything the witnesses said, they have made many sensible points observations, which have to be taken on board and examined in the drafting of this Bill.  Dr. Kelly said the ISPCA receives 16,000 calls each year about cruelty to animals.  What percentage of those calls relate to greyhounds?<\/p> <p>  Ms Carley gave examples of countries to which greyhounds are exported where standards are a long way below ours.  If we are serious about greyhound welfare and enhancing the image of our industry going forward, the legislation must prohibit the export of dogs to countries where standards are significantly below those of Ireland.  Who will set down criteria for the countries to which the dogs are exported?  Do we have the ability to determine fairly for or against an importing country?  Ms Carley cited one country as an example and I accept that.  I discussed this issue with greyhound owners last week in the context of another country.  I thought its standards were not that high but I was assured that the conditions in which the greyhounds are kept are absolutely superb and the country's standards are even higher than ours.  Just because a country is outside northern Europe does not mean it its standards are below an acceptable level.<\/p><p>What format do we have?  Is there a body that will be acceptable to everyone with regard to the standards?  Will standards be agreed?  How can we do this for the various countries to which greyhounds go from Ireland?<\/p><p> The industry must recognise that it has a responsibility to contribute to the welfare of greyhounds.  The day of leaving it to someone else to deal with retired greyhounds is over.  Whether we will be able to cater for every case economically is an argument, but breeders, owners and the industry as a whole will have to make a financial contribution to try to secure homes for retired greyhounds and the welfare of greyhounds.  There is a percentage of dogs which must be euthanised.  It is a prerogative that the industry bears its share of responsibility and its share of the cost.  Our industry has suffered a lot of damage in recent months.  If we are to protect the image of our industry going forward, we must have greater participation in dog welfare.  Anyone who is serious and interested in the industry will accept this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#J00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The recommendation on the export of dogs is sensible and should probably be included in the Bill.  Obviously we only want to see dogs exported to countries with proper welfare standards.  The ISPCA spoke about authorised officers, and the fact it is not authorised under the under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 but is authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  There is provision for the board to appoint authorised officers.  As the legislation stands, could ISPCA inspectors be appointed as authorised officers by the board?  Is it something that would meet its requirements with regard to welfare checks?<\/p> <p>  It was stated that people convicted of animal welfare offences are not excluded from being on the board, but under head 6 they will be excluded from being members of the board.

Is there a rationale for this other than the desirability for fewer litters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#K00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the two groups for their excellent presentations, which were succinct and very informative and all the better for it.  I am somewhat surprised that legislation on animal welfare seems to be deficient with regard to the ISPCA's authority to enter establishments.  If possible, we should examine whether an appropriate amendment can be made to incorporate greyhound establishments as being establishments within the meaning of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  It seems to be a significant lacuna in legislation.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out this is significant legislation the sole aim and focus of which is to incorporate the welfare of greyhounds from the cradle to the grave.  Much work has gone into the legislation, including by the committee's predecessor and this should be acknowledged.  Every Member is aware and awake to the situations that can arise, but we must not tar everybody with the one brush.  There are people in all walks of life who may not take appropriate care of animals in the way we would like them to.<\/p><p>It is important that the vast bulk of people involved in the industry as owners, breeders, trainers and everybody else do their very best in this regard.  Anybody who does not take appropriate care or who behaves in an inhumane fashion in any form has to be excluded, whether that is from boards or from participation.  Deputy Pringle is correct.  I thought that this legislation was taking steps along those lines, as outlined by the witnesses.<\/p><p> Head 9 deals with the provision with regard to welfare.  Clearly, most groups have indicated that this is not all-encompassing.  It is pretty weak, if I was to summarise what many of the witnesses are saying.  That can also be related to the level of funding referred to by the ISPCA of &euro;2.4 million versus &euro;60 million, which is a comparison of what the ISPCA and all of the groups involved in the animal welfare industry get to affect the greyhound industry with what the greyhound industry gets.  There is a factor of almost six or seven of a difference.  Have the witnesses any view on what additional funding might be needed to improve the greyhound welfare?  What level of additional funding is required for the enhancement of racing greyhound welfare?  The Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017 has been published by our colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan.  It is clearly something that has a significant degree of stakeholder interest.  Can the witnesses comment upon that?<\/p><p> Some of the witness organisations are members of the greyhound forum already.  I think the ISPCA is as well.  How does that work and does it need to be strengthened?  We have ten or 12 pieces of legislation.  Some of that emanated from the witnesses themselves advocated strongly in this regard.  What more needs to be done in that regard?  Does it need to be strengthened?  Does there need to be a statutory format to give the forum more teeth?<\/p><p> With regard to criminal sanctions versus the administrative sanctions, the witnesses are clearly not fans of the administrative sanctions.  Where would they wish to see criminal sanctions being imposed?  We saw from the Morris report that one of the big problems in the industry is doping.  Apart from other welfare areas, is that an area the witnesses believe should be subject to criminal sanction?  Where in this Bill can criminal sanctions be introduced to deter people from abandoning animals or doing anything else?  Animal abandonment seems to be fairly significant.  That seems to be the genesis of the witnesses' plea that numbers would be curtailed.  The witnesses were comparing Ireland to Britain in terms of numbers.  How could one implement that?  It seems that we would be better off working at the welfare end of it rather than having a restriction on numbers.<\/p><p> The Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017 is something in which we can implement particular standards, even though they need to be strengthened.  Nevertheless, there is a good corpus of legislation dealing with welfare standards and we should acknowledge that.  If there is a deficit of welfare in countries in which greyhounds or indeed any animal are being exported to, then we should call a halt to that straight away.  That is apparent.  As Deputy Cahill said, we cannot have a preconceived notion about this.  It has to be established beyond a doubt.  Sometimes one might say that a certain country is not an acceptable place.  We cannot do that.  It cannot be based on anecdotal evidence.  It has to be based on very strong empirical evidence for us to do those things.  There is no use taking a blunderbuss approach and then living to regret it.  We have to be careful to do the right thing for the protection of animal welfare, but we must do so based upon evidence as opposed to hunches or anecdotes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#K00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The witnesses are all very welcome.  With regard to the number of litters, what is the norm at present?  I would like to know this for my own expertise, if nothing else.  With regard to sanctions, it was stated a person convicted of any animal welfare offence should not serve on the board.  Surely such people should not own greyhounds or be involved in the industry at all, never mind be on the board, at least for a period of time.  I would like to tease this out a little because it seems a little strange that this would be the only sanction.  I am sure it would not be that big a sanction to be taken off the board.

As we are not authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts to investigate in licensed greyhound premises, we defer to the IGB on those calls.

The number of registered greyhounds involved is small.  We deal with many greyhound-type dogs, which fall outside the industry, but the number of calls received about registered greyhounds is negligible.  We must acknowledge that the majority of dogs kept for racing are looked after in an appropriate fashion.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Pringle and Penrose asked whether the ISPCA could be authorised under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act or whether authority could be extended under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts.  They are both possible.  There are weaknesses in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act.  It requires people to do things but if they fail to do them, there is no facility to act on that unlike under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts.  For example, the IGB was dealing with a case to the best of its ability involving a large of number of dogs in a compromised welfare scenario.  The board served a welfare notice but the person failed to comply with it.  If such a notice is served under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts and the person fails to comply, we can take action to seize and remove animals to ensure their welfare.  There is no such facility under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act and, therefore, this case rumbled on for two years through the courts.  During this time, the dogs continued to be kept in conditions that nobody was happy with, particularly the IGB.  That aspect needs to be examined, particularly if the industry is to be largely self-regulating.<\/p><p>I know that the stewards on the ground would appreciate a little more strength in their armoury in trying to deal with these situations.

Whether one receives the maximum fine is another issue.  That is a decision for a court to make.  We believe, however, a reduction of the penalty would be a retrograde step.  Abandonment, which I am thankful we do not see very often these days, is another potential serious offence.<\/p> <p>  I believe I have answered all Deputy Penrose's questions.  I shall move on to the questions of Deputy Martin Kenny.  He asked me to state the current norm for the number of litters.  I am not sure what the average number is.  I do not know whether Mr. Conor Dowling would know.  With regard to sanctions, there has to be a significant deterrent.  There is the option within the draft Bill for exclusion orders, for example.  I believe, however, that this has to be across the board for offences rather than for specific technical offences.  It would be useful to see full exclusion orders.  There are some potential breaches.  There is the potential to exclude from race grounds or from public sales, but one could just have somebody else go to the public sale.  A full exclusion order might be better in those circumstances.<\/p> <p>  We have covered the exportation of greyhounds.  The Deputy asked about chipping.  It is now an offence not to have any dog microchipped in Ireland.  We conducted a survey with UCD that showed that approximately 85% of dogs are now microchipped.  It has been a success.  It remains to be seen whether that impetus will continue.

On tracing and trackability, one of the ways in which we would like to see the exportation of greyhounds tracked and traced would be through the pet passport scheme that is currently in operation so every dog exported from Ireland would go under that scheme.  We propose that when the owner is seeking to export the greyhound, they would go to the IGB, which would have to annotate the pet passport to sanction it and say the greyhound may be exported to the country in question.

Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy, with new lending of &euro;6.7 billion last year.  Our share of the new SME and agriculture lending market is over 50%.  We have the largest retail network in the country.  The overall agriculture or primary industries loan book has de-leveraged by approximately 9% since 2014.  During this period, Bank of Ireland has managed to increase its loan book by 8%.  We have done that by having over 50% of the flows in the market.  We see the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland cashflow scheme as an opportunity to further expand our participation in that segment of the market.

I will also provide some commentary regarding our status with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland scheme.  As Mr. Cunningham has outlined, Bank of Ireland has consistently provided in excess of 50% of all new lending to the agriculture sector in recent years.  New lending to agriculture so far this year is in line with the same period in 2016.  In line with the recovery in commodity pricing in certain sectors, we are seeing an increased volume of applications for funding, particularly from dairy farmers.  Average farm overdraft utilisation in 2016 was 21%.  I believe this is an excellent measure of the financial robustness of the sector as a whole.  Allowing for seasonal variation, there has been no material change in agriculture cashflow performance so far this year.<\/p><p>I wish to bring the attention of the committee to the third slide in the bank's presentation, which provides up-to-date information.  As of close of business on Friday, 5 May, Bank of Ireland had agreed to provide &euro;65 million under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland agriculture cashflow support loan scheme.  Demand for loans has exceeded all of our expectations.  Within four weeks of the start of the scheme, the bank had received 1,900 applications for inclusion in it.  To date, the bank has issued loans worth &euro;39.1 million, which represents 60% of our total commitment to the scheme.  We are committed to having &euro;65 million fully drawn as quickly as possible.  We expect that the vast majority of the funds will be drawn by the end of June.  As members of the committee can see in our documentation, the beef and dairy sectors account for 85% of all funds drawn to date and 87% of all applications drawn to date.  We had expected to see a greater appetite for funding from the tillage and pig sectors, but this has not transpired.<\/p><p> Bank of Ireland's average loan size under this scheme is &euro;29,000 and its average loan term is 31 months.  Approximately 38% of all funding drawn to date is for a loan tenure of four or more years.  Beef farmers, who typically require funding to purchase stock, have received 57% of all Bank of Ireland funding drawn to date.  This funding is normally loaned over a term of up to 24 months.  Some 24% of funding has been provided for terms of between two and three years and 38% of funding has been provided over a 12-month term.  Loans worth &euro;12.7 million have been approved but have not yet been drawn.  A further &euro;13.2 million is to be processed to approval stage in fulfilment of Bank of Ireland's commitment under the scheme.  As a result of the receipt of such a volume of applications within such a short period of time, there have been delays in processing those applications.  We expect to have all applications processed within the next two weeks.  Bank of Ireland's priority is to get the loans drawn as soon as possible.  We estimate that more than 2,100 loans will be drawn by our customers under the scheme.  I thank the members of the committee for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The only additional comment I wish to make in the context of our discussion on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland scheme is that Bank of Ireland recognises the issues and challenges faced by the agriculture sector in the Brexit negotiations and discussions.

I am AIB's head of agriculture.  I am joined by Mr. Ken Burke, who is AIB's head of group credit products, and Ms Catherine Moroney, who is AIB's head of business banking.<\/p> <p>  I refer the members of the joint committee to the slides that were circulated in advance of this meeting.  As they are aware, 2016 was a challenging year on a number of fronts for Irish agriculture.  Most sectors experienced a price-related downturn, while others fared better.  The UK's decision to leave the EU and the rise of protectionism across key global markets has now signalled a new era for trade that will undoubtedly have an impact on agricultural commodities.  AIB is acutely aware of the ongoing challenges facing the agrifood sector.  We are particularly aware of the potentially significant impact of Brexit on the sector and the anxiety that is causing for processors, food manufacturers and farmers.  It is generally accepted that its greatest impact will be on the meat sectors, most especially the beef sector, cheddar manufacturers and consumer food businesses, including SME food businesses.  While our treasury teams continue to support the sector at all levels in the bank - corporate, business centre, branch and direct - we are working with customers to understand the implications for their businesses and to learn how best we can support them.  To that end, we have just appointed 21 Brexit advisers, who will support our customers and our frontline staff in navigating the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit.<\/p> <p>  As price takers, farmers have no influence on external events that may have an impact on the prices they receive.  Their only option is to look inside the farm gate and to seek to make their enterprises as efficient and resilient as possible.  Grass utilisation is of key importance in this regard in the livestock sector.  AIB has committed a substantial investment over four years in the Teagasc-led Grass10 initiative, which seeks to increase grass utilisation and cost efficiency on livestock farms.<\/p><p>AIB is committed to playing its part in the concerted national effort to minimise the negative impact of the UK's decision.  <\/p><p> AIB has a long and enduring association with the Irish agrifood sector.  The bank is now the main lender to Irish farmers and AIB accounts for more than 40% of total Irish farm lending.  We are all aware of how critical agriculture is to the economy, jobs, individuals, families, communities and broader Irish society.  It is a core part of our SME strategy, which was cemented in the 1970s with the establishment of an agri-advisory team.  Today, this experienced 16-strong agri-sector team, all of whom are agricultural science graduates, is regionally based. The main role of the team is to provide objective farm financial and technical analysis to the bank in individual farming cases, in addition to supporting bank staff.  <\/p><p> In general, aggregate farm debt in Ireland continues to decline from a peak in 2009.  However, we have seen strong demand for new lending in recent years as farmers invest in their enterprises.  The dairy sector continues to be a key driver of on-farm investment and, in recent years, the beef sector has also invested significantly.  Our analysis of market predictions from the main forecasting agencies indicates that the medium-term outlook for global agricultural commodities remains positive.  On this basis, AIB maintains a good long-term outlook for agriculture, while recognising that challenges in each of the production areas exist.  In fact, agriculture has experienced comparatively lower levels of credit difficulties than other SME sectors.  AIB is very happy to support ongoing investment in this industry.  <\/p><p> Despite the challenging price environment experienced by most farmers in 2016, AIB's new lending to farmers increased marginally on 2015 levels.  There was no significant increased demand for working capital in 2016.  Overdraft utilisation levels at the end of March 2017 were on par with the same period in 2016 and 2015.  Notwithstanding the buoyant cash flow position of the sector last year, AIB undertook the following supports specifically in regard to cash flow: proactive contact with dairy and pig farmers; proactive contact with the main dairy processors in regard to farmer support; agri-adviser presentations on cash flow planning at over 30 industry seminars; and the publication of customer information on farm cash management.  <\/p><p> According to the AIB agri-financial services research of July 2016, undertaken by Ipsos MRBI, almost 40% of farmers have no bank borrowings.  In addition, research suggests that four out of ten farmers plan to invest in the next three years.  This is higher among dairy and commercial farmers.  To support those farmers that do have a requirement for bank funding, AIB has a range of products, bespoke and general SME, to support farmers needs.  In November 2015, we launched our second &euro;500 million fund to support on-farm capital investment and working capital.<\/p><p> Farmers use a variety of mechanisms to manage working capital, including bank funding and merchant credit.  Depending on the nature of the enterprise and the working capital cycle, AIB has a number of options available, including a business overdraft, seasonal stocking loans, prompt pay and the farmer credit line.  A farmer may avail of one or all of these in combination to support his or her working capital.  <\/p><p> AIB's farmer credit line is a unique product which seeks to provide a flexible approach to managing farm working capital.  For planned seasonal expenses, farmers can draw down funds from a credit line to their current accounts and have flexibility to repay within the year as they have funds available.  This product is competitively priced and farmers may currently avail of a typical rate of 3.825% variable.  AIB has a range of options to support capital investment on farms.  Farmers can avail of our on-farm capital investment loan, which is priced at 5.5% variable, a 1% discount on our standard variable business loan,<\/p><p> Aside from the cash flow support scheme, AIB is the leading lender of SBCI SME funding, the sector having availed of &euro;400 million to date.  This was made available at a rate of 4.5% variable, a 2% discount to our standard business variable rate, and can be used to finance most on-farm capital investment.  Farmers have been keen to avail of these SBCI funds, accounting for 27% of the total AIB draw downs in 2016 and quarter 1 of 2017.  In addition, we also offer asset finance to support investment in machinery and equipment.  As with all SME investment the term of the loan is typically linked to the useable life of the asset.<\/p><p> Following the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, of the plan to introduce a &euro;150 million agri-cashflow support loan scheme, AIB engaged with the SBCI to participate on the basis of a &euro;60 million loan fund.  Given the tight timelines from announcement to expected launch of the fund, we applied significant resources to our participation in the scheme and to developing a product which would enable our customers are avail of this funding is efficiently as possible.<\/p><p> The scheme features and eligibility criteria were set out by the SBCI.  The key features of the scheme were a maximum loan amount of &euro;150,000 per farm enterprise, loan terms of a minimum of one year of to a maximum six years, loans that are unsecured, optional interest only repayments provided at the start of loans and an interest rate of 2.95% fixed for the term of the loan.<\/p><p>The SBCI also set out key criteria relating to how loans should be used and who can apply, as well as eligibility criteria.  As with all similar schemes in which AIB participated, normal lending terms and conditions applied.<\/p><p> Having had previous experience of administering SME funding from national and European funding agencies, we anticipated some complex elements in this scheme.  As such, we supported the launch internally and externally with significant resources to help our staff, customers and their advisers to fully understand the details of the scheme.  Following the launch of the scheme, we hosted 30 external briefing sessions across our 19 local markets for stakeholders including accountants, Teagasc advisors, agricultural consultants and farming organisations.<\/p><p> Given that this scheme was first announced in early October 2016, we envisaged significant pent-up demand.  AIB&rsquo;s fund opened on 31 January and closed on 2 March following a strong pipeline of applications.  We are currently processing all outstanding applications as full information is received from customers.  When all applications are completed, the fund will have been oversubscribed.  AIB has taken the decision to accept all applications received by the closing date at the same rate of 2.95% fixed and subject to the same terms and conditions as the SBCI cash flow support loan scheme.<\/p><p> As of last Thursday, 4 May, 62% of our applications have been processed and sanctioned, and the funds are now available or have already been drawn down by customers.  The dairy and beef sectors account for the majority of the applications and funds sanctioned.  However, all sectors benefited from the scheme.  Of those loans that are fully processed, 72% of funds have a term of greater than four years and 23% have a term of 13 months to four years, while 5% have a term of one year.<\/p><p> AIB has been pleased to have the SBCI cashflow support loan as a component of our suite of financial supports for farmers in 2017.  We reiterate that farming remains a core business sector for AIB.  It has always maintained a through-the-cycle view of the agri sector, recognising that there will be a mix of good and bad years.  As a leading bank to the industry, we will continue to play a key supporting role in the development of an efficient and sustainable agriculture industry in Ireland.  <\/p><p> On behalf of the bank, I want to again express thanks to the committee for inviting us here today.  We very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this key SME sector and welcome members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us here today.  We welcome the opportunity to talk to the committee about Ulster Bank's participation in the SBCI agricultural cashflow support loan scheme and our support for the agrifood sector.  I am Ulster Bank&rsquo;s senior agricultural manager.  I am joined by my colleague, Eddie Cullen, managing director of our commercial banking division.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank is the third largest bank in the Republic of Ireland.  It is unique as the only systemic bank that operates in the Republic of Ireland owned by a parent with international reach.  Our strategic ambition is to be the number one bank for customer service.  We are focused on making Ulster Bank a customer-centred bank that is simpler, more agile and offers an appealing alternative to the dominant players in the market.  We recognise the importance of agriculture to the economic and social fabric of the country.  It is a core part of our business.  <\/p> <p>  The improved economic and market sentiment and higher demand for credit has continued into 2017.  We firmly believe that for the Irish economy to continue to recover, it is essential that there is competition in the banking market.  We are determined to provide that competition across all the sectors in which we operate.  <\/p> <p>  The agriculture sector is a key component of our business and accounted for 22% of our total SME business lending in quarter one of 2017.  This activity was primarily driven by our existing customer base renewing their annual working capital facilities and the extension of new term debt to farmers seeking to expand and-or modernise their farm businesses.  This activity was most evident in the dairy and poultry sectors.  Our banking relationships in the agrifood sector start with the many farmers who bank with us, and include agribusinesses from artisan food producers up to the largest multinational food manufacturing businesses.  Our relationship with many of these customers stretches back for decades. <\/p> <p>  At Ulster Bank, we have skilled managers who understand farming.  Our agri-training programme is accredited by Chartered Banker and 66 of our colleagues in our credit and front-line teams have completed this course.  Due to the calibre and success of this Ulster Bank developed programme, it was adopted by the Institute of Bankers as a module in 2016 and is now offered to employees of all financial institutions, as part of its professional diploma in SME credit.<\/p><p>At Ulster Bank we understand the agrifood sector and are committed to supporting both individuals and enterprises, from farmyards to boardrooms, in a focused, structured and strategic manner.  We also recognise that lending must be responsible and based fully on a farmer's ability to generate cash flow to repay debt.  We take a long-term view of agricultural lending, recognising the inherent volatility in farming.<\/p><p> Through our close interactions with all stakeholders in the dairy industry, we realised in 2014 that dairy farmers might face some cash flow challenges in 2015 and 2016 owing to a low milk price.  This coincided with a time in which many dairy farmers were expanding, post-milk quota abolition.  In response we developed the Ulster Bank Dairy Farmer Toolkit as part of our proactive support for our dairy farm customers.  The toolkit provides solutions for farmers with options such as increased working capital facilities, an interest-only option, or a combination of both, depending on individual circumstances.  The dairy sector which has attracted most commentary is not the only farming sector in Ireland to experience cash flow difficulties.  The pig and tillage sectors have struggled with low prices for a number of years, while both the beef and mushroom sectors have been impacted on in recent times by the uncertainty caused following the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union.  Ulster Bank offers support and solutions to all of its customers during periods of pressure, once the underlying core business is sustainable into the future.<\/p><p> The increased volatility evident in the agriculture sector in the past few years due to weather, price or unexpected individual on-farm challenges is a reality that the sector must learn to manage.  Farmers must continue to improve on-farm efficiencies and competitiveness to survive the income cycles which are becoming the norm.  At Ulster Bank we believe the production and utilisation of grass on livestock farms drives efficiency.  We introduced a pasture loan in 2015, which provides finance for grazing infrastructure, drainage, re-seeding and soil fertility measures.  We continually encourage all farmers to analyse their costs of production, compare them to those of their peers and adopt best technologies.  The preparation and utilisation of a cash flow budget are also key tools required to manage a farm business effectively.  Ulster Bank believes all farmers need to continue to develop a broad range of skills.  Greater understanding of technical efficiency, people management and business skills are required to successfully develop farming operations in this increasingly uncertain environment.<\/p><p> As part of our meaningful help and support measures for farm families we ran regional seminars in Limerick and Donegal entitled, Building Capabilities on Farms.  The seminars brought industry experts and sectoral intermediaries together to enable the attending farmers to discuss and seek advice on solutions and strategies to help to address volatility in their businesses.  We had representatives from Pieta House and Mental Health Ireland at both events to recognise and support the need for mental well-being, as well as financial well-being, on farms.  They stressed the importance of talking, listening and seeking regular downtime from the stresses and strains of running a farm business.<\/p><p> At Ulster Bank we continually provide additional help and solutions for our customers through the publication of articles, participation in various fora and conferences, as well as sponsoring some key agricultural events.  In July Ulster Bank will partner with Teagasc Moorepark to support its biannual open day.  The theme of the event, Resilient Technologies, will provide dairy farmers with the opportunity to view and discuss the latest developments in key dairy technologies to help them to manage present day challenges.   These factors are firmly embedded in the Ulster Bank business and credit strategy for the farm sector.<\/p><p> Through the SBCI agricultural cash flow support loan scheme, Ulster Bank was allocated &euro;25 million.  Approximately &euro;6 million of this fund has been drawn-down, with an average loan size of more than &euro;50,000.  Based on our drawdown figures to date, we anticipate that 500 of our customers will benefit from the scheme.  An initial analysis of the loans also indicates that they mirror Ulster Bank's geography and farm sector concentration profile.  The majority of funds were allocated to assist with working capital in 2017.  There was strong demand to assist with the purchase of trading stock, fertiliser and feed.  The funds will be used as an alternative by farmers to merchant credit.  Our customers also sought funds to replenish working capital previously used to support capital expenditure on farms.  There were also funds requested to clear super levy, revenue and merchant credit bills.  The vast majority of applications received through the scheme were approved.  However, a small number of applications were declined owing to the farm business being in financial difficulty or because the purpose of the loan did not meet the scheme eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>Where the purpose of the loan did not fit the eligibility requirements but repayment capacity was evident, we provided support through our other business products.  There were also requests to refinance existing term debt and for new investment which were not permitted under the scheme.  <\/p><p> With regard to the term of the loans provided by Ulster Bank, we aimed to match the tenure with the purpose of the loan, within the confines of the scheme.  For example, a farmer who had bought weanlings in the spring of 2017 with the purpose of selling them as stores received a loan for 12 months, while a farmer who had financed the partial construction of a milking parlour from working capital in 2014 was subsequently able to finance it over a six-year period, the maximum term allowed under the SBCI scheme.<\/p><p> I reiterate that Ulster Bank is committed to the agrifood and farming sectors.  Our aim is to partner with farming businesses to enable them to grow and to continue to play our part in supporting the agriculture sector through the difficulties that arise.  We have developed flexible solutions for our customers, including the Dairy Farmer Toolkit, pasture loans, as well as participating in this scheme.  Ulster Bank looks forward to further engagement and collaboration with all stakeholders in the industry to consider a range of options to address the fundamental difficulties facing the sector.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for affording Ulster Bank the opportunity to address the committee.  Mr. Cullen and I will be happy to address questions members may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the three banks for their presentations.  The representatives of Bank of Ireland have said 1,900 applicants were successful, whereas the representatives of AIB did not give a figure, but Ms Finnegan said the bank had catered for everyone up to 2 March, four weeks after the opening of the scheme.  Dr. Byrne has said Ulster Bank closed the scheme after two weeks.  The window of opportunity for farmers to avail of the loans was extremely narrow.  How much more demand do the banks believe there was for the scheme?  I was approached by a number of farmers.  At that time of the year they are busy and do not frequent their banks on a regular basis.  When they inquired about the scheme, it had closed.  If more funding had been available, would there have been a greater take-up?<\/p> <p>  The scheme was introduced because of the poor product prices in 2016.  I cannot understand the poor take-up of the scheme by farmers in the tillage and pig sectors.  Is it because they applied and were refused on the basis of their repayment capacity or did they just not apply?  Are they considered to generate such poor returns for the banking sector that they knew an application would not bear fruit?  Last week we received a presentation from the SBCI which also referred to these sectors.  In particular, the officials referred to the horticulture sector and the financial difficulty growers got into following the Brexit referendum.  It is hard to understand how there has not been a great drawdown by producers in these sectors under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I am wrong, but I thought the scheme was introduced to address existing merchant debt and farmers who had financial problems as a result of the 2016 crisis when product prices fell.  I did not think it was a scheme to provide stocking loans in 2017.  Ulster Bank outlined clearly that it was used for such loans this year.  My interpretation of the presentations made to the committee by the Minister and the Department is that such loans were not envisaged under the scheme.  I have concerns that it was used by the banks for business that they would have been doing in the normal course with farmers this year.<\/p><p>It was certainly not my understanding and it is the one point in the presentations today with which I have serious difficulty.  I would like a discussion about it.  Merchant credit bills, super levy bills and even tax bills with Revenue were built up due to cashflow problems in various sectors in 2016.  That was my understanding of why this was introduced whereas this is definitely not something for which I envisaged the scheme would be used.  I would like to hear the views of the three banks as to why it was used for the purpose of stocking loads for 2017.  That is not my understanding of the purpose of the scheme.  The three banks have in common the fact that the scheme closed very quickly within them.  Can they give us a handle on how much more demand is out there?<\/p><p> The duration of the loans is the other issue with the way the interest subsidy will work.  I have definitely had a number of farmers on to me who were unhappy at the duration of the loans they received.  They felt there was significant pressure placed on them by financial institutions to reduce the loan terms.  From a cash-flow point of view for farmers, the longer the loan goes on at this interest rate, the more beneficial it is for their businesses.  I might have missed the data but AIB definitely indicated that 72% of the loans were over four years.  Bank of Ireland said the average loan term was 31 months.  There was definitely an emphasis on reducing the terms of the loans.  What are the banks' views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#X00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>We will take Deputy Martin Kenny's questions before going back to the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#Y00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>The witnesses are all very welcome.  I thank them for attending and making their presentations.  A couple of issues arise immediately for me.  The advantage of the scheme was that the money was available without security being required.  It was sold on that basis.  However, everyone I speak to in the farming community went to the banks with which they deal generally and with which they all have security down.  Their deeds are already there.  The advantage of that is difficult to understand.  Having said that, access to capital has been one of the major issues not only for farmers but for the whole population for the last number of years.  It is good to get it and to be able to use it appropriately.  I share Deputy Cahill's analysis that much of this money was used for issues with which the banks were already dealing.  That is one of the problems we have with it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I have relates to the value of it.  The wholesale interest rate from the European Central Bank is very low, which is one of the issues raised with us all the time.  Across Europe, the European Central Bank is providing money to every banking institution.  The Irish banks are charging almost double what every other bank in Europe is charging, not just to farmers but to every sector.  I ask the witnesses to explain to me who is creaming it off.  It is certainly not farmers and businesspeople.  It is a real issue for people with mortgages and across the board.  It is not fair that Irish people are paying far above the odds.  My view is that the banks got into trouble and ran into a whole series of debts which they are screwing the Irish public to pay off.  I would like the witnesses to find some way to assure me that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#Y00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  Deputy Cahill asked about the level of demand.  Last year, we provided nearly &euro;400 million in lending to farmers in the primary producer sector.  We had an allocation under the scheme of &euro;65 million.  As such, it is the level of demand as a proportion of the overall level of agriculture lending we plan to do in 2017.  As my colleague, Mr. John Fitzgerald, has indicated, we expect demand to be broadly similar to 2016.  One can assume that there will be a commensurate level and a commensurate increase in demand for farmers who qualify under the scheme.<\/p><p> As we indicated earlier, 57% of the scheme funds so far have been used by farmers as stocking lending.  That is permitted under the scheme.  It is one of the conditions that is allowed.  We did not indicate or devise the scheme in that regard.  As a result, if people qualify under the scheme, we are in a position to grant them facilities.  There is no doubt that there are large levels of merchant debt among farmers.  We have constantly indicated that they can refinance that more cheaply with the bank.  Average merchant debt trades at probably 1.5% per month and we encourage farmers constantly to look at refinancing it with the bank with normal banking facilities.  For a variety of reasons, they chose not to do so.  Consequently, a number of farmers have not chosen to refinance merchant debt under the SBCI scheme.<\/p><p> Approval rates in respect of the pig and tillage sectors are no different than other approval rates under the scheme.  We did not have any reason to believe there would be lower levels of demand from the pig and tillage sectors than from the sectors from which applications came.  Certainly, there was no bias on our part or among proponents of the scheme nationally such that pig or tillage farmers were not in a position to apply.<\/p><p> I was asked about access to capital by Deputy Kenny.  All the banks will indicate to him that there is no shortage of capital available for the agriculture, SME, or, indeed, any other sector in Ireland.  All the banks are willing to support farmers and provide them with facilities as they look to expand and grow their enterprises.  Deputy Kenny also referred to the level of interest rates.  Unfortunately, there is a great deal of misinformation out there about the level of interest rates and the comparable rates across Europe.  We have done detailed studies and analysis of the whole market.  One of the findings when one considers the SME and agriculture sectors across Europe is that the Irish market has three main characteristics which differentiate it.  First, over 85% of lending in European markets is for one year or less whereas over 48% of lending in the Irish market is for more than three years.  Second, on average in Europe there are upfront fees for lending of between &euro;40 and &euro;100 with a subsequent 0.4% to 1.6% rate for facilities.  When one adds the fees in respect of one-year facilities to the interest rates, one gets a very different picture.  Third, there are mutual guarantee and co-operative schemes in the agriculture sector across Europe, which are not available in Ireland.  That was one of the problems this scheme attempted to address.  Over 15% of lending in Europe comes with the benefit of the guarantees from those mutual guarantee schemes, which we do not have.  All that tends to alter significantly the level of interest which is ultimately charged to farmers.<\/p><p> When the SBCI, the EIB and KfW were working with us to devise this scheme, they analysed the pricing mechanisms and the manner in which banks and financial institutions priced their products to the market in considerable detail to determine the pricing for the scheme.  As I am sure Mr. Nick Ashmore indicated to the committee, the effective pricing for the scheme was designed to ensure there was no net benefit to the banks and financial institutions.  In effect, the subsidies and additional premium paid to the banks brought the pricing levels up to the levels at which the banks were able to put credit out into the marketplace.  A straight comparison between one interest rate and another is far too simplistic.  Any suggestion that we are ripping off the people of Ireland and that our European counterparts are being more munificent is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  I note to Deputy Cahill that the total number of applications to AIB was 2,188.  It is not surprising that the take-up figures in the tillage and pig sectors are low in comparison to other sectors given the number of operators in those sectors.<\/p><p>We work on the basis of approximately 200 commercial pig farmers and 1,000 commercial tillage farmers out of 6,000 overall.  It is reasonable that the beef and dairy sectors account for the majority of the debt outstanding, as they are the predominant sectors.<\/p><p> Within AIB the demand from the tillage sector was particularly localised.  From the latest figures last week, the tillage sector accounts for 6% of the funds drawn down or funds ready to be made available to be drawn down.  That is what we would have expected.  For the pig sector, the figure is similar to what the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, reported, namely, 1%.  In respect of both but particularly the tillage sector, our experience is that demand was localised.  For example, the majority of demands at the Enniscorthy branch are from the tillage sector.  Demand in the pig sector would not be as concentrated, but it would be localised to some degree.<\/p><p> We have a strong market share in the pig sector, banking with some of the best and most efficient pig operators.  It has been our experience in the pig sector that it goes through cycles over many years.  The capacity of the most efficient pig sector producers to ride through these cycles is remarkable.  To some degree, it is not surprising that they were able to come through last year because they had a lot of form in doing so.  They are quite adept at managing through the lean years.<\/p><p> Mr. Cunningham has addressed the issue of utilising the funds for cash flow in 2017.

We were clear and explicit to our own people internally on the features of the scheme.  We were conscious that we wanted to reduce complexity for farming customers.  We did not change our application form and did not introduce additional complexity.  Rather, we equipped our relationship managers with the information required to obtain the information the SBCI needed for the scheme.  That was important.  Any assertion that there may have been a focusing on shorter terms cannot be borne out by the numbers about which we have spoken.<\/p> <p>  As for the demand for the scheme, I agree that it was filled in a short window.  As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we catered for some customers beyond the terms of the &euro;60 million fund to which AIB had subscribed.  We did not want customers to be disadvantaged because the shutters had come down on the scheme after a short time.  We have honoured these commitments.<\/p> <p>  On average interest rates, we are acutely conscious of the needs of the agriculture sector.  Beyond the &euro;60 million scheme, we are a long way through our second tranche of funding of &euro;200 million from the SBCI.  We have had broad SME funding of &euro;400 million.  Agriculture has been the largest sector to avail of that funding.  It has been offered at a rate of 2% below our standard variable loan rate.  It has been active for several years at a rate of 4.5%.  On the demand for schemes such as this, in particular, working capital, in its product suite AIB has a farmer credit line which we believe offers a market leading rate of 3.825%.  For customers looking for low-cost working capital funding, that is a product that is freely advertised and available to customers.  It works alongside their overdraft facilities and can be accessed online.  Within our product suite we have low-cost funding available to farmers.<\/p> <p>  We saw strong demand for the scheme.  Was some of that demand accelerated by the window of opportunity?  Possibly, it was.  When we look at the growth of our agricultural lending in the first quarter, we suggest some people were making applications for credit they might not use until later in the year.<\/p><p>For north of 60% of scheme funding applications have been booked.  There were some customers, however, who were prudently planning to meet working capital requirements throughout the year, given that the terms of the scheme allowed for funds to be drawn by the end of December.<\/p><p> On Deputy Martin Kenny&rsquo;s other main point about interest rates, AIB has passed on four standard variable rate reductions to mortgage customers.

We then look at the term the business could sustain without putting undue pressure on it in the medium to long term.  While it is a feature of the scheme, it is something we do periodically to relieve working capital pressure in sectors during downturns.  One is looking at a period of two to four years, depending on the nature of the build-up of credit and what the business can sustain.  Under the SBCI, if one was looking at trading stock which would be sold within 12 months, the appropriate term would have been no more than one year, again without building pressure into the following year.

In many cases, we engaged with our customers on the application where they had funded capital expenditure from cash flow for several years and, ultimately, that was the source of the pressure.  Rather than take a credit bill from 2015 and pay it over a longer period, we looked to split it and apportion the expenditure based on what it had been used for.  If it had been used to fund the extension of a shed in 2015, potentially it was a six-year loan, whereas if feed and fertiliser made up half of what had been applied for, it could be included in a two-year loan.

This drove the high initial demand for the scheme.  Today we have a limited waiting list of people who wish to avail of this product, if more funding becomes available for the scheme.<\/p><p>It is not a very large waiting list.  The policy of a first come, first served basis drove people to apply for the loan within a very tight timeframe.<\/p><p> Let us consider the low take-up by the tillage and pig sector.  The people who work in the pig sector sought larger loans and the full amount of &euro;150,000 from the Ulster Bank.  The loan has been used to clear their merchant credit bills that had built up over the past number of years, a situation that was driven predominantly by a low price for pigs.  Ulster Bank has taken out some of their merchant credit bills, up to the maximum of &euro;150,000, for the full six years of the loan.  We did so due to the uniqueness of the pig sector and the current market.  <\/p><p> Ms Finnegan commented on the tillage sector.  The sector has become localised around the main grain growing areas here.  It has been affected by adverse weather and low prices for a number of years.  Prices will remain an issue for the sector this year.  The people who work in the sector have sought loans to pay off their merchant credit bills and provide working capital to buy fertilise seed and sprays for the 2017 growing season.<\/p><p> Stocking loans have been predominantly addressed.  A stocking loan was deemed suitable for the scheme.  As the scheme was ran on a first come, first served basis the farmers approached us for stocking loans and we provided them.   <\/p><p>  We provided the loan terms to match the purpose.  As I said in my opening statement, if the purpose was to purchase stock that would be for sale within a 12 month period then loans were given for up to 12 months.

Ulster Bank has an opportunity to compare Ireland and the UK, particularly in the area of SME franchises.  We have seen little different in SME margins between this economy and that of the United Kingdom, which reflects some of the points made by Mr. Cunningham.  The economy in the banking sector is similar in Ireland and the UK when compared with the Continent where there are some significant differences.  Another issue came out in the presentation made by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  It revealed that the capital held by Irish banks, on balance, is higher than the capital held by European banks.  I will put that in a more technical manner.  The risk weighted asset intensity in an Irish bank is significantly higher than a European bank.  Some of that is due to the legacy position because the capital one carries relates to the recent impairment.  That is just the technical way that capital is calculated in banks.  I do not think one can say any Irish bank is creaming it when one considers the returns in capital being generated by Irish banks is, in general, in single digits.  That is the reality of where we are at.  It is important to make a distinction between how the European economy operates versus how the Irish or UK economy operates.  That drives some of the differences.<\/p> <p>  I will add, in terms of the presumption that there was some sort of targeting of the tenor.  In Ulster Bank, as I think in all banks, we proactively engaged with the Department, the Minister and the SBCI when the product was put to us.  There was a very narrow window to carry out a lot of work to get the product ready and make sure our front-line staff were ready to deal with the product.  In our business, as the committee has heard when Dr. Byrne made her presentation, there was a very narrow window when the applications came in.  We did a lot of overtime and weekend working was necessary to deal with the volume of applications.  We took the product at face value and delivered it to the market and our customers, based on where the demand came from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for attending.  Like my colleagues, I was disappointed with the take-up, particularly by the horticultural sector.  I thought part of the programme was to deal with cashflow, support, and addressing the impact of sterling, the exchange rates and lower product prices.  I was disappointed that the horticultural sector did not  get much from the scheme even though it has liquidity issues.<\/p><p>It has been said that there was a limited opportunity.  Nevertheless, there appeared to be a great rush to pull down the shutters on the scheme.  Having heard the AIB's presentation, I wish to acknowledge that it did the honourable thing.  As far as I can ascertain, the AIB ensured that anybody who had applied for the scheme, notwithstanding that the bank had run out, it extended the same terms to everyone who applied.  Am I correct in my assessment of the situation?  If so, fair play to the AIB for doing so.  I wish all of the other banks had followed suit.  I wish to acknowledge AIB for its efforts now <i>in lieu<\/i>of what I will mention later. <br\/><br\/>I thought this scheme would provide a flexible source of working capital and it would be used to pay off the more expensive merchant credit, etc.  Like Deputy Cahill, having read the presentations, did the banks handle the scheme for the prospective period going forward rather than retrospectively?  I thought the loan would be used to pay off debt that had accumulated on a retrospective basis.  Unfortunately, that message has not been conveyed in the presentations.  Perhaps I have misinterpreted the presentations.  I would like the matter clarified. <br\/><br\/>What amount of subsidy did each bank receive for administering the scheme?  The SBCI had made &euro;25 million available.  What was the period involved?  <br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding all that has been said about capital ratios and legacy issues, it is hard to dispel the public notion and viewpoint that banks rob people, particularly as interest rates are punitive.  The credit union movement has a multiple of billions of euro but it is compelled by law to place its deposits with the banks.  However, the banks charge the credit unions for the privilege.  What has happened to all of that money?  We have made loans cheaper.  If the banks are compelled by law to make the money available then why not do so at a cheaper rate?  A sum of &euro;9 billion is a lot of money but the credit unions have not got much of a return.  The credit union movement would rather invest in property.  Again, due to legacy issues the movement is prevented from investing in property and that is why it has sought alternatives.  Perhaps the credit unions can help alleviate the mortgage problem and  build houses.  I hope that the Government will grasp the opportunity and allow the credit union movement to operate in the housing sector.<br\/><br\/>How does each bank deal with bad debts?  Every business has bad debts.  I have experience of how one of the banks cut off its overdraft facility for small businesses in the midst of the crisis.  That was unhelpful to small businesses and I have real evidence to support my claim.  Can the banks assure us that they have no plans to hive off agricultural debt, or people who are in debt, to the vulture funds and they will be allowed to borrow from the banks?  Can the banks guarantee that such debts will not be hived off to vulture funds?  Only four months ago Ulster Bank was involved in a situation where debts were going to be hived off to vulture funds.  We all know what vulture funds have done to people.  I hope that the banks are not planning to hive off debts to the vulture funds.  People borrowed in particular circumstances and had a particular concept.<br\/><br\/>I have always held the view that if everybody levels this charge against anybody, let it be in any industry, small, medium or large, farming or anything else, that if there was imprudent borrowing then there was certainly imprudent lending.  It takes two to tango.  I would be deeply concerned that vulture funds would ever become part of the norm.  I would support laws that would curtail such a scenario because I have seen the damage that vulture funds inflicts on people.  I hope that the banks will give an assurance that vulture funds will not form part of future developments in the banking sector.<\/p><p>Many people have suffered.  A lot of people would state everybody has suffered except the banks.  This is a well held and well-founded perception.  It may not be a perception, it may be reality, which is different to perception.<\/p><p> We have come through the rough times, and it is individuals and businesses who have come through the rough times in this regard.  The Irish people have put their shoulders to the wheel and saved the banking system.  I hope there would be reciprocity from the banking system now towards people who may find themselves in extreme difficulty.  What is the average overdraft rate charged to the farming community?  People can borrow money for virtually nothing.  Ulster Bank made a comparison with what is available in England because it has a reach into England, and that is fair enough.<\/p><p> My colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il are still concerned about mortgage charges and its spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, tabled a Bill which went through the D&aacute;il.  He did not do this off the top of his head.  He did it because of significant public requests.  The witnesses are dealing with a specific sector of banking so I will not ask them to deal with the mortgage situation.  It reflects the overall view and where people are at.  What is the standard margin the banks charge over the European rate at which they borrow?  What is the administration cost of the loans?  What are the built-in margins?  There are administrative and handling costs and we appreciate this.  They must be covered and business is business.  There has been a contraction in some of the banks of the availability of service to the public, and there have been closures in recent times and announcements of closures throughout the country.  This must be taken into account also.  In this regard, what is the standard margin at which the banks operate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#CC00500","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I do not want to go over the points already made.  It strikes me from what has been said that the structure of the fund is such that the margin to the banks at the end of the day is similar to what they would get in the normal course of lending.  The product to the farmer is cheaper, but the margin for the banks is the same.  Whether they were to lend through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, fund or to continue to lend through other products they have available is neither here nor there because of how it is structured.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the structure?  What is the percentage administration fee they receive?  How much of the reduction in interest rate is down to the fact that default is guaranteed by the SBCI?<\/p> <p>  Another issue which has been touched on is the length of loans.  There is a &euro;150 million loan fee, and &euro;25 million of this is a combination of Exchequer and European funds.  This money, if I am correct, is used for the administration fee payment to the banks as well as the guarantee aspect of it.  The calculation at the outset would have allowed for a fund of &euro;150 million.  This was supposed to be for up to six years.  Was the &euro;25 million of Exchequer and European funding sufficient to cover the cost if all the lending handed out was for a six year term?

With regard to the localised impact on the sector last year in certain parts of the country where people lost crops, did the banks see a take-up in the areas which were most affected?  I know it was localised and it was a small proportion.  Certainly the Government and the Minister indicated it was their intention this would be something which would support the sector.  Did the banks see any evidence of this with regard to how it was drawn down?<\/p><p> AIB indicated it is taking all applications.

All banks in the eurozone have been under significant pressure from the regulator of the ECB on their non-performing loan books to try to reduce the percentage of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets and ensure they are open for business and are making credit available to customers.<\/p><p>In our case, Ulster Bank was not part of NAMA.  We were bailed out by the British taxpayer, not the Irish taxpayer.  We were not part of NAMA so we carried all that non-performing debt on our balance sheet.  We engaged in loan sales.  The last such loan sale, which was labelled Project Oyster, last year included some designated farmers, and we would have engaged with lots of stakeholders, both farming bodies and politicians.  As we explained at the time, the \"farm debt\" we sold as part of that last loan sale was farmers who had off-farm debt, typically commercial real estate.  We did not sell any debt that farmers had borrowed for the farming enterprise.  Our experience historically over the many decades we have been involved in agri-lending is that farmers who invest in the farming enterprise perform very well when one takes it through the cycle view.<\/p><p> We have now reduced the non-performing loans on our business banking side to a relatively low level.  As to whether I can predict the future and say it will never happen again, I cannot say that.  Ulster Bank has come to a much more normalised level of non-performing loans on our business banking balance sheet.  That has been a very positive thing for Ulster Bank in terms of its go-forward position and its ability to work with customers and make new credit available off a loan book of a little over &euro;5 billion.  We advanced new credit of &euro;1.3 billion into the economy of the Republic of Ireland last year, which relative to the overall size of the Ulster Bank book is a significant level of new credit.  About half of that was to new customers as opposed to new lending to existing customers.  I hope that gives members some clarity on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#FF00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#GG00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  In response to Deputy Penrose's question on the horticulture sector, I tend to agree with Dr. Ailish Byrne that it is small in terms of the number of operators and the debt levels in the sector.  I think that is the reason it is not featuring in the overall numbers and is not coming out strongly, but that is not to say those in this sector have not availed of support under the scheme from AIB.  On the question of working capital for 2017, it was legitimately part of the scheme eligibility criteria and farmers presented with applications for that purpose, and where their applications were successful, we honoured that and met the needs of others who had pent up demand for working capital.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy McConalogue's question on the tillage sector, we worked with the tillage farmers who were affected on a localised basis in and outside the scheme.  I cannot speak on the figures because I have not looked at the breakdown along the west coast and in particular branches.  That is an ongoing tillage sector.  Dr. Byrne is correct that the challenges the tillage sector and some operators faced last year were more pronounced given the weather difficulties they experienced.  There are strategic challenges for the tillage sector.  This is the fourth year of depressed prices, which is putting significant pressure on tillage operators, particularly those who are working on large scale conacre and trying to service it on an annual basis.  When one looks at the stocks to use ratio internationally, in the past we would have said that a weather event would sort out the problems with the level of stock build ups that are there, not that we wished for a weather event in any part of the world.  That is not the case at present.  It would take three or four weather events to sort out the type of stock build ups that we are seeing in the tillage sector globally.  We are seeing the impact of the access to technology, particularly genetically modified organisms, GMOs, across the world.  Every year the tillage harvest globally is high and that is putting pressure on Irish operators.  Apart from the impact of the weather on certain individual tillage farmers last year and outside of what this scheme could deliver for the tillage sector, there are wider strategic challenges for the tillage sector and, indeed, for the livestock sectors because we need feed security in Ireland in order to sustain the growth in the livestock sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Members had questions on how the scheme operated in the context of the level of Exchequer funding.  I believe the chief executive of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, appeared before the committee.  It was very much for SBCI to negotiate how that operation worked in terms of the funding it had received.<\/p><p>From AIB's perspective, we bid for a certain element of the fund and the arrangement is that there is no upfront payment to AIB.  Effectively, AIB and SBCI agree a list of eligible loans and then in arrears, as interest is charged to those customers, details are forwarded to SBCI.  Within 30 days of receiving that report, SBCI transfers an interest subsidy to AIB.  As Nick Ashmore would have said, the scheme is cost neutral.  Why is it cost neutral?  The answer is that, effectively, AIB opened the scheme to more customers than would normally be eligible.<\/p><p> On the point about customers who were experiencing cashflow difficulty or who did not have collateral to post, we were very explicit that no additional collateral was required and we relaxed our lending criteria to allow more challenged customers into the scheme.  That interest subsidy is paid in arrears.  In the context of the risk sharing element of the scheme, in the unlikely event that an account becomes impaired, we report that to SBCI so the bank will follow it up and chase repayment from the farming customer in the ordinary course of the event.  If there is a loss to the bank, SBCI transfer 80% of that loss in the individual case to the bank up to a cap of 12% of the portfolio level perspective.  There is no upfront payment to the bank - it is very much in arrears - but equally if the bank was to reclaim money from that borrower, we remit the money back to SBCI so there is a net effect in that context.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose raised the question of overdraft rates.  I hope I have dealt with that in the context of AIB's SBCI facility of 4.5% and our foreign credit line of 3.825%, which works alongside the normal overdraft rates.  It is up to customers to decide how they work their overdraft with other forms of lower cost funding.<\/p><p> On the question of the AIB's credit experience with the farming sector, thankfully our loss experience with the farming sector has been much less than other sectors.  If we look at every euro that we have afforded to the farming sector, 67 cent is in credit funds with the bank.  Those amounts are only increasing.  Our loan loss experience with the agri sector has been comparatively better than other sectors and no different from the way AIB works with private customers in difficulty.  Where customers are co-operating, we want to ensure we keep customers in homes and in businesses, and we work with businesses to find an acceptable solution.  That is foremost in our mind, and acutely so in respect of the agri sector.  We acknowledge that some elements of our agri portfolio did go off balance sheet and take on other forms of investments, and we are dealing with those as sensitively as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and I will follow on from Mr. Burke's comments on the nature of the scheme.  There were detailed discussions with SBCI as to the manner in which the scheme was going to be administered.  Effectively, if we look at an unsecured agri rate, the rate is 6.75%.  The rate that has been provided under this scheme to farmers on an unsecured basis is 2.95%.  Effectively, the difference between the 4.95% rate and the 6.75% rate is a form of risk sharing, the different lower capital levels we will require for the lower level of risk we will be taking on because of the guarantee that Mr. Burke referred to.  Detailed calculations were done between Bank of Ireland and SBCI, looking at historic past performance and the average life of the loan book to ascertain what was the appropriate level of discount and the price at which the loans should be offered.  It is not a straightforward subsidy.  When one takes the figure of 2.95% and adds the 2% margin - effectively, a 2% subsidy is given to the banks such that it will cover our credit losses - and given the lower losses that we anticipate and the administration cost, it will be cost neutral for the banks in terms of operating this scheme.  That is the manner in which this scheme was devised.  I have no doubt that SBCI can make the detailed calculations available to the committee, should it look for them.

It was based on a detailed look at the historical loan tenor of the book; the volume that would be in stocking loans; the percentage that would be in stocking loans; the percentage that would be for capital expenditure; and the percentage that may be for land purchase.  Land purchase was excluded from the scheme, so we extracted land purchase from the figures.  The average life of the loan book and the manner in which the loans had performed historically was taken into account with a view to coming up with what would be a suitable average life for the scheme.  The historical credit losses we have incurred on those loans were taken into account.  That was then used to come up with this loan-loss guarantee up to that 80% limit and the 12% cap to which Mr. Burke referred.  All of this gave rise to the 2% subsidy that was arrived at in terms of calculating the loans under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  On the drawdown, unlike other SBCI funds which are capable of being redrawn, there is a hard stop on this money in that the money must be drawn down by 31 December.  If the money is repaid earlier, the money here under the scheme is not capable of being redrawn.  There is a finite life to the scheme.  Hopefully that clarifies its nature.<\/p> <p>  There has been considerable discussion about tillage farmers.  Over 70 tillage farmers have already drawn down loans under our scheme.  Some 9% of our loans have been for tillage farmers and the average size of the loan for tillage farmers in the bank's case is &euro;45,000, which is higher than the &euro;31,000 average for the rest of bank's customers.  I would not like members to be under the impression that tillage farmers have been excluded.  Indeed, as a percentage of the overall size of the loan book as has been indicated, there is a proportionate level of drawdowns in connection with that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked about the margins and the average price.  Margins and bank margins are a matter of considerable scrutiny and debate by analysts.  Banks call out the net interest margin as a topic in their results and statements.  In Bank of Ireland's case, we have a net interest margin on our lending of between 2.23% and 2.26% on our loan book over the course of the past 12 or 18 months or so.

How is this scheme expected to play out in the future?  Will it be the model that will be used for banking and financing of agricultural products in future or will it be a once-off?  The Government has already put money into TAMS and other products.  Is this the appropriate way for the Government to put finance into the agricultural sector, which would be a major change in policy?  Is this the appropriate model for the future?  Should there be a scheme like this every year.  Given that some banks had this scheme filled in 19 or 20 days, the appetite for this scheme was absolutely amazing.<\/p> <p>  A key aspect of the scheme is the six-year term.  Many farmers were under the illusion that they would have the ability to draw money down over six years and have the first two years interest free.  They were deeply disappointed when they went through the process.  Some 30% of the farmers got the money over a one-year term, which was not what they were looking for.  They were hoping to spread the money over a longer term, but did not have that opportunity.  With 30% of farmers having it paid back in one year, it is a major issue.  We need to look at the criteria.  Those figures were produced last week by the banks themselves.<\/p> <p>  I believe 19% of the farmers got the money over six years, which was the big thing for the farmers.  They looked at the scheme as one where the first two years were interest free with the principal paid off over the following four years, but only 19% of farmers availed of those full terms and conditions.<\/p><p>Should the terms and conditions be broadened so that the majority of farmers could have the opportunity to use it over six years?  Many in the farming community look to hedge their bets and put term loans into a period of five, six or seven years.  Very few have the capacity to pay it off in one year.<\/p><p> I ask about the terms of conditions the banks then applied on this loan.  Was the policy that farmers who got this loan were required to clear existing stocking loans?  Were they required to produce letters of security from solicitors regarding payment of these loans?  Did the banks look for security, which would be in contravention of the scheme itself?

As he may be aware, there are considerable EU constraints and restrictions on the manner in which the scheme could be used.  If the SBCI, the Government or anyone else wishes to introduce a scheme, all the banks have indicated that we are more than happy to co-operate to figure out how it can be done.  Members have seen that this is of a very limited nature with a very hard drawdown time stop on it.  It does not seem likely to be a blueprint for schemes to be looked at in years ahead.  However, should the Government wish to pursue it, we would be more than happy to facilitate it.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the term of the credit scheme received some airing earlier.  The point that may be being missed here is that normal bank terms and conditions apply to the scheme.  Normal bank terms and conditions apply if somebody has a one-year loan.  Somebody with a one-year stocking loan or other product should only get a loan for that product over one year.  Somebody considering a capital expenditure programme with a longer-term payback on the capital expenditure could get a loan over a longer-term period.  Perhaps in some instances the nature and benefits of the scheme may have been somewhat oversold with the perception that two-year interest-only six-year term loans were being provided here.  However, what was not looked at was the small print.  Normal bank terms and conditions apply.  If the purpose for borrowing this money is for one year or for two year, that is the basis on which the loan should match the term of the asset they are seeking.<\/p> <p>  I have no evidence and would not be party to any suggestion that we were looking for security, given that the security-free nature of these facilities was one of the conditions of the scheme.  I have no evidence of that.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked if the banks are playing catch-up.<\/p><p>All the banks sell in this market is money.  Many people choose to offer credit subsidies or upfront zero percentage interest rates, whether they are selling furniture, cars or trying to buy in milk, to try to entice farmers or purchasers to purchase their stock.  That is clearly something those businesses can do, but it is not something the banks can do.  The banks are making their profits from selling the loans; the banks must make the profits from that loan or lending product.  There is no doubt that, particularly in the milk sector, there is intense competition between the co-operatives for this extra milk and to manage or process it.  Many of the co-operatives may be seeking a way in which they can add additional terms and benefits to their milk processing or milk supply agreements by trying to entice farmers in supplying credit to them.  We have certainly seen it in the motor trade, the furniture trade and the store trade.  It is more indicative of the co-operative sector coming to terms with the rest of the merchandise sector.<\/p><p> In terms of the tillage and pig sectors, we can only speak to our own statistics.  We have seen no suggestion that these people are not in a position to pay their debt or have not been in a position to avail of the scheme.  The numbers we have seen would be broadly commensurate with the level and volume of applications we would see across our book.  Perhaps the timing for the sector might not have been the most appropriate and it might not have been as tuned in, but the volume and level of applications are broadly similar to what we are seeing across our broad book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will respond to Senator Lombard's points.

Certainly, we have not been trying to encourage farmers into shorter term facilities.  I have our brochure-ware with us today.

At this point, we are 42% down on that level of debt in the sector.  That is the overall context in which all farmers are operating.  They have paid down debt substantially.  They took on debt at a period of time to deal with a specific compliance issue and they have paid down debt since then.  Since April 2014, we have brought forward two &euro;500 million funds ring-fenced for the agri sector.  The second of those is almost 90% complete at this stage.  I am confident that we have come forward and made the funds available to the sector, and that there has been an appetite and an uptake from the sector.<\/p> <p>  In terms of dealing with the cyclical issues in the sector, before the difficulties and the volatility we have seen in the dairy sector in the past six or seven years and further back with the cyclicality we would have traditionally seen in the pig sector, it has always been AIB's position to work with the sector on an annual basis to deal with the cyclical problems that might exist.  It is difficult to find one solution that fits all problems and all farmers' difficulties when there is a trough period.  We all need a suite of solutions in our armoury to deal with the nature of those problems in a particular year.<\/p><p>This was a very effective solution from AIB's perspective and we were delighted to have it available to us in quarter 1 of this year, but there are other things we need to do to work with our customers, and not all problems will have been solved with this scheme, nor could they have been solved.<\/p><p> Regarding the pig and tillage sectors, I am confident that our pig and tillage customers came forward to avail of this scheme.  In terms of the pig sector, notwithstanding the difficult margin year that the sector experienced in 2016, we did not see any particular signs of stress in our pig book last year.  We saw quite a bit of investment in the sector last year.  That has been an ongoing phenomenon from AIB's perspective.  We bank a group of very resilient pig customers so when the sector is in a trough, they have a capacity to maintain their position.  That is a testament to the efficiency and financial astuteness in management of the operators in that sector.<\/p><p> This scheme has done what it can do for the tillage sector, certainly in respect of some of the built-up problems that existed from 2016.  We recognise the challenges that exist in the sector.  That has not dimmed our view of it.  It is a critically important sector for Irish agriculture and it is critically important for our livestock sectors.  AIB recognises that the challenge for us on an ongoing basis is to work with our tillage farming customers and look at how they manage their exposure to the grain markets on an annual basis, and how they ring-fence their own position, particularly those people who have large conacre bills on an annual basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017050900002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>To take Senator Lombard's questions first, on the term that Ulster Bank has extended, over 50% of our loans have gone out over the four year period.

Also, people were looking to use it to purchase feed or fertiliser for the 2017 season.  It is good business practice on the part of the farmer that he or she clears that facility after the 2017 period and does not let it run into future years.

Dublin Chamber of Commerce is the voice of business in the Dublin region.  It represents 1,300 members who employ over 300,000 people across the greater Dublin area.  Our membership is made up of a cross-sectoral base spanning the spectrum from start-ups through to multinationals, so we have a good insight into the infrastructure needs of both businesses and their employees over the coming decades.<\/p> <p>  Ireland faces an urban future and we believe the Government must plan for this through proper planning and infrastructural investment.  Urbanisation is an overwhelming international global trend and the UN estimates that Ireland's population will be 75% urban by 2050.  Rather than fighting this the Government should focus on getting urbanisation right, to optimise both social and economic outcomes.  The greater Dublin area is currently home to 40% of the population and it is the engine of the Irish economy, accounting for 53% of GDP.  It generates 62% of tax revenue in Ireland.  For the foreseeable future it will remain the main demographic, economic and cultural hub in the country.  In this urban future Ireland's success will depend on the strength of Dublin.  The growth of the capital city should be intelligently supported, not frustrated.<\/p> <p>  Large infrastructural investments in the greater Dublin area are not just for Dublin.  They have a national impact.  For example, Dublin Airport is not just for Dublin.  It is the national airport and eight out of ten air passengers to Ireland come through Dublin Airport.  Enhancements to the connectivity of Dublin Airport to the city and the rest of the country have benefits for both the greater Dublin area and the country.  The capital investment into Metro North as a key element of that connectivity is, therefore, a priority for Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  Likewise, the DART underground is to be seen as national infrastructure.  While it would connect the two main rail stations it also provides connectivity for Dundalk to Tralee or Sligo to Rosslare, so while Dublin based infrastructure is important for connectivity in the greater Dublin area it has a national impact as well.<\/p> <p>  We ask the Government to allocate resources in a way that respects and reflects where Irish people choose to live in their greatest numbers.  A first step in this regard would be to allow a proper debate on capital investment choices, informed by clear and up-to-date data on relative costs and benefits for the proposed projects.  This information is not publicly available at present.  What is in the public domain is out of date, so we ask for that data to be made available so we can properly inform and comment on it.  Under-investment in Ireland's biggest population hub has negative economic and social effects.  None of these decisions is cost-less.  For example, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in a response to a parliamentary question estimates an annual cost to the Irish economy of &euro;350 million caused by congestion in the greater Dublin area.  This is projected to cost the Irish economy approximately &euro;2 billion by 2030 if serious investment in infrastructure does not take place.  The European Commission has recognised that urban Ireland suffers particularly from shortcomings in infrastructure and that this will be aggravated by rising activity and population growth.  The under-investment in infrastructure is costing us on a number of indices, and the World Economic Forum has highlighted the lack of infrastructure as a bigger risk to Ireland's economy than the level of the country's debt.<\/p> <p>  We believe Ireland must have a new approach to capital expenditure.  In the past we have both under-estimated future infrastructure needs and failed to provide for them.  Dublin is now ranked as the seventh most congested city in Europe, with public transport usage by commuters at only 21.5%.  However, we have seen that where successful infrastructure is built people engage with it.  Connecting the centre of the population with the infrastructure means that people will engage with it.  We need to move the dial on that 21.5% of commuters on public transport.  Our current approach to infrastructure and capital planning is not working.  We have one of the most unstable capital expenditure patterns in western Europe and the lowest proportional capital spend in the EU.  We ask the Government to embrace long-term planning for infrastructure investment.  We should adopt a 20-year capital investment plan that is aligned to other national strategies and supported with long-term fiscal commitments.  Other countries have successfully shown the way on this, so we should seek to have a 20-year capital plan.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, we believe the Government should use the unallocated &euro;2.65 billion to enhance competitiveness in light of geopolitical challenges.  The most pressing of these is Brexit, but there are other challenges.  Maintaining a focus on competitiveness is the key request.  Housing supply, commuting and travel times represent the most practical and quantifiable measures under which the greater Dublin area can improve its international offering in a relatively short timeframe.  Investment in housing and transport will also have a huge impact on quality of life for citizens in Dublin as well as supporting further growth and investment.<\/p> <p>  Metro North and the DART underground should both be prioritised in the capital investment plan.  The Metro North is essential connectivity and it is also essential to easing urban congestion.  Fingal in north County Dublin has a population of almost 300,000.  It is the third most populous county in Ireland and is the fastest growing.  Between the census of 2011 and the census of 2016 the population growth in Fingal far outstripped that of the five counties of Connacht.  We must put investment where the people choose to live.  The DART underground was first mooted in 1971, yet we still do not have it.<\/p><p>Again, there are opportunity costs to that and that has been a drag on the development of the city.  Resources must be allocated to enhancing the existing public transport system, reducing commuting times, easing congestion and better delivery of health and environmental outcomes.<\/p><p> We also believe that Dublin Bus services play a hugely important role in the city's transport system and that bus priority and bus only corridors are a highly efficient way of transporting large numbers of people at peak traffic times.  There are opportunities to upgrade ticketing and payment systems through allowing the use of contactless cards and phone pay, in addition to the Leap card.  Improvements in cycling and walking infrastructure could also be achieved at relatively low cost but with very significant rewards in terms of traffic management and in health and environmental outcomes.<\/p><p> In terms of planning, complementary services such as Dublin Bikes, cycle lanes and bus stops should be located as close as possible to the existing rail stops to enhance commuter convenience and to encourage people to use public transport.<\/p><p> The other key area for capital investment is the Dublin water supply.  The threat to water shortages in Dublin has been internationally recognised, with a Stanford University study in 2014 identifying Dublin as one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to water shortages in the future.  The eastern and midlands water supply project is vitally important and it must not be delayed.  We ask that Government would clarify the implications of the EUROSTAT determination that Irish Water remains on the State's balance sheets, the implications of that for the capital investment plan as a whole and that it commits fully to funding the eastern and midlands water supply project.<\/p><p> That is the summary of our recommendations.  We would be delighted to answer any questions and go into each of those points in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke, and I thank her for her brevity.

I commend their constructive opening contribution which contained many interesting ideas.  The starting point for all of us now in terms of capital spend over the next while will be the national planning framework and how that works out.  The logic of it is good in the sense that it does not seek to take from Dublin.  We need a thriving capital city.  There are capacity issues but there is further scope for development in Dublin.  However, there is a big demand on the State regarding capital spend.  Leaving aside the infrastructural capital projects, some of which Ms Burke highlighted, we also have the need to build the national maternity hospital and the national children's hospital.  We have demands in third and fourth level, where there is a dearth of capital investment, health care and so on.  We then have the need for transport investment and other investments.  That is just in Dublin alone; we have not even gone outside of Dublin.  Obviously, there will have to be a prioritising of what is possible.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to my first question.  Ms Burke cited in her opening statement a greater use of public private partnerships, PPPs.  A number of organisations and witnesses have come before this committee.  Some of them are more supportive of PPPs while some are less supportive.  Some economists have question marks over them and some are more supportive.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has done a good deal of work in this area and it has concerns regarding accountability, a failure to do look-back exercises to see whether we are getting bang for buck.  Before we can embark on more PPPs, there is a school of thought that we should have more hard analysis of whether, as taxpayers, we get value for money for them.  Can Ms Burke give us examples from her perspective of what did represent value for money in terms of PPPs?  How would she respond not just to the Comptroller and Auditor General but also to the many economists on this?  Colm McCarthy has been a strong critic of public private partnerships.  There is a body of opinion on them.<\/p> <p>  My second issue concerns capital spend outside Dublin.  In her opening statement Ms Burke spoke about the need to examine where population growth is in the State.  There is an intention, and it is something that underpins the national planning framework, that we have to build regional cities outside Dublin.  That will require capital spending as well.  How do we make sure we can do all of that while at the same time making sure we have the capital spend for the Dublin area?<\/p> <p>  In terms of my final question, when any group makes a demand for increased resources we have a responsibility to ask how we will pay for that.  The question to Ms Burke and her organisation is that if it is recommending that we increase spending and capital areas, how will that be paid for?  Will it be through cuts in services elsewhere or through increased revenue?  If it is through increased revenue, what are those options?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Ms Aebhric McGibney, to respond on the national planning framework and the PPP question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The history of PPPs has evolved in the past 20 years.  Ireland has become quite good at using PPPs and they are used as an exemplar for some of the projects in terms of how a good PPP project is worked.  The argument used against PPPs generally is that Government financing is cheaper but that misses the point that with regard to private finance, which might have a slightly higher rate, there is a full transfer of risk if it is done correctly.  It will then be off balance sheet, which is the possible solution to Ireland's desperate need to invest heavily in capital infrastructure.  There is a good deal of public debate about whether projects have worked very well and whether the investment is worth it.  There is then scope change and things happen but if we lock down a project and say, \"We would like you to build this and the risk and all the challenges are transferred to the private sector\", there is a huge benefit to that.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the work done by the European Investment Bank, EIB.  A group involving the EIB and the Government is looking at a range of private finance options and getting the EIB involved in supporting projects here.  There is a particular window of opportunity arising from the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union in that there are many officials with expertise in that area.  The EIB, once it comes into a project, would certainly ensure that it was very much above board and of a very high standard.  PPPs have improved as projects and the expertise of the EIB in bringing that on board is an opportunity we should not miss.<\/p> <p>  In terms of value for money, we face a real challenge.  I cannot have a meaningful debate with any of the members without value for money or cost benefit analysis of any capital project because any project over &euro;5 million is assessed by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, given a cost benefit analysis and then the analysis is redacted.  We cannot see the cost or the benefit, so we cannot have a meaningful discussion.  It is beholden on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to produce something more meaningful with which we can engage.  There is a challenge regarding commercial issues.  If I tell the members I have &euro;100 in my pocket, the risk is that any supplier will try to charge me up to &euro;100.  If there is competition in the market among people bidding for projects, one would think it would be less than the &euro;100 in my pocket.  Even allowing for that, there must be a way of ranking projects according to benefit.  DART underground was given, in one of the less redacted papers, a benefit to cost ratio of 2:4.  Could we see an assessment of all the range of projects that come out of the medium-term capital spending review assessed in that fashion?  That would be very helpful.  If there are better ways we would welcome the Department's expertise in trying to provide a framework where we can have that kind of meaningful discussion about how we can get good value for money from projects.<\/p> <p>  I think I am covering the points.  With regard to the question of financing, it is a critical issue.  We certainly believe that there is scope to query the Stability and Growth Pact, the \"six pack\" and the various rules.  Under the latest revision of those rules this year there is an opportunity to invest in productive capital spending if it can be shown to increase the growth rate of the economy on a once-off basis; we are allowed do it once.  We believe there is a pressing need to jump start the huge capital deficit the economy faces.  That higher growth rate will in turn generate revenues.  There are any number of self-sufficient arguments made to the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>Every scheme always pays for itself in some way, but we believe if projects are properly evaluated, and the returns to the Exchequer and the economy are properly assessed, they will provide their own returns.  If the Deputy recalls, when we had the big national debt problem in the 1980s, the amount we owed did not fall.  It was still &pound;120 billion or &pound;130 million.  The economy grew and that is how our debt to GDP ratio fell.  Some consideration should be given to this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>There was a question on regional centres outside of Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I can say a little on this.  The national planning framework speaks about developing urban areas.  There is clear evidence internationally, from the European Union and the OECD, that city regions are how businesses and economies will tend to grow in future.  We absolutely support the development of other city regions.  One of the challenges that came out of the most recent spatial strategy is that it means not everywhere in Ireland can be a locus or focal point for growth.  However, we think that with proper planning, regions surrounding urban areas can also benefit if they are linked and connected and plugged into them.  This is a solution.  Deputies may not be aware that jobs are recorded by where people live.  They are not recorded by where they are and when we see growth in jobs in Kildare, it is often because of people commuting on the dual carriageway to get to the M50 to be in a traffic jam.  The growth in Dublin is actually supporting jobs outside it, in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and much further afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I believe the comments made by Mr. McGibney on the publication of cost-benefit analysis should apply to the committee.  We are supposed to be a budgetary oversight committee but I must confess we do not get this information in any detailed meaningful way.  This committee is part of new politics, but very little additional information is provided to it.  If it was in order, we should write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to request we get this information and that organisations such as Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which does a lot of work among businesses in the wider Dublin region, should also be able to obtain data.  It is essential.  As a body very involved with many employers establishing businesses broadly in the Leinster and Dublin regions, this information is absolutely vital in supporting the decision by a business to make an investment in Ireland or supporting the decision of a local firm which is expanding to continue.<\/p> <p>  Does the chamber support making Dublin city a living wage city?  One of the problems for people working in the city at present and for businesses is that the shortage of housing and the spiral in rents, traditional low-wage jobs, very often in the retail sector which is big in Dublin, mean it is not possible for people to live.  The type of contracts people get, where hours are insufficient, means that often they are not in a position to approach banks or, at times, credit unions with a view to get extra mortgages.  I know this is not the subject of today's discussion, but it is very important to have quality jobs and decent pay and conditions for people.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the projects, has the chamber had a discussion with the Government about the break and gag on capital expenditure in Ireland because of the total inflexibility of the fiscal rules?  We are a small country.  We cannot avail of the Juncker plan because it is only available to larger countries, and it is not even particularly available to countries such as France and Italy because of the debt levels.  There is a huge amount of money floating around the EU, and countries such as Ireland, which have good investment prospects in terms of public investment, cannot access it.  Would the witnesses agree the European Investment Bank and public private partnerships are, in many ways, a poor substitute for direct state investment if the deficit rules looked at capital investment separately to current investment?  There is obviously scope at different times for many styles of investment but, at present, we are strangled as a country and a city in terms of capacity for capital investment.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask specific questions about public transport in Dublin.  One of the cheapest and fastest things that can be done is the electrification of the suburban railway lines from south and north Kildare into Dublin city and their connections on to other large towns and cities.  What is the sense of the witnesses of where the Government is at on this?  For example, the Maynooth line should have been electrified a long time ago.  We could have a DART service on the Maynooth line, which would increase the carrying capacity of the carriages.  We also have on the west side of Dublin, into Kildare and west Dublin, which I represent, significant capacity for the additional building of homes in areas where people would like to buy and where we could have social housing.  Given Dublin Chamber of Commerce is such a major body in the city, has it had an opportunity to discuss this with the Government?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the comments made on buses, Dublin Bus in my view has improved its service substantially and all credit to the people who work there and provide the service.  However, it is now dangerously overcrowded because there are just not enough buses.  The development of the app by Dublin Bus and the real-time information on bus movements at many bus stops have revolutionised Dublin Bus in a positive way.  It is a tribute to the public sector that it has done this, but it does not have enough services.  When it is off peak, there are definitely not enough services.  If we really want to shift people from the car to public transport, the extension of the DART to other suburban rail services, of which there are quite a number in the Dublin area, would be a very fast win, but it would require an amount of investment.  Longer term projects such as metro north are very valuable, but today we have seen the statement by one of the leading people associated with the transport sector that it could not even start before 2022.  It would be helpful to us as a committee if Dublin Chamber of Commerce could look at the timeline with regard to the projects on the list.  I will give an example of a recent Government decision which I completely fail to understand.  There is a strategic development zone in Hansfield in west Dublin, which has capacity for 3,000 houses, provided road access is developed.  This road access is expensive but not massively so, and when the Government recently announced a small spend of &euro;200 million on access to get housing sites started, it was specifically excluded in a way that simply makes no sense to me.  Given that the committee is about budgetary oversight and spending money to get the best return and best value, I am really confused by some of the decisions, or lack of decisions, of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I will take the points the Deputy has made and I will ask Mr. McGibney to comment on some of them in more depth.

The Juncker plan has not worked for any economy, including the large economies.

Two things have to be done in tandem but reducing car access, so that the city is not car friendly in the absence of a public transport alternative, would cause chaos.  Buses are an immediate stopgap.  Metro North is predicted to go ahead in 2021 after the planning and consultation phases are complete, with an earliest possible date of 2026 or 2027 for passenger use.  We cannot wait until 2027 for a transport solution to north Dublin and the airport so buses are the only realistic alternative in the short to medium term, but for that we need changes to the quality bus corridors and the moving stock.  Increasing buses would be good value for money.  Difficult decisions have to be made on certain bus routes because the low-hanging fruit in regard to bus corridors has probably been picked and there are capacity issues on some roads.  Electrification and investment in rail services to commuter towns are part of the long-term future but we will be dependent on buses for the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The population growth in Dublin has consistently been underforecast by the CSO for 20 years.  We now use the M2 and F2 figures which use the 2011 census forecast for 2016, produced in 2013, but this was wrong by about 50,000 people.  More and more people are moving into urban areas at a faster pace, much of it internal, rather than inward, migration.  Transport and land use are the biggest modern-day crisis the city has and we need to join the two issues together in a consistent way.  If we had built everything that was proposed under Transport 21 ten years ago, it would be finished by now.  There would be a Metro North and an underground DART, as well as other services.  There would also be less of a housing problem.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government gives figures showing a potential supply of 175,000 sites in the county of Dublin.  It lists various categories, what is enabled and what not enabled, what has planning permission and water, roads, etc., but the failure to progress housing supply is lack of infrastructure, including water but also a transport system.  If we could manage to integrate the two elements to allow the extra supply to come on board it would be a great help.<\/p> <p>  The chamber does not have an ideological position on PPPs and the question of public and private finance.  We do not believe financing must be private just because we are a business body.  In fact, most bundles or packages of finance are public and private finance working together.  There is an expertise in regard to the EIB, of which we can avail.  Capital spending, as a percentage of GDP, should be up at the level of the OECD and EU average, which is upwards of 4% - twice where we are at now.  There should be a bundle of private and public finance on top of that, working together.  The most important thing in using private finance is to have a consistent approach.  In the past we have developed expertise and ramped up private finance on a range of projects and then walked back down the hill again without delivering the project.  If one uses private finance one has to use it consistently.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a timeline, it is hard to break projects down into their component parts each year and to estimate what will be spent in each year.  However, separating larger projects into bundles of smaller projects can allow little pieces to be done that can fit into the overall capital spending plan and can enable projects to be progressed more swiftly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The danger is that all of us, politicians and the witnesses, have not faced reality.  It is all very well saying we could have done this, that and the other four or five years ago but the reality is that the IMF walked into the Department of Finance and took us over.  This country was broke and we keep forgetting that.  The rebuilding of the economy and other priorities were stopped in their tracks.  Nobody would disagree with the need for more capital expenditure but we did not have any money.  We need to look at the submissions in the context of reality and to get some perspective.  In many respects, however, it is a miracle the country is where it is today, after the terrible setback we had.  We must not make the same mistakes again and we have to think outside the norm.<\/p> <p>  What is the witnesses' opinion on how we might get people living within a normal distance from the city as compared to other capitals?  If one lives in London, 20 or 30 miles is nothing yet we are talking about spending vast sums of money to build a vast public transport system from one side of St. Stephen's Green to the other side of the Liffey, when we need to build proper access in the form of roads or rail to areas 30 or 40 miles outside Dublin.  There is always going to be a need for access within the city but where people live is the problem.  I live in the direction of Killiney and if I was to come in at 8 a.m. in a car or a bus it would take anything between 40 minutes and an hour.<\/p><p>On the other hand, if I have access to a proper public transport, and I am fortunate to have that with the DART, I can get into the city from Drogheda and even Dundalk in that time.  When I go to Pearse Station at 5 p.m., the queues of people on the opposite platform travelling north to Dundalk, Drogheda or west to Maynooth are incredible.  More people are living outside the city, which is not a bad thing.  The rat race which results in people having to take on huge mortgages to buy a three-bedroom terraced house in the area represented by me and Deputy Boyd Barrett is a millstone around people's necks that they will never get rid of.  Buying a semi-detached or terraced house out our way for &euro;500,000 is a bargain.  We should discuss how we can encourage people in all walks of life to start thinking about where they live and how the statistics relating to where they live are irrelevant in the context of where they work.  That is the main problem.  We are mixing up where people live and where they work.  It is not a question of extending the DART line two or three miles outside the city at an enormous cost when bus lanes and a rail link could be provided to transport people from 20 or 30 miles away.  It would take the same time as those commuting from eight miles away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#E00800","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I refer to the Deputy's first point about the miracle that the country has survived at all.  It is not a miracle.  We had a construction, banking and public finance collapse, catastrophic as it was for the economy.  In 2009, the private sector and the real economy corrected, which meant job losses at the time.  From that date, it created jobs again and from 2010 onwards we had record year after record year of exports.  The real economy recovered, therefore, and it is on the back of the real economy that the public finances recovered.  I make that point because it is important to note that the infrastructure to support the real economy is the substance of our report and that is what we are discussing.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to where people live and where the work and how they get from A to B, distance is important.  We know from the 300,000 people working for our members that they do not want to be shipped in from commuter towns.  They do not want to spend their time even on efficient public transport.  They want to be able to live near where they work, they want a short consistent commute time and they want to be able to live in the city.  Dublin is like a doughnut city at the moment because of a failure of housing policy going back decades and multiple Administrations.  Other cities in which people enjoy a good quality of life manage to have high quality, high density living in a small nucleus within them.  For instance, people in Copenhagen have a good quality of life.  The city is not congested with cars but that did not happen overnight.  They dealt with congestion and sprawl and they said that was not the way they wanted to live their lives.  They had cross-party agreement and 30-year plans to allow for the proper development of the city.  We would like a housing policy that would encourage high density, high quality living in Dublin.  Rathmines is a village in the city, which is an example of working high density.  It is an attractive place to live.  Our experience of what we think is high density such as the towers in Ballymun was not high density at all.  They were medium rise, low density towers and they were a failure of social policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>What about high rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>We would like to see high rise, high density, high quality housing in designated areas in the city centre and not sprawled around the city.

What are her members saying to her about the impact of the shortage of housing for their employees on their businesses?  With regard to commuting times, how does Dublin compare to London?   When I lived in London, anywhere within an hour of the city was considered a good commute and I travelled for approximately one hour door to door.  That was normal.  What does Ms Burke consider to be a short commute and to be reasonable?  I very much agree with Deputy Barrett that we need to realise that people cannot live in the city centre next door to their workplace.  It is acceptable and reasonable to think that in a city that will expand that people should live further outside and commute using good public transport links.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Burke's comments on quality of life.  She said that population growth in Fingal between the 2011 and 2016 censuses outstripped that of the five Connacht counties.  As somebody who lives in Connacht, I take a different view.  The lack of investment in our region has led people to migrate to Dublin who do not want to be there.  My constituents do not want to spend two miserable hours each way in their cars travelling from Lucan to the city centre to work long hours with poor services.  They would like to live elsewhere in the country if services, including proper transportation links, were provided.  There is a balance to be struck.  I understand Ms Burke's representations come from Dublin city and surrounding areas but we have a country to look after and capital investment needs to be levelled at all areas in the country.  Part of the reason Dublin is experiencing such huge problems is we are forcing people to migrate to the city and we are not providing opportunities for them to work and live in other parts of the country.  There are no jobs in those areas and they do not have the infrastructure to attract investment.  With regard to the lack of infrastructure in the north west, Ms Burke would be shocked by the low level of investment in the region and how difficult it is to attract investment and create jobs for our people.  It is something to think about.  We are dealing with this issue as representatives of the entire country.<\/p> <p>  Issues such as the overheating of the housing market, high rents, traffic congestion and water supply shortages are the result of forcing people to live in Dublin.  The chamber wants to push them into the city centre and expects that the current infrastructure will support that or can be built on and layered up to the point where people can live on top of each other.  That is no life.  Older blocks have much larger apartments but people are expected to live in little boxes in modern apartment blocks.  It was reported earlier than 42 properties in a development in Clonskeagh sold out within one day ranging in price from &euro;400,000 to &euro;770,000.  I am sure the &euro;400,000 properties had no more than two bedrooms.  We are telling people to live in tiny accommodation, like little shoe boxes, that is not fit for family growth.  If transport links were extended to other parts of the country to allow people to live in bigger and better housing units that can accommodate families, we would do much better in assisting the Dublin area and reducing the overheating in the market.  Those are my comments as someone who lives on the other side of the country where we see the issues a little differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00500","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Unusually, when we ask businesses what are the biggest challenges facing them, housing is number one.

If we do not get growth in the economy and raise living standards, the national planning framework and how we grow the economy will be a failure.  Spending is set in the context of where the national planning framework is going to evolve.  The national spatial strategy, which tried to prioritise 22 towns and several other ancillary towns, did not work at a time when public spending was not really constrained.  We spent a lot of money.  Was it sustainable in terms of the economic activity and the lifestyles it supported?  Transport is a big issue.  We do not have the cost-benefit analysis as we discussed.  Higher density does not automatically mean height.  In many other cities, there are between three and six storeys.  It does not have to be 20 storey mega towers.  People need to live closer together.  This is a challenge for the whole of Ireland.  If there is more one-off housing, if people move out, the service costs for health, education and transport are higher than when people are clumped together in towns and cities.  Perversely, recent incentives are to get people into towns having let them build a house a couple of miles outside the town.<br\/><br\/>It is not the case that Dublin has received more capital spending than anywhere else in the country.  It is at the bottom of the list.  Edgar Morgenroth at the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced figures for spending <i>per capita<\/i>which show that for Dublin it is two thirds of the national average.  Every other region gets more capital spending than Dublin.  My only caveat is that the data goes up to 2009.  No more recent data can be prepared because the data is not produced in order to make the analysis.  We need more data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on national income accounting figures and we need more information from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  That data is getting out of date but if we had the extra data from the Department, Edgar Morgenroth and the ESRI could produce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The witness said that perversely recent incentives by Government get people to live in urban areas.

That is what we are doing.  It is almost as though we are in such a crisis now that we do not give a damn what kind of accommodation standards we have.

I have attended several of its functions and meetings with Mr. McGibney and Mr. Sharpe and others, where we have been questioned so it is nice to have the shoe on the other foot or to make some comments.<\/p> <p>  I have family connections with Dingle, which is a very successful tourist town.  Someone from there told me recently that they have an accommodation issue for people who come to work there, particularly seasonal workers.  It would be regarded as an average size town.  It is not just a Dublin issue.<\/p> <p>  We have tabled a Private Members' motion for tomorrow evening on traffic congestion in Dublin.  It is interesting to see the feedback on that.  Part of the aim of the motion is to get the heads of people in Dublin and the commuter counties around the fact that there is no silver or magic bullet.  It will be at least 2027 before the major infrastructural projects we are talking about will be in place, if we are lucky, yet the witnesses know that the answer to a question I tabled to the Minister on the cost of congestion to the city, according to the CSO, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and modelling systems, was &euro;350 million per annum.  That is estimated to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  The amount of infrastructure that could be built with &euro;2 billion per annum is substantial.  <\/p> <p>  I have not heard the phrase \"real economy\" used for a while.  I am hoping Ms Burke used it unconsciously.  I really dislike it because it implies that nobody else is doing anything economically meaningful unless they own a business that employs people and produces or manufactures something.  I would argue that teachers educate the people who populate her \"real economy\".  Doctors and nurses care for them and make them well so that they can turn up for work in her \"real economy\" and public servants keep the whole machinery of the \"real economy\" moving.  The real economy is everybody.  It is not just business and everybody played some kind of part in the recovery.<\/p><p>I am aware that business took the biggest hit in employment numbers and profits, suffered much damage and has recovered.  I am also aware that tourism, which is very much an understated asset in this country, probably proved to be the most resilient product that Dublin had to offer during that time, and withstood many pressures that came from the crash.  In spite of that we invest very little in research and development on it as a State, compared to cities elsewhere, and I would like to hear what the chamber thinks of that.<\/p><p> On high-density development, the witnesses know that there used to be double-decker or triple-decker houses in the United States.  The suburbs can offer potential for sustainable high-density development, but people have to be led.  People like Mr. Dermot Bannon, the architect, are critical in that because they are trusted figures in the public eye.  It feels like they are late to the debate because it is a matter that I had considered a long time ago as a politician, but their entry to the debate is important because people trust them.  Mr. Dermot Bannon recently repeated what the witnesses were saying, that Dublin is not just like a doughnut, but like a saucer, where the density gets higher the farther out one goes.  I think the witnesses from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce mentioned Copenhagen.  We have 25% of the density within the boundary of the M50 that Copenhagen would fit in that space.  That is good news too because it means we have much capacity there.<\/p><p> Rathmines is full of derelict bedsits too.  That is the only downside of it.  The reaction to two previous Governments trying to improve standards in bedsits was that the whole thing shut down.  I take the witnesses' point about densities, but there is much dereliction there and much unused accommodation.  Several Governments and city councils have tried to incentivise the re-use of those, and it has been really difficult to do that.<\/p><p> Major infrastructural projects are a decade away and the Minister, the Government and the NTA have told us that, without ever asking us or consulting with the public; we do not have a choice now but to accept that public transport is the only way to alleviate future traffic gridlock.  What steps do the witnesses envisage may be necessary during that decade in traffic demand management and in entry and access to the city from the commuter belt?  Some 70% of employees in Wicklow come to the city.  Some 40% of Kildare working people come to Dublin.  That will keep growing.  I imagine some serious thinking will need to be done in a proactive way, or we are going to have to react in a crisis at some stage down the road.<\/p><p> Five of the top eight tech companies are based here in the city and I met one of the lead people from one of them.  I am always fascinated that this company's major selling point is that it manages data.  It has a huge amount of expertise in the data management area.  We have a huge amount of expertise in university faculties.  The State has invested hundreds of millions of euro in this over the years, in transport, climate change and other areas.  Does anyone ever ask these bodies to get involved in designing solutions for Dublin?  Have any of the tech companies ever been approached, whether by Dublin City Council or the NTA, to see if they have something to offer with regard to providing solutions and managing data, at which these companies are experts?

One of the biggest reasons that Fingal's population is growing is that household size is increasing.  That is because kids are staying at home with mum and dad and have not moved out.  People of a certain age may want to live closer to town and all the action, then they want to move out as they develop a family.<\/p> <p>  Tech companies have got involved with some of those transport solutions to provide for themselves and have talked to us about wider demands.

It is a commercial choice for Dublin City Council and the other local authorities, because they can sell the data. <\/p> <p>  The real data problem we are facing here from a transport and land-use perspective is that we are working off the 2011 census.  The 2016 census is out but the data on where people live, where they go to work and how long it takes them will not be out until next year.  If we could progress that - if it is a matter of resources available - we should, if open data could solve that problem.  There are huge sensitivities in census data and such, but there may be a way to progress that which we should consider.<\/p><p>We need those data urgently to know where people live, where they go to work and how long it takes them to get there in order to find that solution.  It is the real and critical problem we face.  The Deputy referred to the point about the congestion cost in Dublin.  It is worth recording that this was an analysis produced by the NTA.  The last published analysis by its predecessor in 1999 indicated a congestion cost in Dublin of &pound;500 million in punts, or over &euro;1 billion in current terms.  It is quite a conservative estimate.  If it is going from &euro;350 million now to &euro;2 billion in 2030, it is still a very conservative estimate of the cost of what we call \"congestion\".  The long-run future for the evolution of any city will be more to do with public transport, better planning of transport and housing and ensuring public transport is viable by having the density to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I apologise for being outside for a few minutes.

We would have got it for half nothing in the middle of the recession and it would be opening now.  It was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that killed the project through a supplicant and unfortunate Minister with responsibility for transport, who was one of the Deputy's own colleagues.  That is who killed it at the very time we should have built it.  We would have got funding.  It was the perfect countercyclical infrastructure investment project.<\/p> <p>  I also must disagree with the Deputy who said it would be great if we all travelled long distances in.  I could not agree more with Ms Mary Rose Burke from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I was in London at the weekend.  One should look at what our competitor cities are doing.  I was near Bermondsey, an area that was empty 15 years ago but which is now packed and within walking distance of the City of London.  That is what we should be aiming for and it is what we are competing against.  Do we want to go to Bermondsey or some other area?  The Government published a website recently which sets out the massive extent of public land available to us which is close to the centre but which we are under-utilising.  That is what we need to develop.<\/p> <p>  Having made that general case, I have some further points.  I am glad Ms Burke mentioned the need for investment in cycling infrastructure, albeit it is not listed among the chamber's priority.  I would place it as the first priority in Dublin because in terms of immediate responses, we have six projects which are ready to go.  The Liffey cycle route currently has approximately 1,000 cyclists and a similar number of motorists.  If we get the same 50% increase in cycling capacity there that we did on the Grand Canal, it will be the most immediate capacity response to adopt.  That is what London, Paris and New York are doing.  It is what our competing cities are doing.  It is not just the Liffey cycle route, it is the College Green project which was announced yesterday and the Sutton-to-Sandycove project which would make a very nice cycle from D&uacute;n Laoghaire into town.  It is the Dodder greenway, the Santry greenway and the Tolka greenway.  These are projects we have been planning for decades and which are close to being ready to go but which have no funding and, I must say, not enough political support.  When the Liffey cycle route was before the council last week, we saw that there was insufficient political support.  That is a real problem.  They are not necessarily cheap.  To do the Sutton-to-Sandycove route properly would require a fair bit of funding.  Cycling is not just the tail end of spending, but should be 10% of our transport budget.  In Dublin, those are the six arterial congestion solving, capacity improving, lifestyle enhancing projects which should be the No. 1 priority ahead of all the other projects the witnesses mentioned.  Either we do them now or we give up on trying to make Dublin a safe cycling city.  Having spent 25 years trying to achieve that, the Dublin cycling campaign deserves the support of the Chamber of Commerce in relation to those projects.<\/p> <p>  I disagree fundamentally with the Chamber of Commerce on the need for an outer orbital or eastern bypass.  One cannot say on the one hand that we need to invest in public transport and then on the other hand dangle the prospect of massive new road projects.  We are already doing that with the widening of the N7 which should not be coming ahead of public transport projects.  There is no demand of any scale to justify the multi-billion cost of an eastern bypass for people to get from Stillorgan and its environs to the airport.  If we are going to build a metro to the airport, let that take them there.  There is no demand for that road.  In any of the modelling I have seen from the Dublin transportation office or elsewhere, there is no crowd of people looking to get from the southside of Dublin to Whitehall or Balbriggan or any point in between.  If there is, they should be using the DART and the metro.  We do not need an eastern bypass and even less do we need an outer orbital.  The outer orbital simply fits into the mad IBEC policy presented to us here regarding 1,500 km of motorways nationally as if climate change did not exist and as if we had learned nothing in terms of sprawl and the doughnutting of our cities which has gone on in the last 20 or 30 years.  The Chamber of Commerce has said on the one hand it wants to stop the doughnut effect but on the other it has included the outer orbital in its submissions, which is to build another ring around the doughnut.  That does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Our preference is for a smart, liveable, walkable and cycleable city and that depends on a certain public policy ethos to support such a goal with high density living to some extent in the city centre and reduced commute times.

I take Deputy Ryan's point about the orbital ring road.  It is included in our policies because if we do not get DART underground and metro north, we will have no alternative because the city will grind to a halt.  Our focus is on ensuring the city continues to be able to function as a competitive one and in that regard we have choices to make.  One is to make a full commitment to public transport on a long-term basis - and I mentioned a 20-year capital investment plan earlier - because we cannot have this stop-go, stop-go approach.  In the absence of that commitment, we will need an orbital ring-road because the M50 will be a car park.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>What about cycle routes and the other points Deputy Ryan mentioned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00600","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>We support the city advancing as a cycle city.

The same problem exists with the Liffey cycle route which we should be introducing at the same time the Luas starts to cross the river near O'Connell Bridge.  The reason we are not doing it is a lack of vision and political will.

I cannot understand why and I cannot understand how he fails to see the logic of developing the city in the way the chamber sees it.

There is a great deal to talk about in all of this but I will try to touch on a few things.<\/p><p> I welcome the emphasis on joined-up integrated planning, public transport infrastructure and the critical importance of investing.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that such matters are critical.  It is possible to provide more quality bus lanes and buses quickly, but we are going in the opposite direction by cutting orbital bus routes or by privatising them, which will amount to the same thing in many cases.  I do not know whether the chamber is speaking out about this.  There has been a pattern of slashing subsidies to public transport.  They have increased slightly in the last year, but they are well below what they were before the crash in 2008.  I do not know whether the witnesses agree with my view that if we are serious about affordable public transport, a much higher level of public subsidy needs to be provided not only for the development of public transport infrastructure but also for the affordability of public transport to make it an attractive option.  Subsidies are needed.  Our public transport subsidies are well below the rest of Europe.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> I welcome the witnesses' emphasis on the critical urgency of providing housing to accommodate the people who need it.  Investment in this city will stall if we do not have enough affordable housing.  I agree that we need to increase densities, but I do not agree that this necessarily involves massive heights on the scale alluded to by the witnesses.  Would they agree with me that we could start looking at all the derelict sites that could potentially be developed?  I can think of three such sites off the top of my head - The huge site at Apollo House, which was occupied recently, is just sitting there.  The motor tax office behind the Four Courts has been derelict for last six or seven years.  The Ormond Hotel on the quays is also derelict.  I am sure we could think of many more.  I have mentioned three examples off the top of my head.  We know there are 55,000 empty units in Dublin, which is shocking.  We do not know how many of them are under the control of NAMA.  God knows what was going on there.  The number of empty units is larger than the number of people on the housing list.  There are 44,000 people on the housing list in Dublin.  We could start by doing something about the empty units.  There is also a need to build some more units.<\/p><p> The witnesses seem to be nodding as they listen to many of my ideas.  I think there is broad agreement on many of these issues.  I am glad everybody agrees there is a need to bust through the self-defeating fiscal rules.  I take it from their presentation that the witnesses agree that this is needed.  Similarly, the state aid rules are far too restrictive.  I think the state aid rules are a major problem for our capacity to make the necessary strategic decisions about strategic industries or strategic infrastructure.  This is also of relevance to rural areas that will be affected by Brexit.  If we are going to diversify our economy to deal with things like Brexit, the State needs to be able to make strategic decisions to invest in key areas without being hampered by rules that are somewhat irrational.<\/p><p> I have a bone to pick with the witnesses regarding their emphasis on PPPs.  I do not see the rationale for such arrangements.  Could the witnesses explain what it is?  Many PPPs in the housing area collapsed in recent years.  Mr. McGibney referred to the idea that all the risk is transferred to the private sector, but that is not what happens in a PPP.  The private sector gets the gains if it goes well and we take the hit if it does not go well.  We pay and we still take the risk.  If it goes well, the private investor runs off with the profit.  This applies to PPPs in areas like toll bridges, toll roads and housing.  Deputy Barrett will be interested to know that I recently discussed the need for student accommodation with officials from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT.  They have been told by the Government that no money is available for capital investment in student accommodation.  I was shocked to hear that no money is available for such accommodation in the teeth of a massive housing crisis.  Student accommodation is part of the housing crisis.  The provision of such accommodation would take pressure off other areas of the rental market.  The IADT personnel were told that no money is available for infrastructure of this kind and that even if it were possible, it would have to be a PPP.  I do not see the rationale for that.  If student accommodation is built 100% by the institution, funded by the State, the rental revenue will come back to the college.  If it is a PPP, the rental revenue will go to somebody else and not go back into education.  If the private company goes bust, we will still end up picking up the tab.  I do not see why we support these PPPs.  They do not have a good record.  They tend to cost more.  Money is put in by the public sector and, if any gains are derived as a result, money goes out to the private sector.  Most of the companies involved in PPPs are big investors rather than the small and medium-sized businesses that the chamber mostly represents.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude by asking about the big corporates with which the chamber engages.  Do the witnesses agree that we need to start making the case that these should start paying a bit more tax?  They benefit from and need some of the infrastructure about which we are talking.  I think our educated workforce is one of the biggest reasons the American multinationals are here.  In fact, the representatives of the IADT confirmed this to me when I met them the other day.  They said the big IT firms contact them all the time looking for the IADT's graduates because they are of such a high quality.  This tells me that investment in education and in people has all sorts of positive spin-offs.  However, these companies do not want to contribute towards investment in such infrastructure.  Equally, their employees need affordable places to live, but they do not want to pay the taxes needed to fund the kind of affordable housing infrastructure that could accommodate those employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J01100","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to address some of the points he has made.  Bus routes will be sustainable if the areas they serve have sufficient population density to ensure the buses on those routes operate at capacity.  I take the point that a lot of key transport infrastructure will always need an element of subsidy.  It is quite difficult to make orbital routes, in particular, operate on a fully commercial basis.  For that reason, they will need long-term subsidies.<\/p> <p>  I agree that a large part of the solution to the housing crisis can be found by looking at derelict sites and buildings and brownfield and infill sites in the city.  New-builds are also needed as part of a multifaceted approach.<\/p> <p>  Investment in infrastructure is required as part of the solution to the challenge the country faces in the context of Brexit.  We need to be competitive in response to the various external challenges, including Brexit, we are facing as a small open economy.  That is why much of our focus is on transport infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  If the State had unlimited wealth, of course it would fund these projects from its own resources rather than through PPPs, but that is not the reality.  PPPs are part of the solution where the State needs to address critical bottlenecks in infrastructure investment.  While they are slightly more expensive than the rate at which the Government can borrow money, it is worth noting that there are constraints on how much money the State can borrow.<\/p> <p>  That brings us back to the rules.  We have long argued that the fiscal rules are absolutely appropriate when it comes to current expenditure.  We need some kind of deviation or derogation from the fiscal rules when it comes to capital investment in support of a growing population that is contrary to the European trajectory on populations in other cities.  We support the rules for current expenditure, but we would like to see much more ambition in respect of capital expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The other issue with PPPs is that in the absence of public, private or joint funding, that bit of the kit does not get built at all.<\/p><p>That is not a costless decision because it costs us in terms of the &euro;350 million, projected to &euro;2 billion in 2030, for congestion.  There are many other opportunity costs if we do not build the infrastructure in the first place.<\/p><p> When it comes to corporate taxation, we are clear that part of the offer which makes Ireland and Dublin attractive for foreign direct investment is a suite of products such as stable Government, a stable and pro-business policy environment, a good education system and a stable tax environment.  What corporates need is stability and to be able to project.  They do not want a stop-go on, say, education.  Instead, they want key infrastructure and for it to be attractive for their people to live and work here.  They also need a stable tax policy.  The totality and the talent is a large part of that.  Tax is not the only reason they come here.  It is an important part of our offering.  In light of many of the changes happening elsewhere, I would caution against policy changes which would remove that confidence in a consistent policy environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I obviously talk much about the corporate tax regime.

We are good at doing distributional analysis.  The ESRI has its SWITCH, simulating welfare and income tax changes, model.  Every time a budget comes out, it provides an analysis by decile of how many people benefit and how many lose.  There is no real framework to engage in terms of what happens if one increases or cuts taxes, however.  I would argue if one increases taxes, one gets less of an activity.  Sometimes things do not happen that one might want and one gets less revenue, perversely.  At other times, maybe one gets more revenue.  I have no framework, however, to engage on that because there is no analysis from the Department of Finance that is published that allows us to discuss this.<\/p> <p>  The biggest issue for many SMEs is not corporation tax but capital gains tax.  It is about financing.  It is not about them making the money but how somebody can invest and take a risk in their business.

We might disagree or not about policy but I do not have a framework to engage on what happens when one increases taxes on capital gains or income tax.

In certain sections, the terminology of the Bill should be revised.<br \/><br \/>2.  An enforcement mechanism should be included in the Bill. <br \/><br \/>3. Any potential drafting deficiencies in the Bill may be best addressed during the Committee Stage debate of the Bill.  The Joint Committee also believes that the Minister, with the assistance of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, could propose amendments to rectify any drafting problems by drafting a suitable amendment at either Committee or Report Stages of the Bill. <br \/><br \/>4. The scope of the Bill should be expanded to take account of other activities, such as those that use geothermal technologies, which may be used to access shale gas through other means.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment ensures that the first three recommendations are taken on board.

I also thank all of the members of the Oireachtas joint committee who compiled the pre-legislative scrutiny report that was launched last month.  I thank the Members who attended the launch and recently spoke to the media and local groups that attended.<\/p> <p>  The report, which firmly supports the need and scope of my Bill, was yet another indication that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as a whole, is committed to acting to prohibit the process of fracking from ever being allowed to occur in this country.  It joins the unique moment on a day in September 2016 whereby all parties bar none in the D&aacute;il came together to speak in support of the Bill on Second Stage.  I wish to state for the record of the committee that I have brought the Minister's amendments that were before us today to the close attention of the communities in both counties Sligo and Leitrim.  Over the past number of weeks I have analysed and discussed the amendments with groups such as Lovely Leitrim, Good Energies Alliance Ireland and others.  They have informed me this week that the amendments have been accepted on the ground and they welcome what has happened here this evening.  On that note, the speed and momentum with which this Bill has cleared pre-legislative scrutiny and Committee Stage must be highlighted.  Others outside of the House have overlooked the difficult political realities and requirements involved when writing legislation.  I wish to acknowledge, in particular, the scrutiny required when dealing with a Private Members' Bill and the politics involved in having such Bills accepted by the Government and the Department.  I acknowledge that this Bill is unique legislation that has moved very quickly through the Houses.  I acknowledge each and every person involved and thank them for their efforts.  No efforts have been made to undermine or delay the legislation.  I suspect that the Bill could not have proceeded any quicker and I ask the Minister of State to clarify this.<\/p> <p>  I am a humble backbencher from the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  For me, today is a groundbreaking moment in Irish politics.<\/p><p>I am aware that a Private Members' Bill, let alone one from a non-committee member, rarely if ever reaches Committee Stage in the legislative process.  What has happened here today proves that new politics, despite all of the negative comments the media, can work and works quite well.  This Bill's passage to Report and Final Stages is solid proof.  The Government has accepted this Bill and I presume that it will table its own amendments to improve the legislation.  I anticipate that the Bill will reach Report and Final Stages quickly and will make substantial progress by the summer recess.

I wish to raise a political matter even though I know is not the responsibility of this committee.  I would like everybody to discuss, in a joined-up manner, whether my concerns are justified or unfounded.  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is being signed by over 20 countries at the moment and we are about to sign up to it also.  We have briefly discussed CETA before.  As far as I know, CETA can allow for interference in local rules when it comes to making decisions about free trade under this agreement.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That committee discussed the matter but it was not clarified enough for me.  Perhaps the Minister of State or Deputy McLoughlin who are present will express their views on the following CETA matter.  If CETA is passed there is a possibility that a country like Canada could challenge the law on the basis that it flies in the face of the sentiments of CETA, which is not to block a production or trade agreement that is enshrined by CETA.  There are fracking companies in Canada that may wish to carry out fracking in this country but today's Bill should prevent them from doing so.  Can such companies call for an investigation, considering what is enshrined in the law, into the economic blocking of a Canadian company that wishes to conduct fracking in this country?  Can such a company refer the matter to a court of law citing the trade agreement and a court impose a heavy fine on Ireland for preventing fracking?  I did not get a satisfactory answer to my query from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Perhaps the Minister of State can address my query because I am still unclear about the matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12017050900002#C00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1494347400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I was unable to speak on Committee Stage because I was stuck in the Chamber debating Priority Questions.

It was brought to my attention in advance of the meeting that today, 9 May, is Europe Day, and discussing a project potentially linking the Irish grid to mainland Europe is quite apt.  I am joined today by Rosemary Steen, EirGrid's director of external affairs, and John Fitzgerald, EirGrid's director of grid development.<\/p> <p>  The grid strategy which we published recently, and which I hope members received a copy of in recent days, was first published in draft in 2015.  That reviewed our grid strategy and responded to feedback from the public and public representatives over recent years.  The strategy crystallises a number of core strategic pillars that our work is now based on.  These were that there will be open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities and stakeholders in our approach to network development; that all practical technology options will be considered for network development; and that the existing network will be optimised to minimise requirements for new infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Following the publication in draft, there followed an extensive period of public consultation and regional forums to garner the opinions of communities and organisations from each corner of the country.  The new strategy is very much part of our ongoing efforts to encourage more participation in our decision-making process.  It also reflects an updated economic context, and our growing experience with new technologies.  In addition to these external factors, we have also carefully considered the Government's energy White Paper, and the various economic strategy initiatives undertaken by the Government including the Action Plan for Jobs and the IDA's 2015-2019 strategy.<\/p> <p>  We are always cognisant that we must ensure that the electricity grid is available to fulfil the policy goals set by Government.  To date we have been very successful in integrating renewables into the system.  The Minister, on the radio on Friday, referenced the need to go further in terms of integrating renewables and we are working hard to deliver that policy objective.  The strategy that we have set out is based on all available information to us at this moment, and is an informed view of Ireland's needs as an economy and a society in the coming years.  However, we will continue to review it on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>  A central tenet of our new approach is continuous and ongoing assessment, discussion and debate on the needs for grid development.  For this reason, we have been progressing a new initiative called \"future energy scenarios\".  This brings together the best available data and expertise to ensure that this country's grid is best prepared for all our future electricity requirements.  We have looked carefully at similar organisations abroad which have pioneered a scenario development and planning approach.  On the back of that we have developed four possible scenarios which show how the energy system may evolve years from now and what this means for our economy and society.  This piece of work has been out for consultation for a number of months and we look forward to finalising the scenarios in the next number of weeks.  When finalised, we would welcome an opportunity to present these to the committee if that would be helpful and we would be happy to meet members individually if they wish.<\/p> <p>  Clearly one of the key challenges for EirGrid and the energy sector, along with most other sectors, is the vote of people of the UK in June last year to leave the European Union.  This has introduced new considerations, new challenges and new opportunities for us all.  At EirGrid, our case is unique as we operate the electricity grid in Ireland and Northern Ireland and also operate the all-island wholesale electricity market.  We believe that this remains one of the key tangible benefits of peace and co-operation between North and South and our view is that this should be safeguarded.  Despite the obvious uncertainty that Brexit presents to us all, there has been widespread recognition at official and political level in Brussels, London and here in Dublin that the energy sector on this island should not be negatively impacted by Brexit.  We welcome that and I emphasise my belief that retaining the single electricity market will allow this island to drive innovation in the electricity sector, particularly in terms of delivering value for customers and moving to a more sustainable energy system in the years ahead.  Retaining the single electricity market will ensure the costs of electricity are kept to a minimum for homes and businesses.  Any move from the current system would likely only serve to drive up electricity prices both here and in Northern Ireland and negatively impact competitiveness and security of supply on the whole island.  I think we can all concur that this would be a regressive step.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the proposed Celtic interconnector, and we have a number of slides which will provide some details on the project.  At the committee meeting in February, along with others from the energy sector, committee members were particularly interested in this project and we are delighted to be invited back to give more details.  We have been looking at developing a link to France since 2009, notwithstanding that the recent decision on Brexit by the UK has increased the potential strategic benefits associated with the project.  The Celtic interconnector is a proposed electrical link enabling two-way supply of electricity between Ireland and France.  We have been working with R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE, the national transmission system operator in France, since 2012 to jointly investigate the feasibility of the interconnector.  It would be approximately 600 km in length and would use established technology for subsea long-distance transfer of power.  It would be able to import and export 700 MW of electricity, enough power for 450,000 homes.  The project would undergo full public consultation should it proceed.<\/p> <p>  Our studies to date have shown that it would considerably enhance our security of supply by providing an additional source of power and by diversifying our power sources.  The interconnector would provide Ireland's only energy connection to an EU member state once the UK leaves the EU.  In addition to the key security of supply issue, we believe this project, if completed, would put downward pressure on the cost of electricity.<\/p><p>This would occur due to us securing direct access to the larger continental electricity market.  This will positively impact on the cost of electricity to Irish homes and improve competitiveness across the wider Irish economy.  In addition to these benefits, the studies we have all undertaken to date have shown that the product would bring positive benefits to Ireland in our shared efforts to meet carbon reduction targets.  While these have been shown in preliminary studies to date, we hope to be in a better position to quantify those throughout next year as the studies develop.<\/p><p> At EU level, there has been consistently strong support for the project.  In addition, last July President Hollande and An Taoiseach witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and RTE to progress the project to the next stage of assessment.  The European Union's policy is to establish an integrated European electricity system, and it has designated the Celtic interconnector what is known as a project of common interest.  As a project of common interest, the interconnector will also qualify for financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility.<\/p><p> To date, the Celtic interconnector has received &euro;3.9 million in EU funding for the project's feasibility phase and, more recently, another &euro;4 million has been approved for ongoing work.  Our studies, in conjunction with our French counterparts, have concluded that the interconnector is feasible and beneficial to Ireland and France.  Our shared estimate for the cost of the project is that it will be of the order of &euro;1 billion, depending on the cable demand and prices at the time.  I would emphasise that this cost would be shared between ourselves and the French and, as previously acknowledged, we will also look to Europe for support as this is a key project in delivering on its goal of an energy union.<\/p><p> We are currently working hard on the details of this with RTE and our respective regulators.  If we pass various milestones, we anticipate a decision to proceed with the procurement of the project towards the end of 2018.  If this were achieved, we believe the project could be commissioned in or around 2025.  This means that within nine years Ireland could have a direct connection with mainland European grid and start accruing the considerable benefits this would bring.<\/p><p>   I thank the committee for the opportunity to present and give a very brief overview of the topics.  I am happy to take any questions the Chairman or committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Slye.

I have some brief questions and will unfortunately have to leave the meeting shortly.<\/p> <p>  There have been some significant developments in the area of offshore wind in recent weeks, years and months.  Denmark, Holland and Germany are starting to see offshore wind coming in at five cent per kW hour, which is a fraction of what it was even three or four years ago due to the nature of the bidding system.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the UK Government has changed its modelling forecast for 2030.  The key aspects can be summarised as it forecasting that its PAR demand would come from an additional 12 gW of combined cycle gas, 12 gW of offshore wind and, more interestingly, 12 gW interconnection.  In that regard, it is clear is from listening to the European Commission that projects in the future might include a European co-ordinated project in the Irish Sea.  There could be 3 gW of offshore wind and the Isle of Man could be used as a converter station base.  Scotland could be connected through boot straps and Ireland and Wales could be connected.  It would be a very beneficial project in terms of developing offshore wind competitively and providing energy security for Ireland, Scotland and England.<\/p> <p>  I get no sense that EirGrid is interested in other interconnectors that should be in play.  Why would we allow the project to become a private developer project?  Why would we not continue our tradition of public ownership, including the east-west interconnector, of the transmission assets?  It would make eminent sense.  I believe we would get significant funding from the European Union for the project.  It is a project of common interest and would receive funding from Juncker.  People are dying to invest in this area and the economics are now right. <\/p> <p>  I am delighted that there will be a French interconnector, but how can we roll over the Irish Sea with ambitions?  Having shown that we can do it already, we should be the lead developer in the Irish Sea.  We know how to do it and we should deploy the expertise of the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, Mr. Slye is correct about getting the all-island electricity market right.  Given that we have an interconnector, surely one of the other issues we have to work out in the Brexit negotiations is our east-west trade.  What talks have started in that regard?  It is interesting that Commissioner Barnier will come before the Houses on Thursday.  The Commission seems to be saying that we cannot talk about anything with Britain until the Brexit bill and so on is sorted out. <\/p> <p>  Surely we must talk to National Grid and others about how the east-east interconnector will operate in a post-Brexit world.  Will we have to wait for the Commission to give approval for us to start talking about that sort of stuff?  I would be interested in hearing about the negotiations that are taking place, not just on the island network or pricing arrangements, but those pertaining to the east-west interconnector.<\/p> <p>  If I recall correctly, the last major update in terms of grid investment plans was in 2014.  In some ways, it involves a scaling back of the original grid plans.  Three scenarios were referred to in terms of future demand, that is, low, medium and high.  Can Mr. Slye give me the demand per tW hour for 2016?  Where are we in terms of the low, medium or high scenario?<\/p> <p>  From the outside, it seems that given the number of new data centres that there must be a significant increase in demand.  Is that starting to cause Mr. Slye to question some of the investment forecasts made only three or four years ago when there had not been an increase in growth for several years?  It seems to me that demand must be changing.  Is that forcing EirGrid to consider its investment projects for onshore grid investment within our grid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#C00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I welcome the EirGrid representatives.  My questions relate to renewables, the North-South interconnector and the Celtic interconnector.<\/p> <p>  The integration of offshore renewables into the system is an issue.  How does EirGrid see that developing?  Is the grid currently geared up for offshore renewables and micro-generation?  Other European countries have moved very quickly into a system whereby thousands of sources of micro-generation are supplementing larger plants.  In Ireland, we do not seem to have gotten that far yet.  Has any analysis of the replacement of coal from Moneypoint with alternative fuel been carried out?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the North-South interconnector.  There are arguments around undergrounding or overgrounding.  The connection between Belgium and Germany is just over 90 km long.  Has it been analysed in terms of the viability of the underground option?  Could that knowledge be transferred to the North-South interconnector?  It needs to be built and we need to improve the single energy market and ensure it is retained, in particular given Brexit and beyond.  It has to be a key aim of the State to ensure that we do that for the good of the North and South.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slye set out the timescale for the Celtic interconnector and said it could be in place by 2025, which is a very good development.  In terms of funding, have there been any commitments from the European Union?<\/p><p>Have discussions been held with European institutions on supplementing the funding which will be provided by France and Ireland?  Will the French and Irish contributions be 50:50 in the sense that both countries will provide the same amount?<\/p><p> On the diagram provided, it looks like the Celtic interconnector will extend into Ireland through the middle of Cork city.  My understanding is that it is more likely that the site will be between Carne and New Ross in County Wexford.  Will Mr. Slye clarify the matter?<\/p><p> Of the four scenarios provided of tomorrow&rsquo;s energy supplies, we need to move away from the slow change scenario because it belongs to the last century and involves coal, etc.  For the evolving strategies, it would be better to link the other three scenarios of steady evolution, low-carbon living and consumer action.  On the PowerPoint diagram Mr. Slye has pointed to what this would involve.  We are familiar with electric cars, renewable energy sources, solar panels, consumer action, etc.  Surely the future is those three scenarios.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#C00400","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked, although some of them have been repeated.

We are seeing, as he rightly said, some quite remarkable results from auctions in various European countries in the provision of power from such projects.  In the past six to nine months numbers have come in much more slowly than would have been expected only 12 to 18 months ago.  There are two things happening in this area.  Part of it is due to the fact that people are betting on a technology evolution with bigger and bigger turbine sizes.  The most recent in Germany involves turbine sizes of 13 to 15 MW, which are huge.  Some have other parts included such that the actual transmission connection is provided and the developer does not have to do so.  In some the bank has fully consented and will not have to take the development risk.  Notwithstanding this, offshore wind power generation is happening more and more in these countries and the auction system seems to have worked for them.<br\/><br\/>How do we see the sector developing in Ireland?  To the extent that offshore wind energy project develop, there is much interest in developing them on the shallow bank that runs right along the eastern coast of Ireland.  Various developers have looked at different sections of it over time.  Depending on where they would connect to the system, it could be quite beneficial as most of the demand on the electricity system is on the east coast, as distinct from the west coast.<br\/><br\/>As for our interest in developing interconnectors, or even going a step further with grids on the Irish Sea, we started off in 2009 when the east-west interconnector was well under way.  We saw an opportunity to go again to the United Kingdom, but that would have been a third interconnector to the United Kingdom, or to France.  The French case at the time presented more economic benefits for consumers.  Momentum has built behind it, as we are more firm about the benefits it could deliver and have progressed in our relationship with R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE.  At the same time, several developers came on the scene looking to develop interconnectors between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  To some extent, the development space was being dealt with by these developers.  At one time, there were three separate proposals to build additional connectors on top of the existing two between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Only one of them remains a viable project.  We are also talking to our European colleagues about how we can connect up disparate sets of offshore wind farms to a grid.  TenneT is developing the concept of an island, about which we are talking to it.  We are fortunate that many of the sites on the east coast are close enough to have an AC connection to the grid without the need to have large converter stations.  We have ended up where we are with a French interconnector as distinct from one to the United Kingdom because, at the time, it presented more benefits for consumers and the other space was occupied by other developers, one of which is still there.  Who should own them is a policy question, more than being one for us.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question was on Brexit and specifically the east-west electricity trade between the single electricity market, SEM, and the GB market.  I would like to differentiate between the negotiations as that word has a political context in the Article 50 space.  EirGrid and National Grid in the United Kingdom are very close.  We have two interconnectors which join our systems and regularly interact.  As we are changing the market here, we have extensive discussions with the National Grid on how the two markets will couple under the new arrangement.  With the integrated-single electricity market, I-SEM, and the market changes we are making here, we are in the process of engaging in detailed discussions with National Grid on how they will link up and how that trade will happen.  Obviously, there are conversations happening to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that it will be robust to deal with whatever the outcome may be of the Brexit negotiations in a member state or EU-sense.  We continue to work as closely as we can with National Grid, as two transmission system operators, TSOs, in two jurisdictions to ensure the trade in electricity between them will be as seamless as possible to benefit consumers as much as possible and robust to meet whatever the outcome is of the Brexit negotiations.  There are, however, no negotiations <i>per se<\/i>in the context of Article 50.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s third question was about the changing nature of demand forecasts.  We will get back with specific answers on terawatt hours in 2016.  Annually, we update our demand forecasts for the next ten years.  Only last week we published our new generation capacity statement with our forecast for demand to 2026.  We review, update and publish it on an annual basis.  The projections remain within the bounds of what we foresaw with this version of the grid development strategy.<br\/><br\/>Within tomorrow's energy scenarios which look further to 2040, obviously growth in demand is one of the key variables.  It ranges from growth in demand of 26% up to 60% across the different scenarios.  There is a significant range in the assumed growth in demand figures.  The other part is that there are assumptions where the growth in demand happens.  It could manifest itself at transmission level or in a proliferation of generation at residential and domestic level.  In our consumer action scenario we actually see the level of demand drop on the transmission system, while the gross level of demand in the economy increases because it is served by small micro residential generation systems at a domestic level.<\/p><p>The Deputy's point on the importance of demand forecast within the range is well made.  We have covered it in the scenarios.  <\/p><p> The Deputy referred to data centres.  Data centres are very significant in terms of demand growth and in our energy scenarios about 75% of the demand growth we see is driven by the assumption of the build-out of data centres.  It is the key driver.  We see increasing levels of energy efficiency mitigate some of the growth that happens as economic growth happens.  Data centres are the outlier in that and we see them contributing 75% of the demand growth across the different scenarios.  We have looked at that.  I apologise for not having to hand the number the Deputy wanted.  We will get it for him.  <\/p><p> Deputy Stanley's first question was on renewables.  I spoke a little bit about offshore wind.  We are seeing a set of auction results around Europe which would lead us to believe it is becoming a very competitive technology.  There is a need, when we look at the auction results, to make sure we are comparing apples with apples.  Some of them contain provisions that the developer is provided with the transmission connection, which can be quite expensive, or with a fully consented site.  Notwithstanding that, there is a resurgent interest in it in Europe and it is winning in some of those competitive auctions.  It will always be more expensive than on-shore wind for obvious reasons but the changing technology of much bigger turbines is coming.  The Deputy asked how the grid is prepared to accept some of it from off-shore technologies.  Off-shore wind is only one off-shore technology but it is probably the only one that is commercial.  The other, such as tidal and wave energy are much further away in terms of being commercially viable.  The answer to the question about how prepared the grid is depends on where the connection to the grid is.  If it was to develop down the east coast where there are some good sea areas for developing off-shore, we are potentially connecting into relatively strong points on the grid and also closer to where the demand is.  Depending on where it is, it might be quite beneficial for the network.  <\/p><p> The Deputy's second point on renewables was on micro-generation.  The Deputy makes the point that in some other European countries there is significantly more of it than here and that is true.  In places such as Germany there has been an explosion in roof-top solar energy.  In the south east of England there has also been a huge amount of distributed solar energy installed.  It has also come on in Spain.  In those countries such micro-generation has primarily come from roof-top solar on commercial buildings or houses driven largely by very generous subsidy regimes which in some cases the policy makers have had to pull back from.  There is significantly more of it in some European countries than there is here.  As we look out to 2030 and 2040 through our energy scenarios, we see the potential for it to become more a part of the mix.  The core part of our consumer action scenario is concerned with consumers becoming more engaged with their energy future or energy system and deploying those technologies at a local, community or household level.  We will examine that scenario to see what it means for the transmission system, security of supply and distribution network.  The scenarios enable us to work through the implications for a range of things, not least policy targets, if that is what the future looks like.    <\/p><p> The Deputy had a specific question about the replacement of coal.  Moneypoint is the only coal burning station.  The decision about what to do with Moneypoint rests with the ESB.  In three of our four scenarios we have assumed that by 2030 coal will be replaced.  In one of them, we have not.  By virtue of the fact there is one in which coal remains, we will be able to see the with-coal and without-coal effect when we look at the implications of those scenarios going forward.  In so far as it affects the rest of the energy system and the rest of the network, we have sought to take it into account.  The specifics of any investment decision to change the use of Moneypoint would be for the ESB.  <\/p><p> The Deputy's second question was on the North-South interconnector.  We would love to be able to talk about the North-South interconnector.  We have been at this committee and discussed the North-South interconnector and other projects before but it is before the High Court.  There are three judicial reviews under way and there is a hearing tomorrow in the High Court on it.  I am constrained in what I can say.  On the ALEGrO project in Germany, which the Deputy mentioned, my understanding is the applicability of it or not would come within the scope of the independent review the Minister launched today or yesterday to update the previous review on technologies and the international experience.  I expect the international review to look at the ALEGrO project and others around Europe to ascertain if there are any lessons that can be learned or applicability to the situation in Ireland.  <\/p><p> I am happy to come back and discuss the North-South interconnector at length with the committee once the judicial review proceedings are dispensed with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>It is understandable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494352800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The Deputy's final question was on the Celtic interconnector and its funding and whether there was a commitment by Europe to fund it.

Of the total money spent to date, we have applied to the Connecting Europe Facility and have received funding up to 50% which is typically the maximum it will give out.  We hope when we make an application for the full project it will be looked upon favourably and will get similar treatment.  We will only know that when we make the application which we expect to make in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked the share of the cost between Ireland and France.  To date, we and RTE have operated on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis.  After taking into account moneys received from the Connecting Europe Facility, the remaining costs have been split 50-50 between us and RTE.  As part of the investigative work we are looking at now, we are working with the regulators to set out the benefits the project will deliver in monetary terms between Ireland and France.  It will inform a decision by the regulators probably towards the end of next year on what the appropriate cost sharing between the two jurisdictions is.  There is a formal European process determining how cost-sharing between two jurisdictions pursuing a project such as this is done.  In the first instance, it is the two regulators.  We and RTE make a submission to the regulators.  We expect it will happen in the middle of next year and that they will come back with a decision towards the end of next year on the cost sharing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>In the context of Brexit, it is a very good development that it is being pursued.

I have a number of questions, some of which may have already been covered by previous speakers.  The Celtic interconnector is to be commissioned and in place by 2025.  What is the timeline for this?  What is the split between Ireland, France and the EU with regard to cost funding?  Who will pay for it and to what degree?  Will there be a two way flow?  Will we contribute to the EU and France and will France contribute to us?  Will we buy or sell energy?  I wish to understand a little more about the logistics and the balance.<\/p><p>This is an area which puts Brexit in stark relief.  We can speak about very academic matters but when we look at a map and interconnectors, the physical geography jumps out at us and is very apparent.  I am delighted to see progress on the Celtic interconnector.  Nobody can anticipate or predict the constitutional relationships across these islands in future.  I was at a conference where this was discussed.  There may be a possibility of going to or through Scotland as an alternative land bridge.  Who knows where any of these countries may be post-Brexit in the long-term constitutional landscape?  Has anything been looked at in this regard or have there been exploratory talks?<\/p><p>What are we doing to strike deals with the UK as it is with regard to existing interconnectors?  I understand there was a period of downtime on the interconnector across the Irish Sea.  How long was it out for?  What was the outage caused by?  What was the cost to restore it?  What were the implications?  Obviously we took over because the lights stayed on.  What happened while it was down?  What were the exposures?  What are the operational risks of such a project?  What energy security risks are posed?<\/p><p>We have a nod to energy mix in the chart with regard to renewable energy evolution and aspirations.  With regard to solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, tidal and biomass we are quite poor with regard to renewable component in our energy mix <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other European states.  This is something we all hope to see us drive towards.  Do the witnesses have a view on where we need to be, where we should be and where we can get you in the medium term?<\/p><p>My next question may be a little out of the box.  With regard to infrastructure, connectivity and the connections we have throughout the island, the committee has discussed at length broadband and Internet connectivity.  What, if any, potential exists for using existing power infrastructure for telecoms purposes, primarily rural broadband and broadband enablement?  If we have the kit out there perhaps there is a possibility engineering-wise to use some of it.  I am interested to hear the thoughts and comments of the witnesses on this possibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#F00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for coming and for the statement they made and the material they have produced.

Beside the graph is written that data centre connections would reach 1,950 MVA in 2030 and most of these would be based in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  There is a series of data centre applications in the pipeline, as I understand it, and under consideration.  It seems that whatever view one takes, a large data centre can account for 6% to 8% of current electrical output as things stand.  Who is actually deciding that Ireland needs extra data centres?  Who is deciding we should have 20, ten or five data centres?  Is EirGrid involved in a collaborative strategic plan with IDA Ireland?  Does IDA Ireland want more data centres?  As I understand data centres, a venture with 150 jobs, which may require a substantial investment of &euro;1 billion, and require an increase of 6% to 8% of our electricity generation.  Is this a price we want to pay for 150 jobs?  If somebody said he or she had a plan to build a shoe factory, which will chew up 8% of electricity and asked for a grant, people might say it would have huge implications for data centres.<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, nobody has actually evolved a policy on this.  I do not understand whether Ireland wants to have 20 or three extra data centres or five large data centres, but the implications for our national demand are colossal.  EirGrid is a  service organisation.  It looks at inputs coming in from elsewhere, one of which is demand by data centres for power supply.  Who decides, in terms of Ireland meeting its environmental targets for electricity consumption, the fundamental strategic decisions as EirGrid understands it?<\/p> <p>  Suppose I am a company such as Google, and I say I want to increase Irish data centres by building something massive, which will increase Irish electricity generation demand by 8%, who says to me it is not a very good idea and asks how it will be accommodated in our overall national strategy?  There does not seem to be anybody who is taking responsibility and saying this is a sustainable plan, this number of data centres is something we can accommodate if we have rapid economic growth, and if we have all of these data centres we will have a massive demand and increase for electricity.  The way I see it, nobody is stating he or she is making the decision for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The reason I mention this is I believe Ireland has natural advantages as a data centre location.  Our climate means it is cheaper to cool data centres, our geography means we are less likely to suffer an earthquake or landslide or be snowed in.  We are attractive from this point of view.  The real question is what is the attraction for us.  If we look at EirGrid and the electricity producers, this is extra market, but what is the attraction?  Do we have a plan as to how much of this market we want to locate in Ireland?  It seems the employment advantages are fairly small but the energy and sustainable energy implications are very large.  Nobody has ever been able to explain to me who is calling the shots on this.  Does IDA Ireland, the Government, EirGrid or the electricity producers have a plan or is it a case of let us see what comes in, we will try to accommodate it, we will not make any strategic decisions, and then, in the planning process, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all of the rest will just have to pick up the pieces?

In line with our own assumptions, the report states that 75% of demand growth up to 2030 and 2040 will be driven by data centres.  We work with all the data centres on where they can connect.  They pay for their connection in line with the charging process and also pay for any energy they use so they are not free riding on the system.  They are having a significant effect on projections for demand growth.  We work very closely with the IDA to look at strategic sites which would be appropriate for data centres to connect.

The Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, represents more than 16,000 members in the second level, further education, adult education and higher education sectors.  Many of our members have experienced a range of issues related to precarious and casualised employment and although the union has, through a variety of collective agreements and expert reports, secured methods to address these concerns, there remain several issues that the proposed Bill may address.<\/p> <p>  The TUI has been campaigning against precarious employment and casualised work for more than a decade.  The introduction of the Fixed Term Workers Act 2003 had the unintended consequence in the education sector of not making a teacher or lecturer permanent but part-time.  Previously in the education sector permanence had travelled hand in hand with full-time work, but this unfortunately has changed.  The TUI supports the recommendations made in the University of Limerick study and believes the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 is an important way of ending the exploitation of workers and will do so in respect of the more than 40 grades it represents.<\/p> <p>  Our permanent part-time members have experience reduced security of employment, reduced terms and conditions and reduced pay owing to their long-term experience of part-time work.  They are as a result finding it extremely difficult to earn a living.  They have been employed on rations of hours and for parts of jobs, one third of a job in many cases.  In being employed as such they are receiving significantly less pay than their colleagues employed on full-time contracts.  This has not necessarily meant that such workers have been available for the other two thirds to undertake other work, as in many instances their work has been scheduled in such a way as to make it impossible to secure any other source of income.  Therefore, in the Banded Hours Contract Bill there must be a provision on the scheduling of hours for persons employed for less than full hours.  Our members do not have one third of a life, one third of a family or one third of a mortgage.  They face the same pressures, financial and familial, as any other person.  <\/p> <p>  The problem in many employments is that there is an assumption on the part of employers that the universal human right to a standard of living adequate for one&rsquo;s health and well-being, as well as the health and well-being of one family, is secondary to flexibility.  The Banded Hours Contract Bill should address this issue.  <\/p> <p>  The TUI&rsquo;s campaign has led to some improvements by way of a process designed to allow some of our members to accumulate whole-time and permanent positions.  We have secured a collective agreement with the Department of Education and Skills for our members across the second level, further education and third level sectors, whereby, although under the law it takes four years to secure a permanent contract, members are obtaining contracts of definite duration or permanent contracts after two years.  If they secure a permanent contract of less than four hours, there is a provision in the circular working hours agreement to augment them.  There is a ratcheting-up procedure to augment their contracts.  That is set out very clearly the for second level and further education sectors.  We have had some teething difficulties in the third level sector, but we are hoping they will be addressed further in discussions.  For our colleagues in the third level sector, we have had experience of zero hour contracts, hourly paid part-time contracts, associate lecturer precarious contracts and assistant lecturers on part-time contracts of indefinite duration.  Again, these are fractions of jobs, with no security of employment.<\/p><p>The pay gained by this precarious work cannot support a living wage.  A letter circularised as result of a collective agreement gives contracts of indefinite duration after two years.  There is a provision in respect of the augmentation of hours and we hope that the initial difficulties we have had in some places will be addressed further.  Maybe that is something the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 can deal with.  Researchers employed in the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, who are highly qualified and very valuable to this economy are on very precarious contracts with little or no security of tenure, pension provision or promotional opportunities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The TUI notes that the Department of Education and Skills and Education and Training Boards Ireland deploy the 'tutor grade', an undefined grade and an excuse for poorly paying teachers.  Tutors in our membership are offered no mutuality of obligation; they have little predictability about the scheduling or number of hours they will be required to work in any given week; they have uncertainty about their income which has consequences for their capacity to access financial credit; they have difficulty in managing work and family life and generally have poorer terms and conditions than those who work full-time hours.  The effect is a zero-hour contract, where there is no ongoing confidence for the employee that work will be made available to them.  The TUI is of the view that this form of employment should be legally prohibited.<br\/><br\/>The TUI is currently engaged with the Department of Education and Skills, further to a provision of the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road Agreements, on the issue of the tutor grade and the failure of the Department to formulate a universally applied method to implement the Fixed Term Work Act 2003, for this cohort and issue contracts of indefinite duration, CID, to the grade.  While those discussions are ongoing, the <i>status quo<\/i>is the award of a year averaging contract, a commitment to supply a certain number of hours to each teacher per annum, rather than per week or month.  Such annualised CIDs of hours have been given to hundreds of our members.  The work, however, is unevenly spread throughout the year.  The union continues to insist that hours must be assigned in a manner that facilitates a regular, and living, wage.  The so called &quot;flexible&quot; manner of employment sought by employers does little to guarantee a standard of living for either our members or their families.<br\/><br\/>In many Education and Training Board, ETB training centres, former employees of F&Aacute;S, who are deemed instructors or trainers, are working zero hour contracts.  They deliver courses, train, upskill and teach on demand.  They may receive only a few hours of work per week or they may be deployed up to, and exceeding, 37 hours per week.  They find it difficult to take holidays and feel pressurised into accepting work offered, regardless of the logistics of organising their lives around such work, because they will not get paid if there is not enough work available in other weeks.  Some of these people have been working like this for several years; the TUI is aware of cases where members have been working for nine years or more on a zero-hour contract.<br\/><br\/>Our position is that all members have a basic human right to a standard of living and a wage to facilitate that standard of living.  This can only be achieved through ensuring that permanent whole-time work is an achievable short-term goal for our members.  The TUI is therefore seeking changes to legislation that would provide for the following: a right in law to a guaranteed minimum number of working hours and a legal prohibition on zero-hour contracts; a right to be paid compensation, when no work is made available; an amendment to the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 to require an employer to provide a written statement of terms and conditions of employment, including working hours, from day one of employment; the right to claim an alteration to the contract of employment in respect of working hours if over a specified reference period, their actual working hours were more than their contracted hours, as provided for in the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016; a requirement for employers to advise all part-time staff of available hours and, in the case of hours that are likely to be required on an ongoing basis, the right for employees to claim such hours in advance of the employer advertising a vacancy; a structure for ensuring that part-time hours are assigned in a manner that does not preclude workers from engaging in other work to supplement their part-time income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it this afternoon on behalf of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland which represents 18,000 second level teachers.  I also take the opportunity to welcome this Bill albeit with some hopes for amendment.<\/p> <p>  Second level teaching has suffered immeasurably over the past decade as a result of the continuing casualisation of teaching in our schools.  Short-term contracts, small hours and casual hours have meant that teachers have found it very difficult to feel the security in their employment that is necessary for them to be able to give of their very best.  A lack of continuity in the relationship between students and their teachers does not lead to optimum results for these students in their academic, emotional and social development at a crucial time in their lives.<\/p> <p>  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, has, in the past, drawn attention to the fact that Ireland has a very high level of teachers employed on part-time or fixed term contracts and to the potential damage to the education system that these atypical work patterns can cause.  It must, however, be acknowledged that some progress has been made in recent years on fixed term contracts.  This is largely thanks to the implementation of the expert group on fixed-term and part-time employment in primary and second level education in Ireland, which arose out of the Haddington Road Agreement.  Its report is colloquially known as the Ward report.  Of course, ASTI members are not benefiting from the provisions of the Ward report at the moment, but perhaps that is a matter best left to another day.<\/p> <p>  However, the issue of hundreds of teachers on part-time hours remains a blight on second level education in Ireland.  The conditions of these teachers range from those who have 15 or 16 hours per week on a permanent basis by way of a part-time CID right down to teachers who get a few this week and a few the next on an entirely casual basis.  In a recent Red C survey of teachers who commenced teaching in the past six years 27% of those teachers work on a part-time basis.<\/p> <p>  Teachers who are not on full hours, and particularly those with no certainty as to hours, are not able to establish themselves as full members of their school communities.  They do not know from one year to the next, and often from one week to the next, how many hours they will have, what they can and cannot afford to do about living arrangements, will they have to work another job to make ends meet, as many teachers do.  This is not conducive to helping new teachers to blossom into their careers as the educators of our children as they should.  In fact, this mode of precarious employment militates against the integration of these teachers, who are the best qualified than at any other time in the history of the State, fully into their school communities.<\/p> <p>  There have been some attempts, following negotiations with the Department of Education and Skills and the school management bodies to deal with increasing the hours of CID holders by way of circular letter.  However, these circulars only benefit those teachers who have already acquired CIDs and they are often more honoured in the breach than the observance.  In short, there needs to be a legislative basis for these measures in order to ensure that our young teachers &ndash; and by extension our adolescent students &ndash; can gain the full benefits.  We hope that at a later stage the Bill can be amended to include measures such as a minimum call out for part-time and casual work and some form of commitment to a minimum number of hours per week for casual workers, for example, so that they are not sitting by the phone not knowing whether they can make commitments or what they can do.  On the basis of the improvements that are in the Bill the ASTI welcomes any move to increase the hours of our many part-time teachers and therefore in principle welcomes the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmaid de Paor"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>As the mother of a son who qualified last May as a secondary teacher in University College Cork, UCC, and is teaching history, economics and business, I can agree with everything the witnesses have said, and that it is not conducive to helping new teachers blossom into their careers when they are by the phone on a Sunday night.

They are correct that some improvements have been made recently in terms of the contractual situation but more can be made.  I am glad that the TUI representatives welcome the recommendations and findings in the University of Limerick report.  When the process started a couple of years ago I was very anxious to ensure that the public sector trade unions were involved because I think there was an incorrect view that the casualisation in the work place and precarious work in general were exclusive to the private sector.  We know only too well that they have become a feature of the public sector as well over the past decade notwithstanding attempts made in successive public sector pay agreements to try to address some of the worst excesses of those practices.  For second level teachers and for those operating in the third level sector the forthcoming public sector pay talks will provide an opportunity to address some of the issues around precarious work.<\/p><p> As the witnesses correctly pointed out, some improvements have been made in some recent agreements.  There is no doubt about that and I think that is on the record.  Without exposing us to their negotiating strategy, could the witnesses identify in broad terms what they feel are the priorities for their own unions, separately?  What is the way in which they would address the issues of casualisation and how will they narrow the pay gap that has emerged over the last few years?

That is that permanent jobs would be advertised.  That was the reality up until quite a short time ago.  The introduction of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 was meant to address casualisation but had the opposite effect, whereby individual appointments were being made on a part-time basis rather than a full-time basis.  So one was employed as a second level teacher for ten hours, maybe, if he or she was lucky, and could be stuck on that until after four years, when one became entitled to a contract of indefinite duration, CID, if there were not objective grounds preventing that.<\/p> <p>  With the recent collective agreements now, a person can get a contract of indefinite duration after two years.  The reality is that many of our members are getting contracts of indefinite duration on maybe a third or half of a job, but not full hours.  There is a provision in that recent agreement arising from the Ward report and the Cush report at third level, whereby if hours become available and those hours are held for a year, then one's contract of indefinite duration can be augmented.  So if one has a contract of indefinite duration for ten hours and gets another two hours on top of that, then holds that for the year, then one will have a CID for 12 hours, but still has a long way to go to get a CID for 22 hours, to have a full contract.<\/p> <p>  In our view, if permanent jobs could be advertised from the outset, that would be one way of addressing it.  A legislative basis would be helpful for the augmentation, because what we have is a collective agreement where we feel that hours are not being added on.  We end up talking about it in an industrial relations space, but a legislative basis would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  We have some other difficulties with adult education and further education.

We have in excess of 40 grades, many of whom are on the whole-time equivalent of 37 hours per week, as are most other public servants.  Those grades are obviously finding it more difficult to hit those 37 hours.  Again, like the teaching grade and the lecturing grade, they had previously been appointed permanent, and up until the last four to five years, most of those grades had regularly been appointed permanent.<\/p> <p>  The tutor grade is slightly different.  It is deployed within education and training boards.  It is paid at the unqualified teachers' rate and is generally deployed in adult literacy at this stage.  The TUI has been campaigning for the last few years and taking a variety of cases to insist that these jobs are teaching jobs.  It has had some success with that.  Those that remain in those jobs have reached a higher bar of 37 hours per week over a 42-week year as opposed to the school year, which is a 33-week year, and it is a much more difficult prospect.  Almost the entirety of our tutor membership could be considered part-time, which is some ways an opinion rather than an assertion, as the Department of Education and Skills has not advised us as to the number of hours a whole-time equivalent would have, but they certainly have significantly fewer hours than a teacher would have and are paid at the unqualified rate.  Recent agreements with the Department of Education and Skills have seen us converting those grades into teacher grades and then applying the same provisions as for teacher grades.<\/p> <p>  We also have a resource person grade which is deployed within Youthreach settings, which was appointed on a permanent, whole-time basis until recently.  Further to an agreement with the Department of Education and Skills around 2012, which saw a proliferation of resource persons being hired into the Youthreach sector where previously teachers had been hired, we now have a proliferation of part-time resource persons which we did not have previously.  The problem that we had with the teaching grade, which we were addressing through a variety of collective agreements, then became a problem for that resource person grade on 37 hours per week.  We addressed that in the last agreement, which is called the Department of Education and Skills\/TUI May agreement 2016, which was the agreement that brought the TUI into the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Over the last number of weeks, the Department of Education and Skills has issued a direction to all education and training boards to make all of those persons and resource person contracts permanent immediately.  We will look for solutions like that for our other grades that are having problems.  As I said, we seek immediate permanence and then, as quickly as possible, a ladder towards whole-time permanence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am echoing what both Ms Dolan and Mr. Kelly have been saying.  Permanent jobs is one of the issues.  It is interesting that the notion of an objective ground for not giving somebody a CID after four years seems to be very well-known by the employers in education.  There does not seem to be a notion that there has to be an objective ground for giving a fixed-term contract in the first place.  While the Department will continually say to us that it has no reason, and there is no bar from the Department to giving somebody a permanent job once there is vacancy, I think it needs to be far sterner.  It should be giving a permanent job if there is not a reason for it to be a fixed-term contract.  I had a fixed term contract myself in 1988.  It was a dubious fixed-term contract, and probably one of the first in the country.  I am familiar with the dubious fixed-term contract.  If a teacher of Irish or mathematics is employed in a school next September, there is no way the school can say a teacher of mathematics will not be needed in ten, 12 or 15 years time, so why is that person not given a permanent job subject to normal probation?  I think that should be enforced.  Maybe we should do more on our side, but the Department should tell schools to give people jobs if they have jobs to give.  If there are issues to do with numbers dropping, that can be dealt with by way of redeployment or such like, as is normal.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime - let us not be totally optimistic and think we are going to get everything we want when we go into these talks - there could be an extensive of the Ward report.  There are many areas in which it could be extended.  There are teachers not covered at the moment, like teachers who are covering for teachers on job-sharing, for example.  There are also what one might call itinerant teachers, teachers who have had a series of jobs in different schools and have been unlucky.  They have covered for a maternity leave in one place, then a career break in another place, and teachers have come back.  We have teachers who have had 11 years of teaching in different schools and because of that, they are no further on the road to permanency.

There are areas in which we could free up more space for younger teachers coming into the system.  We have all heard the arguments in recent days about the right to continue to work after the age of 65 years, but my pet issue is that there is no step-down in teaching.  A classroom teacher does 22 hours right up to the cliff face of 65 years of age, if one wants to work to that time and then one retires.  There should be a step-down that would allow people to withdraw from teaching and take a mentoring or an administrative role in the schools for a period of time while younger teachers come on board to do their 300 hours which they require for registration with the Teaching Council.

The reason that that is the case is that she teaches a minority subject, so even though she has found work in different parts of the country, mainly filling in for maternity leaves because it is a minority subject-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Does she get paid during the holidays?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#H00600","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Is it the case that she gets paid for only the hours that she teaches?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#H00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We do not come across that type of individual very often but it is a reality that this kind of teacher exists.

I thank the members of the committee for this opportunity to address them today on this very important issue, one that is particularly close to many students' hearts.  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has campaigned on the issue of zero-hour contracts for a number of years, and we are constantly dispelling the myth that students want these precarious contracts.  From the outset, I want to state that the USI's position stands that zero-hour contracts should be fully banned.<br\/><br\/>Despite the idea that if-and-when, low hour or zero-hour contracts suit students, as has been raised at a previous meeting, that is not the case.  I would add that arguments raised in this regard are weak, and act as smoke and mirrors.  The committee must be careful not to mistake flexibility for exploitation. <br\/><br\/>To emphasise the negative effects of low and zero-hour contracts for students, let me explain the context in which students live.  Most colleges charge an annual student contribution or a registration fee which covers student services and examinations.  The maximum rate of the student contribution for the academic year 2016-17 is &euro;3,000.  It should be noted that in the period from 2007 to 2014, the student contribution fee increased by 363%, from &euro;825 to &euro;3000.  I have many thoughts on that issue but that is a matter for a different committee and for a different day.  <br\/><br\/>Rents in Ireland stabilised during 2010 but began to increase during 2013 and are now being reported to be above &euro;1,000 in Ireland, which is a level that is far beyond the capacity of students to afford.  The DIT Cost of Living 2016 survey states that a minimum of &euro;1,222 a month is needed for students living away from home.  That figure does not change much for students residing in Galway, Limerick or Cork or in any other major urban areas.<br\/><br\/>In 2010, the Eurostudent Survey received 13,530 valid responses from students in Ireland.  Just over half of all students - 53% - indicated they work during term time, 35% regularly and 18% occasionally.  This national survey found that 65% of full-time students and 82% of part-time students indicated that they worked during term break while 54% of full-time students and 63% of part-time students felt that working during the term time affected their academic performance. <br\/><br\/>This case is typical in countries such as Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal where there is moderate overlap between education and the labour market, with a very high level of youth unemployment being worst hit by the economic crisis.  The most common fields for students in Ireland to work in were services and catering in which 64% and 63% of students, respectively, work during term time.  Across Europe, a similar picture unfolds where wholesale, retail, accommodation and catering services are fields connected with student labour, especially for young students.  A total of 25% of working students under the age of  25 work in the wholesale and retail sectors, while another 15% work in accommodation and catering sectors.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is a low-pay economy with traditional low-paid sectors - retail and hospitality - falling further behind EU averages.  A full picture sees students working in areas that are typically low-paid, are at risk or already in poverty and are in a position to work more hours, with their academic performance put on the line.  This is due to the pressure to meet high costs of living where fees are &euro;3,000, rents are increasing and changes to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant sees students struggling to fund college, work for little pay and not enough hours.<br\/><br\/>As noted, students typically work in wholesale, retail, accommodation and food sectors.  Evidence shows that these sectors are not only low-paid but provide very low hours, typically between one and eight hours.  These if-and-when or zero-hour contracts lead to unpredictable working hours and unstable income, which have a very negative impact on students' financial security.  Students are paying up to &euro;1,222 a month to live while also studying at college in Dublin.  A precarious employment with if-and-when or a zero-hour contract could see students unable to buy food, pay rent, afford public transport or pay bills.  Growth in precarious employment in the labour market with internships, temporary work, part-time work, zero-hour and if-and-when contracts has a negative effect on students.<br\/><br\/>The USI supports the statement of the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, that &quot;young people have an opportunity to enter well-paid and secure employment elongated and frustrated by temporary jobs on a low wage&quot;.  Today, the number of students who continue working fewer hours than they need is increasing and the only employment for them, too often, are zero-hours contracts.  Exploitative zero-hours contracts are leaving students concerned about whether they will have enough work and finance to be able to afford to continue to stay on at third-level.  Zero-hour contracts leave students finding it impossible to access loans or credit as they do not have stable, secure income or guaranteed hours.  This sort of job insecurity is placing an unnecessary strain on students. Students and young people deserve to have the opportunity to work enough hours to be able to afford a decent standard of living.  Our students with the financial burden of having the second highest fees in Europe would benefit from knowing what set hours a week they would be working.<br\/><br\/>Employer organisations argue that if-and-when contracts and low hours suit employees and especially suit students and women with caring responsibilities.  I would add that employers argue that they even have difficulty finding employees who want to work more hours.  A number of employer organisations also argue that providing any work to people reduces the cost to the State of paying unemployment benefit.  The USI argues that students who are contracted to work low hours and are on if-and-when contracts feel insecure and powerless at work.  To think someone would not want predictability and security every week is an incredibly dangerous misconception.  Laws that enshrine certainty for workers will not negatively impact business.<br\/><br\/>The <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">USI's National Student Housing Survey <\/font>showed the financial strain students face with accommodation.  The majority of students stated that their average income is between &euro;251 and &euro;500 a month and this is what the majority of respondents pay for their accommodation.  Some 20% were earning between &euro;1 to &euro;250 a month in income.  This means that income is spent on accommodation right away leaving very little for bills, food, travel or other materials. <br\/><br\/>Students need to know their hours.  This would help students plan their studies accordingly and give a more balanced work-study life.  The USI welcomes the comments made from Ms Patricia King to the effect that at the end of the day, a worker is a worker and no difference should be made between a student and a non-student worker.  <br\/><br\/>We believe that the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 seeks to balance the needs of employers with the needs of workers, giving more predictability as to when and where they are required to work.  We welcome the Bill and believe it is a step in right direction in ensuring that those who are studying can have a sense of security and not be exploited while studying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Annie Hoey"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hoey for her presentation.

I was struck by what she said about it being an incredibly dangerous misconception to think that students do not need to know what to expect in their working lives, and I would like to fully back that up.<\/p><p>Young people not just here but across the globe are being taken for granted in a major way these days because the idea is put about that they do not need to know how to live because they are hippies or precarious and other nonsense.  In fact, we saw in the French elections and the recent elections in Austria that young people under 25 are very much the disaffected, the minority and those with the highest unemployment levels.<\/p><p> On the basis that students need to know the hours for which they are contracted, can Ms Hoey tell me whether the USI has come across students who are employed and suffer punishment from employers where they have challenged the hours they were given or not given?  In other words, this is where they have stuck up for themselves and asserted that it is not possible to work on an if-and-when basis or to live on the resulting pay.  This is where they have asked for better hours or set hours or more of an idea of when they are working.  Is that challenge or request used to punish them?  In other words \"Shut up or you will get no hours at all\".  I have certainly come across that anecdotally.  Ms Hoey did not refer to bogus self-employment contracts with companies like Deliveroo.  Instead of being a worker, the person is considered to be self-employed when in fact he or she is very reliant on apps and hours dropping into his or her lap as somebody who is supposed to look like he or she is well able to look after his or her own employment.  Does USI come across that much?<\/p><p> We had witnesses in to speak on the Bill from ISME and small and medium business in the retail and hospitality sectors.  One after another, they indicated to us that the zero-hour contract does not really exist.  There was a huge level of denial of its existence on the one hand while on the other hand they said that if the Bill was enacted, it would be a disaster for the hotel and retail industries.  We were told it would be particularly disastrous in the era of Brexit, which I believe is being used as a stick with which to beat everybody in the current climate.  We are told not to dare to open our mouths about anything because Brexit is going to come down and batter us over the head.  Has the USI come across that attitude among employers?  They deny these contracts exist, but they do not want to give an inch when it comes to people asking for their rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#J00600","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>On the topic of punishing students, it would be quite hard to find a student around the country who does not feel he or she has experienced at least some level of punishment.  When I was working, I gave a bit of guff and mysteriously and suddenly found myself scheduled for one hour a week in the middle of a Wednesday for no apparent reason.  I did not know why that had happened.  One will find that when students up and down the country raise issues or even just ask for flexibility during exam week, they have problems.  That is not to paint all employers with the same brush, which would not be accurate.  However, when this flexibility is allowed, it is quite easy to find students who are very vulnerable and who absolutely need these hours in order to avoid having to drop out of college and who feel they are suddenly being punished when their hours are mysteriously cut with no explanation.  Students up and down the country have talked to us about how their hours were cut to an hour a week where they simply asked a question or challenged the <i>status quo<\/i>.  They then did not know if the hours were going to go back up the following week and as such could not go to look for additional work elsewhere to top up their hours.<br\/><br\/>It is not just students.  People who are vulnerable in the retail and hospitality sectors can find these things happening very easily.  The people who do this give good and decent employers a really bad name.  Other employers should probably stand up to them and point out that they are being given a bad name and that they do not treat their staff that way.  They should point out that this behaviour reflects badly on those of them who are good employers.  If employers are saying that zero-hour contracts do not exist, I do not see why there is a problem welcoming the Bill to prevent them.  I do not mean that in a cheeky way.  I mean it in a genuine way.  If they do not exist, they should welcome a Bill that will provide a guarantee to their employees of a minimum time to work.

Students need approximately eight to 20 hours a week just to get by.  We outlined how much it costs a student per month to survive but their incomes are not matching up with that.

By way of background, I note that TASC, of which I am the director, is an independent think tank carrying out research and policy analysis.  Dr. Alicja Bobek and I produced a report last year, <i>Enforced Flexibility? Working in Ireland Today<\/i>, which included a study of the hospitality sector.  My statement bears almost entirely on that sector because that is where we claim to have some knowledge.  I will be addressing the questions put by the committee.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The first issue I was asked to address involves the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work.  We keep talking in this context of zero-hour contracts, but strictly speaking there is no such thing in Ireland in the common-sense use of the term.  Under a zero-hour contract as understood in the UK, one is offered work and one takes it but if one is not offered work one does not take it and does not get any pay.  However, the employee pledges himself or herself to take the work.  That is illegal in Ireland under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 which obliges the employer to provide some compensation to employees who are required to be available for work but then not actually utilised.  Our research indicates that this is widely ignored because of the widespread use of if-and-when and hybrid contracts.<br\/><br\/>When employers impose flexibility on employees in this way it generates two sets of problems.  The first is that since hours and earnings are both variable and unpredictable, employees have difficulty in making savings, applying for mortgages and financial products and in organising childcare and social life.  Normal short-term financial planning is difficult since it is difficult simply to know how much money is available for food, rent and that sort of thing.  This precarious employment also makes longer term planning difficult, including for example around parenthood.  This is something we really need to get our heads around.  People are literally delaying having children because they cannot predict their futures.  Although we have not focused on this immediately, we gather that variable hours can also create problems for part-time workers in their applications for jobseeker's allowance.<br\/><br\/>The second set of problems has already come up today and it is that employers can use the offer of hours as a form of control, in particular in relation to employees' working time itself.  If the employer wishes the employee to work at hours which the employee finds inconvenient, the employee can refuse those hours in theory.  In practice, however, this will result in the employee being offered fewer hours next week or next month.  We must be clear in this regard that people often talk about this as a punishment or a threat.  In fact, it is more insidious than that.  People know that they have to be available and to accept the hours offered in order to get into a position where they have better hours.  Our respondents talk about getting better hours and working their way towards that.  Obviously, many part-time workers work regular hours and therefore do not encounter these problems.<\/p><p>Equally, many workers work part time by choice.  However, many are clearly identified as involuntary part-time workers.  According to EUROSTAT, in Ireland in 2016, 31.5% of all those employed part time were involuntary.  Our interviews with workers in the hospitality sector indicate that most want to find part-time work but, crucially, with regular and predictable hours.  Many, however, do not receive them.<\/p><p> Zero-hour contracts are banned in Ireland and should remain so.  The proposed Bill would make it more difficult for employers to misuse if-and-when contracts to impose variability on employees.  The existing regulation under the 1997 Act would then become a useful minimum standard for variable working hours.<\/p><p> There is a discussion about the administrative burden the Bill would impose on small business.  The Bill does not appear to impose an additional burden on employers regarding employees&rsquo; claims of being moved to a specific band.  Employees are required to receive pay slips reflecting the hours they have worked.  Under the Bill the obligation would be on the employee to produce that documentation which they should retain.  Section 3 would impose an obligation on the employer to display available hours.  The employer already has that information and it should not be difficult to make it available.  The ban on zero-hour contracts is crucial because contracts which grant employers control over employees&rsquo; time without remuneration cannot be justified on ethical grounds.<\/p><p> The Low Pay Commission is primarily responsible for determining the appropriate level of the national minimum wage.  A single statutory hourly minimum wage has the enormous advantage of simplicity.  Everyone knows what it is and that it should be enforced.  Research shows that the introduction of the national minimum wage in 1990 contributed to putting a floor under income distribution.  In determining the national minimum wage the Low Pay Commission has to take cognisance of matters such as the level of actual earnings in the economy.  Earnings are determined not only by the hourly rate but also by the number of hours worked and the variability of these hours.  Accordingly, the extent of low-paid hours and variable contracts is important.

The number of people with dual nationality is almost 105,000.  Being a migrant has a pervasive impact on a person's labour market participation and follows him or her through his or her labour market trajectory.  It does not stop when a person acquires long-term residency status or Irish citizenship.<\/p> <p>  The migrant worker epitomises the flexible and precarious work available in the contemporary labour market.  That precariousness is constructed around several factors, the main one being the rights and entitlements afforded to a migrant worker based on his or her immigration status.  Depending on the type of residency or visa given, a person will be allocated a certain number of hours he or she can work, going from part-time to full-time work.  It also determines the mobility a person has in the labour market, meaning that he or she might be attached to one specific employer or sector.  Immigration status is coupled with a person's lack of labour market mobility.  That mobility might be constructed by his or her immigration status but also by the lack of recognition of skills.  Migrant workers are also over-represented in low-pay sectors of the economy, in which mobility is much harder, particularly vertical mobility.  There is discriminatory practice on entry, recruitment and promotion.  All of this paints a dark picture for migrant workers in the labour market, meaning that they often lack security in the number of hours allocated to them.<\/p> <p>  Security of hours would be guaranteed by the proposed Bill.  Many migrant workers are in what are traditionally considered to be shift work sectors such as food and accommodation, cleaning and care work and many work through agencies.  Notice of their rosters is only required 24 hours in advance.  The Bill is proposing notice of one week, yet that would be limited in affording migrant workers security to plan their income and the structure of their working week.  Issues relating to child care were mentioned.  It goes beyond simply caring for children into family formation.  What is more important and necessary for migrant families and households is that security of income also have an impact on whether a person is able to reunify with his or her family.  A person's family might not be in the State and he or she might need certain hours and a guarantee of a certain income to be reunified with his or her family.  Other than that, they share the same problems of having a secure income which will allow them to access a mortgage, own property and so forth.  That lack of security means that their need for housing, for example, is more precarious than that of the indigenous population.<\/p> <p>  The Bill proposes that a display notice with a roster be put up.  Obviously, that would be a positive development.  How would this apply to agency or multi-sited workers who might not be working in the same place or given that the place to which they are contracted might not be the place where the employment takes place?  There is little explanation of how this right would be enforced.  As we have seen from our work, the main issue for migrant workers is not their lack of knowledge of their rights but the lack of a possibility for them to enforce their rights.  This goes back to the points made about the repercussions of asserting one's rights.<\/p><p>Those repercussions can be very hard for people whose immigration status is dependent on their employment or their day-to-day earnings are dependent on having one employment.  <\/p><p>On income adequacy, poverty rates among migrant households are much higher than the overall figures for the indigenous population.  From data we collect in our drop-in centre, in a sample of 740 people surveyed last year, 52.8% were earning less than &euro;910 a month, which is the at risk of poverty rate.  The majority of our client base is living at risk of poverty.  That poverty is constructed on the insecurity of their immigration status but also the insecurity of working in low-paid, hyper-flexible types of employment, including not knowing how many hours one is going to have.  My colleague Ms Edel McGinley will talk more about compliance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Research we carried out in 2015 on work and low pay highlighted that people knew their rights but they could not claim them.  It goes back to the fear of repercussions on the worker asking for, say, holidays or break times, and the implications of that.  This year's WRC report showed that there was an overall 38% rate of non-compliance in the labour market, namely exploitation.  Industries with high levels of non-compliance are food and drinks at 48%, hotel and retail is 45%, domestic work is 23% - there is a caveat with that figure as there were only 11 inspections - agriculture is 47% and hotel is 35%.  They found no exploitation in fisheries which is not our experience at all, it is absolutely widespread.<\/p> <p>  We believe banded-hour contracts really give protections to workers and particularly to workers in non-unionised sectors.  It allows them to advocate for themselves, it gives power back to the worker and that is really important because there are many individual workplaces where there are low or no contracts in place.  Among the people we work with, it is a common scenario for people to have no contracts at all.   <\/p> <p>  We very much welcome the Bill.  We welcome the six-month look-back period.  We are particularly concerned about the Government announcement this week of a new 18-month look-back period and feel it is too far.  It is very much open to abuse.  We support the tight areas of banded hours, the five hours.  We would say for the sake of clarity and to avoid confusion that we need to be sure where the band starts and ends.  At the moment it is 15 to 20 hours and it really should be 16 to 20 and 21 to 25 hours.  Those areas are also relevant.  <\/p> <p>  We are concerned with enforcement.  This is a huge problem in the State in terms of exploitation and enforcement.  It does not matter if there is a notice on a wall if nobody is going to know about it and it is not something that anyone is going to overly complain about.  How legislation is enforced is key as are the resources necessary to do that.  The members have our submission on that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we see a real need to strengthe anti-victimisation provisions in legislation because of what all the people here have said about people being victimised when they ask for their rights and try and assert them and that this is without having to go to the courts and the WRC to vindicate them.  It is important that there are strong penalties in place when people breach legislation and that is not there at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Ms McGinley's comment on the 18 month period rather than six months is interesting.

I will begin by addressing my questions to USI.  I thank it for supporting the Bill.  I am happy with the first paragraph of its submission.  Previous witnesses have come here and said that it would be very difficult for students if we put this in and USI says quite clearly that it is constantly dispelling the myth that students want these precarious contracts.  It is very useful that it has said that.  I also commend USI for its stance that student workers are workers.  It is very important that is said here today and I agree with that.<\/p> <p>  Many students work under unfair and precarious conditions as they are worried about asserting their employment rights with their boss for fear of losing their jobs.  If this legislation is passed, it would provide students with more rights but these will be of no use if student workers do not assert them.  In USI's opinion, what can be done to encourage students to make use of their employment rights to allow them to work in fair conditions?<\/p> <p>  The issue of students not getting notice of working hours in advance is another issue which the Bill aims to address.  As USI has noted, this issue results in students not being able to organise personal study plans, as a result of not knowing their work hours often right up to the day before.  Does USI think the Bill will successfully address this issue that affects many students?<\/p> <p>  I was very moved by the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland contribution, particularly in light of the programme broadcast on RTE last night about Irish migrants in America.  We have about 50,000 over there.  In this country, we have between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented and it is something we ourselves need to look at and legislate for.  It is very important that MRCI said that.  <\/p> <p>  In its submission, MRCI said that non-compliance with employment legislation by employers is a key focus of its work.  If this is the case, more employment legislation will fail to address the issues for these workers already because if the employer does not adhere to current legal requirements they are unlikely to start doing it now.  In MRCI's opinion, what can be done to ensure greater compliance by employers with employment legislation?  <\/p> <p>  I thank TASC for its presentation.  Many previous witnesses said the Bill would place additional burdens on small employers.  I am delighted that TASC has said clearly that \"this Bill does not appear to impose any additional burden on employers in relation to employees claims for being moved to a specific band\".  This is in contrast with what we have heard from employer organisations.  Would TASC agree that if employer organisations adhered to existing requirements, such as providing a payslip reflecting workers hours, that no major additional burden would be imposed?  It will be those employers who currently fail in the requirements that would be most affected as they will now be under renewed obligation to follow prescribed standards.  <\/p> <p>  From TASC's research, has it identified the practice of some employers using the offer of hours as a form of control over an employee to be widespread?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#M00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>On the administrative burden, there are things that employers are meant to do.  They are meant to give people payslips.<\/p><p>I almost give up.  Is it seriously a problem to give somebody a payslip?  They are meant to do that anyway.  Maybe the issue is that, as we know, at the bottom end of the labour market there are many situations where the payslip does not reflect the hours worked and we document that in our research.  The payslip says a person has worked N hours when actually the person has worked N plus three or four hours.  It happens, for example, in hotels and bars, that people are paid for the hours the place is open although they stay on and clean up afterwards.  Magically, however, they do not get paid for that and it is not in their payslips, which means the actual rate of pay is lower than the legal rate.  Information about hours is similar.  Presumably employers know how many hours people are working and should plan at least for the week ahead.  We all know that, especially in the hospitality industry, there is a lot of fluctuation but employers should know the sort of fluctuation there will be.  I completely fail to see what the problem is except that employers are either acting illegally, and it is not the case that every employer does, but we know that happens, or, and this is perhaps more serious, employers are bad managers.  It is always easier to summon somebody in and have them at your beck and call than to plan the work although that would probably deliver a better service.<\/p><p> I am sorry that is a bit of rant but it is important.

One is from Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT and earns &euro;10 an hour.  The student is on a zero-hour contract making it impossible to budget or plan, because at most the shift is given a week in advance so while a zero-hours contract seems great in terms of flexibility with the college schedule it makes it difficult to spend money on anything other than the bare essentials of food, bus fare and medication without worrying that the money will be needed later.  A low wage with no stability in terms of hours creates unnecessary stress but the student knows that having no contract means kicking up a fuss, leaving them powerless.  The student can never challenge the manager if they feel they are unfairly treated as they are easily replaced.  The person is paid twice a month and has had paychecks weeks or months late but is afraid to kick up too much of a fuss in case that is the last cheque.  Another student who works in a bookshop says low wages are not the main problem but low hour contracts and schedules that change week to week are.  There is no security or room for planning simple things like doctors' appointments.<br\/><br\/>We find students either do not know their employment rights or are too afraid to speak up when they do know them.  We do a lot of work with various trade unions to try to inform students of their rights.  We do a blitz of all the colleges in September but we cannot reach everyone and we firmly believe it should be an enacted legislative requirement that an employer who does not inform their employees of their rights is chased up.  There are too many people up and down the country who do not have a clue that it is outrageous, that their employer is breaking the law, and that if they are not being paid for extra hours it is wrong.  Those who do know are too afraid to speak up because of the &quot;if and when contracts&quot;.  On the point about punishment and reward, the hours of people who stick to the <i>status quo<\/i>and do not kick up any fuss mysteriously go up while another person is back down to an hour a week.  It is a very sickening environment to work in and incredibly stressful.<br\/><br\/>Students constantly come to us saying they know it is wrong but they cannot do anything about it.  There is a lot of legislation in place but students are not in a position to go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in order to take someone on.  This is very hard for non-unionised workers but it is also very hard to unionise students, despite my best efforts.  Trying to get them into unions is like pulling teeth but there are many sectors that are not unionised.  If the employers are not providing that information there is no way for the students to find that out.  It requires word of mouth and someone telling them this is wrong.  We find students stay schtum because if they do not they will be punished and someone else will be rewarded for the good work.<br\/><br\/>The notice of working hours would help students.  We are not asking for an absolutely guaranteed full-blown contract at an outrageous wage but for a guarantee of a minimum number of hours so that people can at least plan.  It is very hard to lead a life when one does not know what is happening and finds out on a Sunday that this is how it will be.  We believe with the banded hours contract people will at least be able to work out where they will be in six months time.  That is not even security but a basic minimum, like the living wage.  It will give employees a minimum to be at least able to figure out where they will be for the next couple of weeks and make doctors&rsquo; appointments and do all the basic things that people need to be able to do to lead a decent life.  The banded hours will at least give a small sense of stability for the workers on all these precarious &quot;if and when&quot; contracts in these industries.

We support them too, but we have never taken a case all the way to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Even if students are willing to push it that far, they do not have the finances or the time they need.  They are a liminal group and leave after two or three years.  The attitude is to grin and bear it, but, as a country, we should not facilitate that approach.  When I worked in a local union, I pushed students to take these things further, but we can push them only so far because they are focused on their examinations and going to Australia or wherever it is they are going.  It is very hard for them to move beyond coming to us and we are loath to push them if they do not want to take a case, nor can we do so on their behalf.  It is frustrating for students' union officers around the country when a student has a very clear case of unfair dismissal or treatment and is not willing to take it further.

We did research in 2015.  I do not have it with me but I can forward it to the committee.  There is very little research on exploitation and non-compliance in general.  From our experience in urban versus rural situations, exploitation tends to be hidden anyway.  Just because it is a rural situation does not mean that it is not also an urban situation.  Exploitation is often hidden.<\/p> <p>  On flexibility, rostering and flexibility should not be confused with security.  A roster is a roster that one is on for a certain amount of days.  What we are talking about is creating security for people such that they have a guaranteed set of hours.  If one's contract says ten hours but that person is actually working 20, it does not make sense if one is working 20 hours over an eight-month period that one is not then given the correct contract to reflect that.  It is not about trying to be inflexible for both the employee and employer.  Rostering is a challenge in itself because it is complex, as I am sure the committee would know.  It is not about trying to curtail a rostering scenario, but it is trying to guarantee security to people and to reflect what is happening in the market.  If the work is there and people are getting the hours, it seems nonsensical that they would not be put on proper terms and conditions of employment.  We have good employment legislation in the country, and I agree that we have good employers.  I am not painting every employer in a bad light, but we have non-compliance and that needs to be stated strongly because it needs to be tackled.<\/p> <p>  Cleaning is a huge area where one-hour contracts are seen.  Cleaners go into people's homes.  That often happens in both rural areas and in urban areas.

We cannot discuss flexibility outside of the context of low pay, which is the reality for the majority of people who are working in the sector that we are discussing.  On people being allowed to accept or refuse hours or changes in schedule, many people we work with simply cannot refuse a shift, even if such a person has given a phone call in the morning and has plans with his or her family.  The reason is that many of these families are single-income families.  The people with an income are generally on the minimum wage or just around it.  Being able to plan their expenditure requires that they maximise the amount of hours they work.  One needs to work 25 hours on the minimum wage to not be at risk of poverty in Ireland.  We are talking about many ten-hour or 20-hour contracts here.  These types of job do not guarantee that a single person will not experience poverty.<\/p> <p>  Among migrants, what we often see is one-earner families, because of our immigration regimes and so on.  People are not given the opportunity to refuse hours at any stage.  I do not think compliance is as simple as having good and bad employers.  I think employers can be good to certain employees and bad to others.  The reason they are good to certain employees, as Deputy Neville discussed, is because someone else is probably taking the stick.  This is generally what we experience much of.  Particularly in my research in the care industry, we see that those who are not afforded flexibility or who are given poor treatment are generally migrant workers, at the expense of other workers.  It is not necessarily linked to nationality, but it is about how close a person is to the management and so on, and nationality often plays a role in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the three groups for their presentations.<\/p> <p>  I have two short questions, but the witnesses from TASC will be relieved that I have none for them.

I noticed that the hospitality industry in particular is highlighted.  We have quite rightly heard about the impact of this on people's lives, but what is the overall macro-economic impact of having whole industries that depend on this enforced flexibility, where from one week to the next workers do not know how many hours of work they are going to get?  Perhaps Professor Wickham could comment on that.  It could have quite a detrimental impact, because if I do not know how much money I will get next week I am unlikely to purchase the item that I wanted to buy for my kid, or I might not be able to plan a bigger purchase for my family because I do not have that security looking forward.

Undoubtedly if people have unpredictable incomes they are not going to make long-term financial decisions.  We know that.  I have already said that they cannot plan, which is important for economists because it deals with the labour force, having children and setting up families and such like.<\/p> <p>  There is a much more immediate macro-economic issue which is often totally ignored here, which is the sort of labour force that exists.  If there is an industry that depends on a high turnover of people, on people who are employed and let go or employed very variably, it means immediately that there will be very little training.  The level of skill in the workforce is probably going to decline.  That means in turn that the industry is going to be increasingly relying for success on wage competition rather than quality.  We can see that in sections of the hospitality industry.  We have been able to find firms who made sure that they did retain their employees, did offer regular hours, and they were rapidly competing in terms of the quality of the service, food and hospitality they were able to give.  <\/p> <p>  There is another industry where this slide to the bottom is now well documented, and that is the construction industry.  The construction workforce - we have done work on this and written about it - has not only been decimated in terms of numbers but has been casualised in rather different ways than what we have been talking about here.  One of the consequences of that is that there has been no training in construction.  We have a skill shortage again in construction.  That also means that Irish firms do not have the skills base to compete domestically or internationally.  If an industry is organised with a race to the bottom in terms of quality it ends up competing purely on wages.

This particularly applies to students, where there is a real misunderstanding of what it is like to be a student.  Fees have gone up 383%, which is astronomical.  If that happened in any other sector the place would be going bananas.  The increases that students are facing, the fact that they are working so many more hours, the mental health difficulties that they are facing and the number of suicides we hear about show that it is not easy being a student.

This applies to students and other workers as well, but particularly to students as they tend to work for nine to 12 months and go somewhere else for the remaining months of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017050900002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Annie Hoey"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms Hoey that there is a correlation there between the amount of work a student has to do and level of success at exams.

My own daughter is studying in Limerick at the moment and many of the students there work part-time while studying.

They are in college from September until December and then they might work at home for a month, so the service will be broken.
