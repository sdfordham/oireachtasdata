Dublin Chamber of Commerce is the voice of business in the Dublin region.  It represents 1,300 members who employ over 300,000 people across the greater Dublin area.  Our membership is made up of a cross-sectoral base spanning the spectrum from start-ups through to multinationals, so we have a good insight into the infrastructure needs of both businesses and their employees over the coming decades.<\/p> <p>  Ireland faces an urban future and we believe the Government must plan for this through proper planning and infrastructural investment.  Urbanisation is an overwhelming international global trend and the UN estimates that Ireland's population will be 75% urban by 2050.  Rather than fighting this the Government should focus on getting urbanisation right, to optimise both social and economic outcomes.  The greater Dublin area is currently home to 40% of the population and it is the engine of the Irish economy, accounting for 53% of GDP.  It generates 62% of tax revenue in Ireland.  For the foreseeable future it will remain the main demographic, economic and cultural hub in the country.  In this urban future Ireland's success will depend on the strength of Dublin.  The growth of the capital city should be intelligently supported, not frustrated.<\/p> <p>  Large infrastructural investments in the greater Dublin area are not just for Dublin.  They have a national impact.  For example, Dublin Airport is not just for Dublin.  It is the national airport and eight out of ten air passengers to Ireland come through Dublin Airport.  Enhancements to the connectivity of Dublin Airport to the city and the rest of the country have benefits for both the greater Dublin area and the country.  The capital investment into Metro North as a key element of that connectivity is, therefore, a priority for Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  Likewise, the DART underground is to be seen as national infrastructure.  While it would connect the two main rail stations it also provides connectivity for Dundalk to Tralee or Sligo to Rosslare, so while Dublin based infrastructure is important for connectivity in the greater Dublin area it has a national impact as well.<\/p> <p>  We ask the Government to allocate resources in a way that respects and reflects where Irish people choose to live in their greatest numbers.  A first step in this regard would be to allow a proper debate on capital investment choices, informed by clear and up-to-date data on relative costs and benefits for the proposed projects.  This information is not publicly available at present.  What is in the public domain is out of date, so we ask for that data to be made available so we can properly inform and comment on it.  Under-investment in Ireland's biggest population hub has negative economic and social effects.  None of these decisions is cost-less.  For example, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in a response to a parliamentary question estimates an annual cost to the Irish economy of &euro;350 million caused by congestion in the greater Dublin area.  This is projected to cost the Irish economy approximately &euro;2 billion by 2030 if serious investment in infrastructure does not take place.  The European Commission has recognised that urban Ireland suffers particularly from shortcomings in infrastructure and that this will be aggravated by rising activity and population growth.  The under-investment in infrastructure is costing us on a number of indices, and the World Economic Forum has highlighted the lack of infrastructure as a bigger risk to Ireland's economy than the level of the country's debt.<\/p> <p>  We believe Ireland must have a new approach to capital expenditure.  In the past we have both under-estimated future infrastructure needs and failed to provide for them.  Dublin is now ranked as the seventh most congested city in Europe, with public transport usage by commuters at only 21.5%.  However, we have seen that where successful infrastructure is built people engage with it.  Connecting the centre of the population with the infrastructure means that people will engage with it.  We need to move the dial on that 21.5% of commuters on public transport.  Our current approach to infrastructure and capital planning is not working.  We have one of the most unstable capital expenditure patterns in western Europe and the lowest proportional capital spend in the EU.  We ask the Government to embrace long-term planning for infrastructure investment.  We should adopt a 20-year capital investment plan that is aligned to other national strategies and supported with long-term fiscal commitments.  Other countries have successfully shown the way on this, so we should seek to have a 20-year capital plan.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, we believe the Government should use the unallocated &euro;2.65 billion to enhance competitiveness in light of geopolitical challenges.  The most pressing of these is Brexit, but there are other challenges.  Maintaining a focus on competitiveness is the key request.  Housing supply, commuting and travel times represent the most practical and quantifiable measures under which the greater Dublin area can improve its international offering in a relatively short timeframe.  Investment in housing and transport will also have a huge impact on quality of life for citizens in Dublin as well as supporting further growth and investment.<\/p> <p>  Metro North and the DART underground should both be prioritised in the capital investment plan.  The Metro North is essential connectivity and it is also essential to easing urban congestion.  Fingal in north County Dublin has a population of almost 300,000.  It is the third most populous county in Ireland and is the fastest growing.  Between the census of 2011 and the census of 2016 the population growth in Fingal far outstripped that of the five counties of Connacht.  We must put investment where the people choose to live.  The DART underground was first mooted in 1971, yet we still do not have it.<\/p><p>Again, there are opportunity costs to that and that has been a drag on the development of the city.  Resources must be allocated to enhancing the existing public transport system, reducing commuting times, easing congestion and better delivery of health and environmental outcomes.<\/p><p> We also believe that Dublin Bus services play a hugely important role in the city's transport system and that bus priority and bus only corridors are a highly efficient way of transporting large numbers of people at peak traffic times.  There are opportunities to upgrade ticketing and payment systems through allowing the use of contactless cards and phone pay, in addition to the Leap card.  Improvements in cycling and walking infrastructure could also be achieved at relatively low cost but with very significant rewards in terms of traffic management and in health and environmental outcomes.<\/p><p> In terms of planning, complementary services such as Dublin Bikes, cycle lanes and bus stops should be located as close as possible to the existing rail stops to enhance commuter convenience and to encourage people to use public transport.<\/p><p> The other key area for capital investment is the Dublin water supply.  The threat to water shortages in Dublin has been internationally recognised, with a Stanford University study in 2014 identifying Dublin as one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to water shortages in the future.  The eastern and midlands water supply project is vitally important and it must not be delayed.  We ask that Government would clarify the implications of the EUROSTAT determination that Irish Water remains on the State's balance sheets, the implications of that for the capital investment plan as a whole and that it commits fully to funding the eastern and midlands water supply project.<\/p><p> That is the summary of our recommendations.  We would be delighted to answer any questions and go into each of those points in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke, and I thank her for her brevity.

I commend their constructive opening contribution which contained many interesting ideas.  The starting point for all of us now in terms of capital spend over the next while will be the national planning framework and how that works out.  The logic of it is good in the sense that it does not seek to take from Dublin.  We need a thriving capital city.  There are capacity issues but there is further scope for development in Dublin.  However, there is a big demand on the State regarding capital spend.  Leaving aside the infrastructural capital projects, some of which Ms Burke highlighted, we also have the need to build the national maternity hospital and the national children's hospital.  We have demands in third and fourth level, where there is a dearth of capital investment, health care and so on.  We then have the need for transport investment and other investments.  That is just in Dublin alone; we have not even gone outside of Dublin.  Obviously, there will have to be a prioritising of what is possible.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to my first question.  Ms Burke cited in her opening statement a greater use of public private partnerships, PPPs.  A number of organisations and witnesses have come before this committee.  Some of them are more supportive of PPPs while some are less supportive.  Some economists have question marks over them and some are more supportive.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has done a good deal of work in this area and it has concerns regarding accountability, a failure to do look-back exercises to see whether we are getting bang for buck.  Before we can embark on more PPPs, there is a school of thought that we should have more hard analysis of whether, as taxpayers, we get value for money for them.  Can Ms Burke give us examples from her perspective of what did represent value for money in terms of PPPs?  How would she respond not just to the Comptroller and Auditor General but also to the many economists on this?  Colm McCarthy has been a strong critic of public private partnerships.  There is a body of opinion on them.<\/p> <p>  My second issue concerns capital spend outside Dublin.  In her opening statement Ms Burke spoke about the need to examine where population growth is in the State.  There is an intention, and it is something that underpins the national planning framework, that we have to build regional cities outside Dublin.  That will require capital spending as well.  How do we make sure we can do all of that while at the same time making sure we have the capital spend for the Dublin area?<\/p> <p>  In terms of my final question, when any group makes a demand for increased resources we have a responsibility to ask how we will pay for that.  The question to Ms Burke and her organisation is that if it is recommending that we increase spending and capital areas, how will that be paid for?  Will it be through cuts in services elsewhere or through increased revenue?  If it is through increased revenue, what are those options?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Ms Aebhric McGibney, to respond on the national planning framework and the PPP question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The history of PPPs has evolved in the past 20 years.  Ireland has become quite good at using PPPs and they are used as an exemplar for some of the projects in terms of how a good PPP project is worked.  The argument used against PPPs generally is that Government financing is cheaper but that misses the point that with regard to private finance, which might have a slightly higher rate, there is a full transfer of risk if it is done correctly.  It will then be off balance sheet, which is the possible solution to Ireland's desperate need to invest heavily in capital infrastructure.  There is a good deal of public debate about whether projects have worked very well and whether the investment is worth it.  There is then scope change and things happen but if we lock down a project and say, \"We would like you to build this and the risk and all the challenges are transferred to the private sector\", there is a huge benefit to that.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the work done by the European Investment Bank, EIB.  A group involving the EIB and the Government is looking at a range of private finance options and getting the EIB involved in supporting projects here.  There is a particular window of opportunity arising from the proposed exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union in that there are many officials with expertise in that area.  The EIB, once it comes into a project, would certainly ensure that it was very much above board and of a very high standard.  PPPs have improved as projects and the expertise of the EIB in bringing that on board is an opportunity we should not miss.<\/p> <p>  In terms of value for money, we face a real challenge.  I cannot have a meaningful debate with any of the members without value for money or cost benefit analysis of any capital project because any project over &euro;5 million is assessed by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, given a cost benefit analysis and then the analysis is redacted.  We cannot see the cost or the benefit, so we cannot have a meaningful discussion.  It is beholden on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to produce something more meaningful with which we can engage.  There is a challenge regarding commercial issues.  If I tell the members I have &euro;100 in my pocket, the risk is that any supplier will try to charge me up to &euro;100.  If there is competition in the market among people bidding for projects, one would think it would be less than the &euro;100 in my pocket.  Even allowing for that, there must be a way of ranking projects according to benefit.  DART underground was given, in one of the less redacted papers, a benefit to cost ratio of 2:4.  Could we see an assessment of all the range of projects that come out of the medium-term capital spending review assessed in that fashion?  That would be very helpful.  If there are better ways we would welcome the Department's expertise in trying to provide a framework where we can have that kind of meaningful discussion about how we can get good value for money from projects.<\/p> <p>  I think I am covering the points.  With regard to the question of financing, it is a critical issue.  We certainly believe that there is scope to query the Stability and Growth Pact, the \"six pack\" and the various rules.  Under the latest revision of those rules this year there is an opportunity to invest in productive capital spending if it can be shown to increase the growth rate of the economy on a once-off basis; we are allowed do it once.  We believe there is a pressing need to jump start the huge capital deficit the economy faces.  That higher growth rate will in turn generate revenues.  There are any number of self-sufficient arguments made to the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>Every scheme always pays for itself in some way, but we believe if projects are properly evaluated, and the returns to the Exchequer and the economy are properly assessed, they will provide their own returns.  If the Deputy recalls, when we had the big national debt problem in the 1980s, the amount we owed did not fall.  It was still &pound;120 billion or &pound;130 million.  The economy grew and that is how our debt to GDP ratio fell.  Some consideration should be given to this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>There was a question on regional centres outside of Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I can say a little on this.  The national planning framework speaks about developing urban areas.  There is clear evidence internationally, from the European Union and the OECD, that city regions are how businesses and economies will tend to grow in future.  We absolutely support the development of other city regions.  One of the challenges that came out of the most recent spatial strategy is that it means not everywhere in Ireland can be a locus or focal point for growth.  However, we think that with proper planning, regions surrounding urban areas can also benefit if they are linked and connected and plugged into them.  This is a solution.  Deputies may not be aware that jobs are recorded by where people live.  They are not recorded by where they are and when we see growth in jobs in Kildare, it is often because of people commuting on the dual carriageway to get to the M50 to be in a traffic jam.  The growth in Dublin is actually supporting jobs outside it, in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and much further afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I believe the comments made by Mr. McGibney on the publication of cost-benefit analysis should apply to the committee.  We are supposed to be a budgetary oversight committee but I must confess we do not get this information in any detailed meaningful way.  This committee is part of new politics, but very little additional information is provided to it.  If it was in order, we should write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to request we get this information and that organisations such as Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which does a lot of work among businesses in the wider Dublin region, should also be able to obtain data.  It is essential.  As a body very involved with many employers establishing businesses broadly in the Leinster and Dublin regions, this information is absolutely vital in supporting the decision by a business to make an investment in Ireland or supporting the decision of a local firm which is expanding to continue.<\/p> <p>  Does the chamber support making Dublin city a living wage city?  One of the problems for people working in the city at present and for businesses is that the shortage of housing and the spiral in rents, traditional low-wage jobs, very often in the retail sector which is big in Dublin, mean it is not possible for people to live.  The type of contracts people get, where hours are insufficient, means that often they are not in a position to approach banks or, at times, credit unions with a view to get extra mortgages.  I know this is not the subject of today's discussion, but it is very important to have quality jobs and decent pay and conditions for people.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the projects, has the chamber had a discussion with the Government about the break and gag on capital expenditure in Ireland because of the total inflexibility of the fiscal rules?  We are a small country.  We cannot avail of the Juncker plan because it is only available to larger countries, and it is not even particularly available to countries such as France and Italy because of the debt levels.  There is a huge amount of money floating around the EU, and countries such as Ireland, which have good investment prospects in terms of public investment, cannot access it.  Would the witnesses agree the European Investment Bank and public private partnerships are, in many ways, a poor substitute for direct state investment if the deficit rules looked at capital investment separately to current investment?  There is obviously scope at different times for many styles of investment but, at present, we are strangled as a country and a city in terms of capacity for capital investment.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask specific questions about public transport in Dublin.  One of the cheapest and fastest things that can be done is the electrification of the suburban railway lines from south and north Kildare into Dublin city and their connections on to other large towns and cities.  What is the sense of the witnesses of where the Government is at on this?  For example, the Maynooth line should have been electrified a long time ago.  We could have a DART service on the Maynooth line, which would increase the carrying capacity of the carriages.  We also have on the west side of Dublin, into Kildare and west Dublin, which I represent, significant capacity for the additional building of homes in areas where people would like to buy and where we could have social housing.  Given Dublin Chamber of Commerce is such a major body in the city, has it had an opportunity to discuss this with the Government?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the comments made on buses, Dublin Bus in my view has improved its service substantially and all credit to the people who work there and provide the service.  However, it is now dangerously overcrowded because there are just not enough buses.  The development of the app by Dublin Bus and the real-time information on bus movements at many bus stops have revolutionised Dublin Bus in a positive way.  It is a tribute to the public sector that it has done this, but it does not have enough services.  When it is off peak, there are definitely not enough services.  If we really want to shift people from the car to public transport, the extension of the DART to other suburban rail services, of which there are quite a number in the Dublin area, would be a very fast win, but it would require an amount of investment.  Longer term projects such as metro north are very valuable, but today we have seen the statement by one of the leading people associated with the transport sector that it could not even start before 2022.  It would be helpful to us as a committee if Dublin Chamber of Commerce could look at the timeline with regard to the projects on the list.  I will give an example of a recent Government decision which I completely fail to understand.  There is a strategic development zone in Hansfield in west Dublin, which has capacity for 3,000 houses, provided road access is developed.  This road access is expensive but not massively so, and when the Government recently announced a small spend of &euro;200 million on access to get housing sites started, it was specifically excluded in a way that simply makes no sense to me.  Given that the committee is about budgetary oversight and spending money to get the best return and best value, I am really confused by some of the decisions, or lack of decisions, of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#D00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will take the points the Deputy has made and I will ask Mr. McGibney to comment on some of them in more depth.

Buses are an immediate stopgap.  Metro North is predicted to go ahead in 2021 after the planning and consultation phases are complete, with an earliest possible date of 2026 or 2027 for passenger use.  We cannot wait until 2027 for a transport solution to north Dublin and the airport so buses are the only realistic alternative in the short to medium term, but for that we need changes to the quality bus corridors and the moving stock.  Increasing buses would be good value for money.  Difficult decisions have to be made on certain bus routes because the low-hanging fruit in regard to bus corridors has probably been picked and there are capacity issues on some roads.

There would also be less of a housing problem.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government gives figures showing a potential supply of 175,000 sites in the county of Dublin.  It lists various categories, what is enabled and what not enabled, what has planning permission and water, roads, etc., but the failure to progress housing supply is lack of infrastructure, including water but also a transport system.  If we could manage to integrate the two elements to allow the extra supply to come on board it would be a great help.<\/p> <p>  The chamber does not have an ideological position on PPPs and the question of public and private finance.  We do not believe financing must be private just because we are a business body.  In fact, most bundles or packages of finance are public and private finance working together.  There is an expertise in regard to the EIB, of which we can avail.  Capital spending, as a percentage of GDP, should be up at the level of the OECD and EU average, which is upwards of 4% - twice where we are at now.  There should be a bundle of private and public finance on top of that, working together.  The most important thing in using private finance is to have a consistent approach.  In the past we have developed expertise and ramped up private finance on a range of projects and then walked back down the hill again without delivering the project.  If one uses private finance one has to use it consistently.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a timeline, it is hard to break projects down into their component parts each year and to estimate what will be spent in each year.  However, separating larger projects into bundles of smaller projects can allow little pieces to be done that can fit into the overall capital spending plan and can enable projects to be progressed more swiftly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The danger is that all of us, politicians and the witnesses, have not faced reality.  It is all very well saying we could have done this, that and the other four or five years ago but the reality is that the IMF walked into the Department of Finance and took us over.  This country was broke and we keep forgetting that.  The rebuilding of the economy and other priorities were stopped in their tracks.  Nobody would disagree with the need for more capital expenditure but we did not have any money.  We need to look at the submissions in the context of reality and to get some perspective.  In many respects, however, it is a miracle the country is where it is today, after the terrible setback we had.  We must not make the same mistakes again and we have to think outside the norm.<\/p> <p>  What is the witnesses' opinion on how we might get people living within a normal distance from the city as compared to other capitals?  If one lives in London, 20 or 30 miles is nothing yet we are talking about spending vast sums of money to build a vast public transport system from one side of St. Stephen's Green to the other side of the Liffey, when we need to build proper access in the form of roads or rail to areas 30 or 40 miles outside Dublin.  There is always going to be a need for access within the city but where people live is the problem.  I live in the direction of Killiney and if I was to come in at 8 a.m. in a car or a bus it would take anything between 40 minutes and an hour.<\/p><p>On the other hand, if I have access to a proper public transport, and I am fortunate to have that with the DART, I can get into the city from Drogheda and even Dundalk in that time.  When I go to Pearse Station at 5 p.m., the queues of people on the opposite platform travelling north to Dundalk, Drogheda or west to Maynooth are incredible.  More people are living outside the city, which is not a bad thing.  The rat race which results in people having to take on huge mortgages to buy a three-bedroom terraced house in the area represented by me and Deputy Boyd Barrett is a millstone around people's necks that they will never get rid of.  Buying a semi-detached or terraced house out our way for &euro;500,000 is a bargain.  We should discuss how we can encourage people in all walks of life to start thinking about where they live and how the statistics relating to where they live are irrelevant in the context of where they work.  That is the main problem.  We are mixing up where people live and where they work.  It is not a question of extending the DART line two or three miles outside the city at an enormous cost when bus lanes and a rail link could be provided to transport people from 20 or 30 miles away.  It would take the same time as those commuting from eight miles away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#E00800","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I refer to the Deputy's first point about the miracle that the country has survived at all.  It is not a miracle.  We had a construction, banking and public finance collapse, catastrophic as it was for the economy.  In 2009, the private sector and the real economy corrected, which meant job losses at the time.  From that date, it created jobs again and from 2010 onwards we had record year after record year of exports.  The real economy recovered, therefore, and it is on the back of the real economy that the public finances recovered.  I make that point because it is important to note that the infrastructure to support the real economy is the substance of our report and that is what we are discussing.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to where people live and where the work and how they get from A to B, distance is important.  We know from the 300,000 people working for our members that they do not want to be shipped in from commuter towns.  They do not want to spend their time even on efficient public transport.  They want to be able to live near where they work, they want a short consistent commute time and they want to be able to live in the city.  Dublin is like a doughnut city at the moment because of a failure of housing policy going back decades and multiple Administrations.  Other cities in which people enjoy a good quality of life manage to have high quality, high density living in a small nucleus within them.  For instance, people in Copenhagen have a good quality of life.  The city is not congested with cars but that did not happen overnight.  They dealt with congestion and sprawl and they said that was not the way they wanted to live their lives.  They had cross-party agreement and 30-year plans to allow for the proper development of the city.  We would like a housing policy that would encourage high density, high quality living in Dublin.  Rathmines is a village in the city, which is an example of working high density.  It is an attractive place to live.  Our experience of what we think is high density such as the towers in Ballymun was not high density at all.  They were medium rise, low density towers and they were a failure of social policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>What about high rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>We would like to see high rise, high density, high quality housing in designated areas in the city centre and not sprawled around the city.

What are her members saying to her about the impact of the shortage of housing for their employees on their businesses?  With regard to commuting times, how does Dublin compare to London?   When I lived in London, anywhere within an hour of the city was considered a good commute and I travelled for approximately one hour door to door.  That was normal.  What does Ms Burke consider to be a short commute and to be reasonable?  I very much agree with Deputy Barrett that we need to realise that people cannot live in the city centre next door to their workplace.  It is acceptable and reasonable to think that in a city that will expand that people should live further outside and commute using good public transport links.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Burke's comments on quality of life.  She said that population growth in Fingal between the 2011 and 2016 censuses outstripped that of the five Connacht counties.  As somebody who lives in Connacht, I take a different view.  The lack of investment in our region has led people to migrate to Dublin who do not want to be there.  My constituents do not want to spend two miserable hours each way in their cars travelling from Lucan to the city centre to work long hours with poor services.  They would like to live elsewhere in the country if services, including proper transportation links, were provided.  There is a balance to be struck.  I understand Ms Burke's representations come from Dublin city and surrounding areas but we have a country to look after and capital investment needs to be levelled at all areas in the country.  Part of the reason Dublin is experiencing such huge problems is we are forcing people to migrate to the city and we are not providing opportunities for them to work and live in other parts of the country.  There are no jobs in those areas and they do not have the infrastructure to attract investment.  With regard to the lack of infrastructure in the north west, Ms Burke would be shocked by the low level of investment in the region and how difficult it is to attract investment and create jobs for our people.  It is something to think about.  We are dealing with this issue as representatives of the entire country.<\/p> <p>  Issues such as the overheating of the housing market, high rents, traffic congestion and water supply shortages are the result of forcing people to live in Dublin.  The chamber wants to push them into the city centre and expects that the current infrastructure will support that or can be built on and layered up to the point where people can live on top of each other.  That is no life.  Older blocks have much larger apartments but people are expected to live in little boxes in modern apartment blocks.  It was reported earlier than 42 properties in a development in Clonskeagh sold out within one day ranging in price from &euro;400,000 to &euro;770,000.  I am sure the &euro;400,000 properties had no more than two bedrooms.  We are telling people to live in tiny accommodation, like little shoe boxes, that is not fit for family growth.  If transport links were extended to other parts of the country to allow people to live in bigger and better housing units that can accommodate families, we would do much better in assisting the Dublin area and reducing the overheating in the market.  Those are my comments as someone who lives on the other side of the country where we see the issues a little differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#F00500","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Unusually, when we ask businesses what are the biggest challenges facing them, housing is number one.

If we do not get growth in the economy and raise living standards, the national planning framework and how we grow the economy will be a failure.  Spending is set in the context of where the national planning framework is going to evolve.  The national spatial strategy, which tried to prioritise 22 towns and several other ancillary towns, did not work at a time when public spending was not really constrained.  We spent a lot of money.  Was it sustainable in terms of the economic activity and the lifestyles it supported?  Transport is a big issue.  We do not have the cost-benefit analysis as we discussed.  Higher density does not automatically mean height.  In many other cities, there are between three and six storeys.  It does not have to be 20 storey mega towers.  People need to live closer together.  This is a challenge for the whole of Ireland.  If there is more one-off housing, if people move out, the service costs for health, education and transport are higher than when people are clumped together in towns and cities.  Perversely, recent incentives are to get people into towns having let them build a house a couple of miles outside the town.<br\/><br\/>It is not the case that Dublin has received more capital spending than anywhere else in the country.  It is at the bottom of the list.  Edgar Morgenroth at the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced figures for spending <i>per capita<\/i>which show that for Dublin it is two thirds of the national average.  Every other region gets more capital spending than Dublin.  My only caveat is that the data goes up to 2009.  No more recent data can be prepared because the data is not produced in order to make the analysis.  We need more data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on national income accounting figures and we need more information from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

Someone from there told me recently that they have an accommodation issue for people who come to work there, particularly seasonal workers.  It would be regarded as an average size town.  It is not just a Dublin issue.<\/p> <p>  We have tabled a Private Members' motion for tomorrow evening on traffic congestion in Dublin.  It is interesting to see the feedback on that.  Part of the aim of the motion is to get the heads of people in Dublin and the commuter counties around the fact that there is no silver or magic bullet.  It will be at least 2027 before the major infrastructural projects we are talking about will be in place, if we are lucky, yet the witnesses know that the answer to a question I tabled to the Minister on the cost of congestion to the city, according to the CSO, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and modelling systems, was &euro;350 million per annum.  That is estimated to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  The amount of infrastructure that could be built with &euro;2 billion per annum is substantial.  <\/p> <p>  I have not heard the phrase \"real economy\" used for a while.  I am hoping Ms Burke used it unconsciously.  I really dislike it because it implies that nobody else is doing anything economically meaningful unless they own a business that employs people and produces or manufactures something.  I would argue that teachers educate the people who populate her \"real economy\".  Doctors and nurses care for them and make them well so that they can turn up for work in her \"real economy\" and public servants keep the whole machinery of the \"real economy\" moving.  The real economy is everybody.  It is not just business and everybody played some kind of part in the recovery.<\/p><p>I am aware that business took the biggest hit in employment numbers and profits, suffered much damage and has recovered.  I am also aware that tourism, which is very much an understated asset in this country, probably proved to be the most resilient product that Dublin had to offer during that time, and withstood many pressures that came from the crash.  In spite of that we invest very little in research and development on it as a State, compared to cities elsewhere, and I would like to hear what the chamber thinks of that.<\/p><p> On high-density development, the witnesses know that there used to be double-decker or triple-decker houses in the United States.  The suburbs can offer potential for sustainable high-density development, but people have to be led.  People like Mr. Dermot Bannon, the architect, are critical in that because they are trusted figures in the public eye.  It feels like they are late to the debate because it is a matter that I had considered a long time ago as a politician, but their entry to the debate is important because people trust them.  Mr. Dermot Bannon recently repeated what the witnesses were saying, that Dublin is not just like a doughnut, but like a saucer, where the density gets higher the farther out one goes.  I think the witnesses from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce mentioned Copenhagen.  We have 25% of the density within the boundary of the M50 that Copenhagen would fit in that space.  That is good news too because it means we have much capacity there.<\/p><p> Rathmines is full of derelict bedsits too.  That is the only downside of it.  The reaction to two previous Governments trying to improve standards in bedsits was that the whole thing shut down.  I take the witnesses' point about densities, but there is much dereliction there and much unused accommodation.  Several Governments and city councils have tried to incentivise the re-use of those, and it has been really difficult to do that.<\/p><p> Major infrastructural projects are a decade away and the Minister, the Government and the NTA have told us that, without ever asking us or consulting with the public; we do not have a choice now but to accept that public transport is the only way to alleviate future traffic gridlock.  What steps do the witnesses envisage may be necessary during that decade in traffic demand management and in entry and access to the city from the commuter belt?  Some 70% of employees in Wicklow come to the city.  Some 40% of Kildare working people come to Dublin.  That will keep growing.  I imagine some serious thinking will need to be done in a proactive way, or we are going to have to react in a crisis at some stage down the road.<\/p><p> Five of the top eight tech companies are based here in the city and I met one of the lead people from one of them.  I am always fascinated that this company's major selling point is that it manages data.  It has a huge amount of expertise in the data management area.  We have a huge amount of expertise in university faculties.  The State has invested hundreds of millions of euro in this over the years, in transport, climate change and other areas.  Does anyone ever ask these bodies to get involved in designing solutions for Dublin?  Have any of the tech companies ever been approached, whether by Dublin City Council or the NTA, to see if they have something to offer with regard to providing solutions and managing data, at which these companies are experts?

One of the biggest reasons that Fingal's population is growing is that household size is increasing.  That is because kids are staying at home with mum and dad and have not moved out.

I could only say so much because some of that was going into D&uacute;n Laoghaire, or it was going into the city or to Fingal or wherever.<\/p> <p>  That is the kind of data harnessing I am talking about.  There are people with a really high level of expertise that could do something with data that we cannot, and who could help solve those problems.  It is not going to be a silver bullet but it is something that could contribute to it.  If we have five of those companies based here, they have a phenomenal amount of information about people, including Dublin people, their movements, their habits and trends.  We are not using any of it.  That is what my question is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#H00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that if the data is produced and then made available publicly, that would be a great help.  I mentioned the 2009 estimate on capital spending per head.  That is no longer able to be updated because the data is not produced to allow the analysis.  We have evidence of the city making more of its data freely available to applications and to companies to analyse, and that is a good example.  It is a commercial choice for Dublin City Council and the other local authorities, because they can sell the data. <\/p> <p>  The real data problem we are facing here from a transport and land-use perspective is that we are working off the 2011 census.  The 2016 census is out but the data on where people live, where they go to work and how long it takes them will not be out until next year.  If we could progress that - if it is a matter of resources available - we should, if open data could solve that problem.

It is the real and critical problem we face.  The Deputy referred to the point about the congestion cost in Dublin.  It is worth recording that this was an analysis produced by the NTA.  The last published analysis by its predecessor in 1999 indicated a congestion cost in Dublin of &pound;500 million in punts, or over &euro;1 billion in current terms.  It is quite a conservative estimate.  If it is going from &euro;350 million now to &euro;2 billion in 2030, it is still a very conservative estimate of the cost of what we call \"congestion\".  The long-run future for the evolution of any city will be more to do with public transport, better planning of transport and housing and ensuring public transport is viable by having the density to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aebhric McGibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I apologise for being outside for a few minutes.

We would have got it for half nothing in the middle of the recession and it would be opening now.  It was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that killed the project through a supplicant and unfortunate Minister with responsibility for transport, who was one of the Deputy's own colleagues.  That is who killed it at the very time we should have built it.  We would have got funding.  It was the perfect countercyclical infrastructure investment project.<\/p> <p>  I also must disagree with the Deputy who said it would be great if we all travelled long distances in.  I could not agree more with Ms Mary Rose Burke from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I was in London at the weekend.  One should look at what our competitor cities are doing.  I was near Bermondsey, an area that was empty 15 years ago but which is now packed and within walking distance of the City of London.  That is what we should be aiming for and it is what we are competing against.  Do we want to go to Bermondsey or some other area?  The Government published a website recently which sets out the massive extent of public land available to us which is close to the centre but which we are under-utilising.  That is what we need to develop.<\/p> <p>  Having made that general case, I have some further points.  I am glad Ms Burke mentioned the need for investment in cycling infrastructure, albeit it is not listed among the chamber's priority.  I would place it as the first priority in Dublin because in terms of immediate responses, we have six projects which are ready to go.  The Liffey cycle route currently has approximately 1,000 cyclists and a similar number of motorists.  If we get the same 50% increase in cycling capacity there that we did on the Grand Canal, it will be the most immediate capacity response to adopt.  That is what London, Paris and New York are doing.  It is what our competing cities are doing.  It is not just the Liffey cycle route, it is the College Green project which was announced yesterday and the Sutton-to-Sandycove project which would make a very nice cycle from D&uacute;n Laoghaire into town.  It is the Dodder greenway, the Santry greenway and the Tolka greenway.  These are projects we have been planning for decades and which are close to being ready to go but which have no funding and, I must say, not enough political support.  When the Liffey cycle route was before the council last week, we saw that there was insufficient political support.  That is a real problem.  They are not necessarily cheap.  To do the Sutton-to-Sandycove route properly would require a fair bit of funding.  Cycling is not just the tail end of spending, but should be 10% of our transport budget.  In Dublin, those are the six arterial congestion solving, capacity improving, lifestyle enhancing projects which should be the No. 1 priority ahead of all the other projects the witnesses mentioned.  Either we do them now or we give up on trying to make Dublin a safe cycling city.  Having spent 25 years trying to achieve that, the Dublin cycling campaign deserves the support of the Chamber of Commerce in relation to those projects.<\/p> <p>  I disagree fundamentally with the Chamber of Commerce on the need for an outer orbital or eastern bypass.  One cannot say on the one hand that we need to invest in public transport and then on the other hand dangle the prospect of massive new road projects.  We are already doing that with the widening of the N7 which should not be coming ahead of public transport projects.  There is no demand of any scale to justify the multi-billion cost of an eastern bypass for people to get from Stillorgan and its environs to the airport.  If we are going to build a metro to the airport, let that take them there.  There is no demand for that road.  In any of the modelling I have seen from the Dublin transportation office or elsewhere, there is no crowd of people looking to get from the southside of Dublin to Whitehall or Balbriggan or any point in between.  If there is, they should be using the DART and the metro.  We do not need an eastern bypass and even less do we need an outer orbital.  The outer orbital simply fits into the mad IBEC policy presented to us here regarding 1,500 km of motorways nationally as if climate change did not exist and as if we had learned nothing in terms of sprawl and the doughnutting of our cities which has gone on in the last 20 or 30 years.  The Chamber of Commerce has said on the one hand it wants to stop the doughnut effect but on the other it has included the outer orbital in its submissions, which is to build another ring around the doughnut.  That does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Our preference is for a smart, liveable, walkable and cycleable city and that depends on a certain public policy ethos to support such a goal with high density living to some extent in the city centre and reduced commute times.  From the work we have done, it appears that an acceptable commute is of the order of about 30 minutes.  That would put us on a par with other competitive cities.  I take Deputy Ryan's point about the orbital ring road.  It is included in our policies because if we do not get DART underground and metro north, we will have no alternative because the city will grind to a halt.  Our focus is on ensuring the city continues to be able to function as a competitive one and in that regard we have choices to make.  One is to make a full commitment to public transport on a long-term basis - and I mentioned a 20-year capital investment plan earlier - because we cannot have this stop-go, stop-go approach.  In the absence of that commitment, we will need an orbital ring-road because the M50 will be a car park.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>What about cycle routes and the other points Deputy Ryan mentioned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J00600","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>We support the city advancing as a cycle city.

The same problem exists with the Liffey cycle route which we should be introducing at the same time the Luas starts to cross the river near O'Connell Bridge.

I cannot understand why and I cannot understand how he fails to see the logic of developing the city in the way the chamber sees it.

There is a great deal to talk about in all of this but I will try to touch on a few things.<\/p><p> I welcome the emphasis on joined-up integrated planning, public transport infrastructure and the critical importance of investing.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that such matters are critical.  It is possible to provide more quality bus lanes and buses quickly, but we are going in the opposite direction by cutting orbital bus routes or by privatising them, which will amount to the same thing in many cases.  I do not know whether the chamber is speaking out about this.  There has been a pattern of slashing subsidies to public transport.  They have increased slightly in the last year, but they are well below what they were before the crash in 2008.  I do not know whether the witnesses agree with my view that if we are serious about affordable public transport, a much higher level of public subsidy needs to be provided not only for the development of public transport infrastructure but also for the affordability of public transport to make it an attractive option.  Subsidies are needed.  Our public transport subsidies are well below the rest of Europe.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> I welcome the witnesses' emphasis on the critical urgency of providing housing to accommodate the people who need it.  Investment in this city will stall if we do not have enough affordable housing.  I agree that we need to increase densities, but I do not agree that this necessarily involves massive heights on the scale alluded to by the witnesses.  Would they agree with me that we could start looking at all the derelict sites that could potentially be developed?  I can think of three such sites off the top of my head - The huge site at Apollo House, which was occupied recently, is just sitting there.  The motor tax office behind the Four Courts has been derelict for last six or seven years.  The Ormond Hotel on the quays is also derelict.  I am sure we could think of many more.  I have mentioned three examples off the top of my head.  We know there are 55,000 empty units in Dublin, which is shocking.  We do not know how many of them are under the control of NAMA.  God knows what was going on there.  The number of empty units is larger than the number of people on the housing list.  There are 44,000 people on the housing list in Dublin.  We could start by doing something about the empty units.  There is also a need to build some more units.<\/p><p> The witnesses seem to be nodding as they listen to many of my ideas.  I think there is broad agreement on many of these issues.  I am glad everybody agrees there is a need to bust through the self-defeating fiscal rules.  I take it from their presentation that the witnesses agree that this is needed.  Similarly, the state aid rules are far too restrictive.  I think the state aid rules are a major problem for our capacity to make the necessary strategic decisions about strategic industries or strategic infrastructure.  This is also of relevance to rural areas that will be affected by Brexit.  If we are going to diversify our economy to deal with things like Brexit, the State needs to be able to make strategic decisions to invest in key areas without being hampered by rules that are somewhat irrational.<\/p><p> I have a bone to pick with the witnesses regarding their emphasis on PPPs.  I do not see the rationale for such arrangements.  Could the witnesses explain what it is?  Many PPPs in the housing area collapsed in recent years.  Mr. McGibney referred to the idea that all the risk is transferred to the private sector, but that is not what happens in a PPP.  The private sector gets the gains if it goes well and we take the hit if it does not go well.  We pay and we still take the risk.  If it goes well, the private investor runs off with the profit.  This applies to PPPs in areas like toll bridges, toll roads and housing.  Deputy Barrett will be interested to know that I recently discussed the need for student accommodation with officials from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT.  They have been told by the Government that no money is available for capital investment in student accommodation.  I was shocked to hear that no money is available for such accommodation in the teeth of a massive housing crisis.  Student accommodation is part of the housing crisis.  The provision of such accommodation would take pressure off other areas of the rental market.  The IADT personnel were told that no money is available for infrastructure of this kind and that even if it were possible, it would have to be a PPP.  I do not see the rationale for that.  If student accommodation is built 100% by the institution, funded by the State, the rental revenue will come back to the college.  If it is a PPP, the rental revenue will go to somebody else and not go back into education.  If the private company goes bust, we will still end up picking up the tab.  I do not see why we support these PPPs.  They do not have a good record.  They tend to cost more.  Money is put in by the public sector and, if any gains are derived as a result, money goes out to the private sector.  Most of the companies involved in PPPs are big investors rather than the small and medium-sized businesses that the chamber mostly represents.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude by asking about the big corporates with which the chamber engages.  Do the witnesses agree that we need to start making the case that these should start paying a bit more tax?  They benefit from and need some of the infrastructure about which we are talking.  I think our educated workforce is one of the biggest reasons the American multinationals are here.  In fact, the representatives of the IADT confirmed this to me when I met them the other day.  They said the big IT firms contact them all the time looking for the IADT's graduates because they are of such a high quality.  This tells me that investment in education and in people has all sorts of positive spin-offs.  However, these companies do not want to contribute towards investment in such infrastructure.  Equally, their employees need affordable places to live, but they do not want to pay the taxes needed to fund the kind of affordable housing infrastructure that could accommodate those employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#J01100","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494342000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to address some of the points he has made.  Bus routes will be sustainable if the areas they serve have sufficient population density to ensure the buses on those routes operate at capacity.  I take the point that a lot of key transport infrastructure will always need an element of subsidy.  It is quite difficult to make orbital routes, in particular, operate on a fully commercial basis.  For that reason, they will need long-term subsidies.<\/p> <p>  I agree that a large part of the solution to the housing crisis can be found by looking at derelict sites and buildings and brownfield and infill sites in the city.  New-builds are also needed as part of a multifaceted approach.<\/p> <p>  Investment in infrastructure is required as part of the solution to the challenge the country faces in the context of Brexit.  We need to be competitive in response to the various external challenges, including Brexit, we are facing as a small open economy.  That is why much of our focus is on transport infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  If the State had unlimited wealth, of course it would fund these projects from its own resources rather than through PPPs, but that is not the reality.  PPPs are part of the solution where the State needs to address critical bottlenecks in infrastructure investment.  While they are slightly more expensive than the rate at which the Government can borrow money, it is worth noting that there are constraints on how much money the State can borrow.<\/p> <p>  That brings us back to the rules.  We have long argued that the fiscal rules are absolutely appropriate when it comes to current expenditure.  We need some kind of deviation or derogation from the fiscal rules when it comes to capital investment in support of a growing population that is contrary to the European trajectory on populations in other cities.  We support the rules for current expenditure, but we would like to see much more ambition in respect of capital expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The other issue with PPPs is that in the absence of public, private or joint funding, that bit of the kit does not get built at all.<\/p><p>That is not a costless decision because it costs us in terms of the &euro;350 million, projected to &euro;2 billion in 2030, for congestion.  There are many other opportunity costs if we do not build the infrastructure in the first place.<\/p><p> When it comes to corporate taxation, we are clear that part of the offer which makes Ireland and Dublin attractive for foreign direct investment is a suite of products such as stable Government, a stable and pro-business policy environment, a good education system and a stable tax environment.  What corporates need is stability and to be able to project.  They do not want a stop-go on, say, education.  Instead, they want key infrastructure and for it to be attractive for their people to live and work here.  They also need a stable tax policy.  The totality and the talent is a large part of that.  Tax is not the only reason they come here.  It is an important part of our offering.  In light of many of the changes happening elsewhere, I would caution against policy changes which would remove that confidence in a consistent policy environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017050900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494342000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I obviously talk much about the corporate tax regime.

We are good at doing distributional analysis.  The ESRI has its SWITCH, simulating welfare and income tax changes, model.  Every time a budget comes out, it provides an analysis by decile of how many people benefit and how many lose.  There is no real framework to engage in terms of what happens if one increases or cuts taxes, however.  I would argue if one increases taxes, one gets less of an activity.  Sometimes things do not happen that one might want and one gets less revenue, perversely.  At other times, maybe one gets more revenue.  I have no framework, however, to engage on that because there is no analysis from the Department of Finance that is published that allows us to discuss this.<\/p> <p>  The biggest issue for many SMEs is not corporation tax but capital gains tax.  It is about financing.  It is not about them making the money but how somebody can invest and take a risk in their business.  The UK has a 10% entrepreneur relief while there is much more limited scheme being developed here.  We noted when capital gains tax was reduced a decade ago, we got much more revenue.  We might disagree or not about policy but I do not have a framework to engage on what happens when one increases taxes on capital gains or income tax.

In certain sections, the terminology of the Bill should be revised.<br \/><br \/>2.  An enforcement mechanism should be included in the Bill. <br \/><br \/>3. Any potential drafting deficiencies in the Bill may be best addressed during the Committee Stage debate of the Bill.  The Joint Committee also believes that the Minister, with the assistance of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, could propose amendments to rectify any drafting problems by drafting a suitable amendment at either Committee or Report Stages of the Bill. <br \/><br \/>4. The scope of the Bill should be expanded to take account of other activities, such as those that use geothermal technologies, which may be used to access shale gas through other means.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment ensures that the first three recommendations are taken on board.

I also thank all of the members of the Oireachtas joint committee who compiled the pre-legislative scrutiny report that was launched last month.  I thank the Members who attended the launch and recently spoke to the media and local groups that attended.<\/p> <p>  The report, which firmly supports the need and scope of my Bill, was yet another indication that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as a whole, is committed to acting to prohibit the process of fracking from ever being allowed to occur in this country.  It joins the unique moment on a day in September 2016 whereby all parties bar none in the D&aacute;il came together to speak in support of the Bill on Second Stage.  I wish to state for the record of the committee that I have brought the Minister's amendments that were before us today to the close attention of the communities in both counties Sligo and Leitrim.  Over the past number of weeks I have analysed and discussed the amendments with groups such as Lovely Leitrim, Good Energies Alliance Ireland and others.  They have informed me this week that the amendments have been accepted on the ground and they welcome what has happened here this evening.  On that note, the speed and momentum with which this Bill has cleared pre-legislative scrutiny and Committee Stage must be highlighted.  Others outside of the House have overlooked the difficult political realities and requirements involved when writing legislation.  I wish to acknowledge, in particular, the scrutiny required when dealing with a Private Members' Bill and the politics involved in having such Bills accepted by the Government and the Department.  I acknowledge that this Bill is unique legislation that has moved very quickly through the Houses.  I acknowledge each and every person involved and thank them for their efforts.  No efforts have been made to undermine or delay the legislation.  I suspect that the Bill could not have proceeded any quicker and I ask the Minister of State to clarify this.<\/p> <p>  I am a humble backbencher from the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  For me, today is a groundbreaking moment in Irish politics.<\/p><p>I am aware that a Private Members' Bill, let alone one from a non-committee member, rarely if ever reaches Committee Stage in the legislative process.

The Government has accepted this Bill and I presume that it will table its own amendments to improve the legislation.  I anticipate that the Bill will reach Report and Final Stages quickly and will make substantial progress by the summer recess.

I wish to raise a political matter even though I know is not the responsibility of this committee.  I would like everybody to discuss, in a joined-up manner, whether my concerns are justified or unfounded.  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is being signed by over 20 countries at the moment and we are about to sign up to it also.  We have briefly discussed CETA before.  As far as I know, CETA can allow for interference in local rules when it comes to making decisions about free trade under this agreement.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That committee discussed the matter but it was not clarified enough for me.  Perhaps the Minister of State or Deputy McLoughlin who are present will express their views on the following CETA matter.  If CETA is passed there is a possibility that a country like Canada could challenge the law on the basis that it flies in the face of the sentiments of CETA, which is not to block a production or trade agreement that is enshrined by CETA.  There are fracking companies in Canada that may wish to carry out fracking in this country but today's Bill should prevent them from doing so.  Can such companies call for an investigation, considering what is enshrined in the law, into the economic blocking of a Canadian company that wishes to conduct fracking in this country?  Can such a company refer the matter to a court of law citing the trade agreement and a court impose a heavy fine on Ireland for preventing fracking?  I did not get a satisfactory answer to my query from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Perhaps the Minister of State can address my query because I am still unclear about the matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12017050900002#C00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1494347400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I was unable to speak on Committee Stage because I was stuck in the Chamber debating Priority Questions.

It was brought to my attention in advance of the meeting that today, 9 May, is Europe Day, and discussing a project potentially linking the Irish grid to mainland Europe is quite apt.  I am joined today by Rosemary Steen, EirGrid's director of external affairs, and John Fitzgerald, EirGrid's director of grid development.<\/p> <p>  The grid strategy which we published recently, and which I hope members received a copy of in recent days, was first published in draft in 2015.  That reviewed our grid strategy and responded to feedback from the public and public representatives over recent years.  The strategy crystallises a number of core strategic pillars that our work is now based on.  These were that there will be open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities and stakeholders in our approach to network development; that all practical technology options will be considered for network development; and that the existing network will be optimised to minimise requirements for new infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Following the publication in draft, there followed an extensive period of public consultation and regional forums to garner the opinions of communities and organisations from each corner of the country.  The new strategy is very much part of our ongoing efforts to encourage more participation in our decision-making process.  It also reflects an updated economic context, and our growing experience with new technologies.  In addition to these external factors, we have also carefully considered the Government's energy White Paper, and the various economic strategy initiatives undertaken by the Government including the Action Plan for Jobs and the IDA's 2015-2019 strategy.<\/p> <p>  We are always cognisant that we must ensure that the electricity grid is available to fulfil the policy goals set by Government.  To date we have been very successful in integrating renewables into the system.  The Minister, on the radio on Friday, referenced the need to go further in terms of integrating renewables and we are working hard to deliver that policy objective.  The strategy that we have set out is based on all available information to us at this moment, and is an informed view of Ireland's needs as an economy and a society in the coming years.  However, we will continue to review it on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>  A central tenet of our new approach is continuous and ongoing assessment, discussion and debate on the needs for grid development.  For this reason, we have been progressing a new initiative called \"future energy scenarios\".  This brings together the best available data and expertise to ensure that this country's grid is best prepared for all our future electricity requirements.  We have looked carefully at similar organisations abroad which have pioneered a scenario development and planning approach.  On the back of that we have developed four possible scenarios which show how the energy system may evolve years from now and what this means for our economy and society.  This piece of work has been out for consultation for a number of months and we look forward to finalising the scenarios in the next number of weeks.  When finalised, we would welcome an opportunity to present these to the committee if that would be helpful and we would be happy to meet members individually if they wish.<\/p> <p>  Clearly one of the key challenges for EirGrid and the energy sector, along with most other sectors, is the vote of people of the UK in June last year to leave the European Union.  This has introduced new considerations, new challenges and new opportunities for us all.  At EirGrid, our case is unique as we operate the electricity grid in Ireland and Northern Ireland and also operate the all-island wholesale electricity market.  We believe that this remains one of the key tangible benefits of peace and co-operation between North and South and our view is that this should be safeguarded.  Despite the obvious uncertainty that Brexit presents to us all, there has been widespread recognition at official and political level in Brussels, London and here in Dublin that the energy sector on this island should not be negatively impacted by Brexit.  We welcome that and I emphasise my belief that retaining the single electricity market will allow this island to drive innovation in the electricity sector, particularly in terms of delivering value for customers and moving to a more sustainable energy system in the years ahead.  Retaining the single electricity market will ensure the costs of electricity are kept to a minimum for homes and businesses.  Any move from the current system would likely only serve to drive up electricity prices both here and in Northern Ireland and negatively impact competitiveness and security of supply on the whole island.  I think we can all concur that this would be a regressive step.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the proposed Celtic interconnector, and we have a number of slides which will provide some details on the project.  At the committee meeting in February, along with others from the energy sector, committee members were particularly interested in this project and we are delighted to be invited back to give more details.  We have been looking at developing a link to France since 2009, notwithstanding that the recent decision on Brexit by the UK has increased the potential strategic benefits associated with the project.  The Celtic interconnector is a proposed electrical link enabling two-way supply of electricity between Ireland and France.  We have been working with R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE, the national transmission system operator in France, since 2012 to jointly investigate the feasibility of the interconnector.  It would be approximately 600 km in length and would use established technology for subsea long-distance transfer of power.  It would be able to import and export 700 MW of electricity, enough power for 450,000 homes.  The project would undergo full public consultation should it proceed.<\/p> <p>  Our studies to date have shown that it would considerably enhance our security of supply by providing an additional source of power and by diversifying our power sources.  The interconnector would provide Ireland's only energy connection to an EU member state once the UK leaves the EU.  In addition to the key security of supply issue, we believe this project, if completed, would put downward pressure on the cost of electricity.<\/p><p>This would occur due to us securing direct access to the larger continental electricity market.  This will positively impact on the cost of electricity to Irish homes and improve competitiveness across the wider Irish economy.  In addition to these benefits, the studies we have all undertaken to date have shown that the product would bring positive benefits to Ireland in our shared efforts to meet carbon reduction targets.  While these have been shown in preliminary studies to date, we hope to be in a better position to quantify those throughout next year as the studies develop.<\/p><p> At EU level, there has been consistently strong support for the project.  In addition, last July President Hollande and An Taoiseach witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and RTE to progress the project to the next stage of assessment.  The European Union's policy is to establish an integrated European electricity system, and it has designated the Celtic interconnector what is known as a project of common interest.  As a project of common interest, the interconnector will also qualify for financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility.<\/p><p> To date, the Celtic interconnector has received &euro;3.9 million in EU funding for the project's feasibility phase and, more recently, another &euro;4 million has been approved for ongoing work.  Our studies, in conjunction with our French counterparts, have concluded that the interconnector is feasible and beneficial to Ireland and France.  Our shared estimate for the cost of the project is that it will be of the order of &euro;1 billion, depending on the cable demand and prices at the time.  I would emphasise that this cost would be shared between ourselves and the French and, as previously acknowledged, we will also look to Europe for support as this is a key project in delivering on its goal of an energy union.<\/p><p> We are currently working hard on the details of this with RTE and our respective regulators.  If we pass various milestones, we anticipate a decision to proceed with the procurement of the project towards the end of 2018.  If this were achieved, we believe the project could be commissioned in or around 2025.  This means that within nine years Ireland could have a direct connection with mainland European grid and start accruing the considerable benefits this would bring.<\/p><p>   I thank the committee for the opportunity to present and give a very brief overview of the topics.  I am happy to take any questions the Chairman or committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Slye.

I have some brief questions and will unfortunately have to leave the meeting shortly.<\/p> <p>  There have been some significant developments in the area of offshore wind in recent weeks, years and months.  Denmark, Holland and Germany are starting to see offshore wind coming in at five cent per kW hour, which is a fraction of what it was even three or four years ago due to the nature of the bidding system.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the UK Government has changed its modelling forecast for 2030.  The key aspects can be summarised as it forecasting that its PAR demand would come from an additional 12 gW of combined cycle gas, 12 gW of offshore wind and, more interestingly, 12 gW interconnection.  In that regard, it is clear is from listening to the European Commission that projects in the future might include a European co-ordinated project in the Irish Sea.  There could be 3 gW of offshore wind and the Isle of Man could be used as a converter station base.  Scotland could be connected through boot straps and Ireland and Wales could be connected.  It would be a very beneficial project in terms of developing offshore wind competitively and providing energy security for Ireland, Scotland and England.<\/p> <p>  I get no sense that EirGrid is interested in other interconnectors that should be in play.  Why would we allow the project to become a private developer project?  Why would we not continue our tradition of public ownership, including the east-west interconnector, of the transmission assets?  It would make eminent sense.  I believe we would get significant funding from the European Union for the project.  It is a project of common interest and would receive funding from Juncker.  People are dying to invest in this area and the economics are now right. <\/p> <p>  I am delighted that there will be a French interconnector, but how can we roll over the Irish Sea with ambitions?  Having shown that we can do it already, we should be the lead developer in the Irish Sea.  We know how to do it and we should deploy the expertise of the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, Mr. Slye is correct about getting the all-island electricity market right.  Given that we have an interconnector, surely one of the other issues we have to work out in the Brexit negotiations is our east-west trade.  What talks have started in that regard?  It is interesting that Commissioner Barnier will come before the Houses on Thursday.  The Commission seems to be saying that we cannot talk about anything with Britain until the Brexit bill and so on is sorted out. <\/p> <p>  Surely we must talk to National Grid and others about how the east-east interconnector will operate in a post-Brexit world.  Will we have to wait for the Commission to give approval for us to start talking about that sort of stuff?  I would be interested in hearing about the negotiations that are taking place, not just on the island network or pricing arrangements, but those pertaining to the east-west interconnector.<\/p> <p>  If I recall correctly, the last major update in terms of grid investment plans was in 2014.  In some ways, it involves a scaling back of the original grid plans.  Three scenarios were referred to in terms of future demand, that is, low, medium and high.  Can Mr. Slye give me the demand per tW hour for 2016?  Where are we in terms of the low, medium or high scenario?<\/p> <p>  From the outside, it seems that given the number of new data centres that there must be a significant increase in demand.  Is that starting to cause Mr. Slye to question some of the investment forecasts made only three or four years ago when there had not been an increase in growth for several years?  It seems to me that demand must be changing.  Is that forcing EirGrid to consider its investment projects for onshore grid investment within our grid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#C00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the EirGrid representatives.  My questions relate to renewables, the North-South interconnector and the Celtic interconnector.<\/p> <p>  The integration of offshore renewables into the system is an issue.  How does EirGrid see that developing?  Is the grid currently geared up for offshore renewables and micro-generation?  Other European countries have moved very quickly into a system whereby thousands of sources of micro-generation are supplementing larger plants.  In Ireland, we do not seem to have gotten that far yet.  Has any analysis of the replacement of coal from Moneypoint with alternative fuel been carried out?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the North-South interconnector.  There are arguments around undergrounding or overgrounding.  The connection between Belgium and Germany is just over 90 km long.  Has it been analysed in terms of the viability of the underground option?  Could that knowledge be transferred to the North-South interconnector?  It needs to be built and we need to improve the single energy market and ensure it is retained, in particular given Brexit and beyond.  It has to be a key aim of the State to ensure that we do that for the good of the North and South.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slye set out the timescale for the Celtic interconnector and said it could be in place by 2025, which is a very good development.  In terms of funding, have there been any commitments from the European Union?<\/p><p>Have discussions been held with European institutions on supplementing the funding which will be provided by France and Ireland?

Will Mr. Slye clarify the matter?<\/p><p> Of the four scenarios provided of tomorrow&rsquo;s energy supplies, we need to move away from the slow change scenario because it belongs to the last century and involves coal, etc.  For the evolving strategies, it would be better to link the other three scenarios of steady evolution, low-carbon living and consumer action.  On the PowerPoint diagram Mr. Slye has pointed to what this would involve.  We are familiar with electric cars, renewable energy sources, solar panels, consumer action, etc.  Surely the future is those three scenarios.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#C00400","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked, although some of them have been repeated.

We are seeing, as he rightly said, some quite remarkable results from auctions in various European countries in the provision of power from such projects.  In the past six to nine months numbers have come in much more slowly than would have been expected only 12 to 18 months ago.  There are two things happening in this area.  Part of it is due to the fact that people are betting on a technology evolution with bigger and bigger turbine sizes.  The most recent in Germany involves turbine sizes of 13 to 15 MW, which are huge.  Some have other parts included such that the actual transmission connection is provided and the developer does not have to do so.  In some the bank has fully consented and will not have to take the development risk.  Notwithstanding this, offshore wind power generation is happening more and more in these countries and the auction system seems to have worked for them.<br\/><br\/>How do we see the sector developing in Ireland?  To the extent that offshore wind energy project develop, there is much interest in developing them on the shallow bank that runs right along the eastern coast of Ireland.  Various developers have looked at different sections of it over time.  Depending on where they would connect to the system, it could be quite beneficial as most of the demand on the electricity system is on the east coast, as distinct from the west coast.<br\/><br\/>As for our interest in developing interconnectors, or even going a step further with grids on the Irish Sea, we started off in 2009 when the east-west interconnector was well under way.  We saw an opportunity to go again to the United Kingdom, but that would have been a third interconnector to the United Kingdom, or to France.  The French case at the time presented more economic benefits for consumers.  Momentum has built behind it, as we are more firm about the benefits it could deliver and have progressed in our relationship with R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE.  At the same time, several developers came on the scene looking to develop interconnectors between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  To some extent, the development space was being dealt with by these developers.  At one time, there were three separate proposals to build additional connectors on top of the existing two between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Only one of them remains a viable project.  We are also talking to our European colleagues about how we can connect up disparate sets of offshore wind farms to a grid.  TenneT is developing the concept of an island, about which we are talking to it.  We are fortunate that many of the sites on the east coast are close enough to have an AC connection to the grid without the need to have large converter stations.  We have ended up where we are with a French interconnector as distinct from one to the United Kingdom because, at the time, it presented more benefits for consumers and the other space was occupied by other developers, one of which is still there.  Who should own them is a policy question, more than being one for us.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question was on Brexit and specifically the east-west electricity trade between the single electricity market, SEM, and the GB market.  I would like to differentiate between the negotiations as that word has a political context in the Article 50 space.  EirGrid and National Grid in the United Kingdom are very close.  We have two interconnectors which join our systems and regularly interact.  As we are changing the market here, we have extensive discussions with the National Grid on how the two markets will couple under the new arrangement.  With the integrated-single electricity market, I-SEM, and the market changes we are making here, we are in the process of engaging in detailed discussions with National Grid on how they will link up and how that trade will happen.  Obviously, there are conversations happening to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that it will be robust to deal with whatever the outcome may be of the Brexit negotiations in a member state or EU-sense.  We continue to work as closely as we can with National Grid, as two transmission system operators, TSOs, in two jurisdictions to ensure the trade in electricity between them will be as seamless as possible to benefit consumers as much as possible and robust to meet whatever the outcome is of the Brexit negotiations.  There are, however, no negotiations <i>per se<\/i>in the context of Article 50.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s third question was about the changing nature of demand forecasts.  We will get back with specific answers on terawatt hours in 2016.  Annually, we update our demand forecasts for the next ten years.  Only last week we published our new generation capacity statement with our forecast for demand to 2026.  We review, update and publish it on an annual basis.  The projections remain within the bounds of what we foresaw with this version of the grid development strategy.<br\/><br\/>Within tomorrow's energy scenarios which look further to 2040, obviously growth in demand is one of the key variables.  It ranges from growth in demand of 26% up to 60% across the different scenarios.  There is a significant range in the assumed growth in demand figures.  The other part is that there are assumptions where the growth in demand happens.  It could manifest itself at transmission level or in a proliferation of generation at residential and domestic level.  In our consumer action scenario we actually see the level of demand drop on the transmission system, while the gross level of demand in the economy increases because it is served by small micro residential generation systems at a domestic level.<\/p><p>The Deputy's point on the importance of demand forecast within the range is well made.  We have covered it in the scenarios.  <\/p><p> The Deputy referred to data centres.  Data centres are very significant in terms of demand growth and in our energy scenarios about 75% of the demand growth we see is driven by the assumption of the build-out of data centres.  It is the key driver.  We see increasing levels of energy efficiency mitigate some of the growth that happens as economic growth happens.  Data centres are the outlier in that and we see them contributing 75% of the demand growth across the different scenarios.  We have looked at that.  I apologise for not having to hand the number the Deputy wanted.  We will get it for him.  <\/p><p> Deputy Stanley's first question was on renewables.  I spoke a little bit about offshore wind.  We are seeing a set of auction results around Europe which would lead us to believe it is becoming a very competitive technology.  There is a need, when we look at the auction results, to make sure we are comparing apples with apples.  Some of them contain provisions that the developer is provided with the transmission connection, which can be quite expensive, or with a fully consented site.  Notwithstanding that, there is a resurgent interest in it in Europe and it is winning in some of those competitive auctions.  It will always be more expensive than on-shore wind for obvious reasons but the changing technology of much bigger turbines is coming.  The Deputy asked how the grid is prepared to accept some of it from off-shore technologies.  Off-shore wind is only one off-shore technology but it is probably the only one that is commercial.  The other, such as tidal and wave energy are much further away in terms of being commercially viable.  The answer to the question about how prepared the grid is depends on where the connection to the grid is.  If it was to develop down the east coast where there are some good sea areas for developing off-shore, we are potentially connecting into relatively strong points on the grid and also closer to where the demand is.  Depending on where it is, it might be quite beneficial for the network.  <\/p><p> The Deputy's second point on renewables was on micro-generation.  The Deputy makes the point that in some other European countries there is significantly more of it than here and that is true.  In places such as Germany there has been an explosion in roof-top solar energy.  In the south east of England there has also been a huge amount of distributed solar energy installed.  It has also come on in Spain.  In those countries such micro-generation has primarily come from roof-top solar on commercial buildings or houses driven largely by very generous subsidy regimes which in some cases the policy makers have had to pull back from.  There is significantly more of it in some European countries than there is here.  As we look out to 2030 and 2040 through our energy scenarios, we see the potential for it to become more a part of the mix.  The core part of our consumer action scenario is concerned with consumers becoming more engaged with their energy future or energy system and deploying those technologies at a local, community or household level.  We will examine that scenario to see what it means for the transmission system, security of supply and distribution network.  The scenarios enable us to work through the implications for a range of things, not least policy targets, if that is what the future looks like.    <\/p><p> The Deputy had a specific question about the replacement of coal.  Moneypoint is the only coal burning station.  The decision about what to do with Moneypoint rests with the ESB.  In three of our four scenarios we have assumed that by 2030 coal will be replaced.  In one of them, we have not.  By virtue of the fact there is one in which coal remains, we will be able to see the with-coal and without-coal effect when we look at the implications of those scenarios going forward.  In so far as it affects the rest of the energy system and the rest of the network, we have sought to take it into account.  The specifics of any investment decision to change the use of Moneypoint would be for the ESB.  <\/p><p> The Deputy's second question was on the North-South interconnector.  We would love to be able to talk about the North-South interconnector.  We have been at this committee and discussed the North-South interconnector and other projects before but it is before the High Court.  There are three judicial reviews under way and there is a hearing tomorrow in the High Court on it.  I am constrained in what I can say.  On the ALEGrO project in Germany, which the Deputy mentioned, my understanding is the applicability of it or not would come within the scope of the independent review the Minister launched today or yesterday to update the previous review on technologies and the international experience.  I expect the international review to look at the ALEGrO project and others around Europe to ascertain if there are any lessons that can be learned or applicability to the situation in Ireland.  <\/p><p> I am happy to come back and discuss the North-South interconnector at length with the committee once the judicial review proceedings are dispensed with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>It is understandable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494352800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Deputy's final question was on the Celtic interconnector and its funding and whether there was a commitment by Europe to fund it.

Of the total money spent to date, we have applied to the Connecting Europe Facility and have received funding up to 50% which is typically the maximum it will give out.  We hope when we make an application for the full project it will be looked upon favourably and will get similar treatment.  We will only know that when we make the application which we expect to make in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked the share of the cost between Ireland and France.  To date, we and RTE have operated on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis.  After taking into account moneys received from the Connecting Europe Facility, the remaining costs have been split 50-50 between us and RTE.  As part of the investigative work we are looking at now, we are working with the regulators to set out the benefits the project will deliver in monetary terms between Ireland and France.  It will inform a decision by the regulators probably towards the end of next year on what the appropriate cost sharing between the two jurisdictions is.  There is a formal European process determining how cost-sharing between two jurisdictions pursuing a project such as this is done.  In the first instance, it is the two regulators.  We and RTE make a submission to the regulators.  We expect it will happen in the middle of next year and that they will come back with a decision towards the end of next year on the cost sharing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>In the context of Brexit, it is a very good development that it is being pursued.

I have a number of questions, some of which may have already been covered by previous speakers.  The Celtic interconnector is to be commissioned and in place by 2025.  What is the timeline for this?  What is the split between Ireland, France and the EU with regard to cost funding?  Who will pay for it and to what degree?  Will there be a two way flow?  Will we contribute to the EU and France and will France contribute to us?  Will we buy or sell energy?  I wish to understand a little more about the logistics and the balance.<\/p><p>This is an area which puts Brexit in stark relief.  We can speak about very academic matters but when we look at a map and interconnectors, the physical geography jumps out at us and is very apparent.  I am delighted to see progress on the Celtic interconnector.  Nobody can anticipate or predict the constitutional relationships across these islands in future.  I was at a conference where this was discussed.  There may be a possibility of going to or through Scotland as an alternative land bridge.  Who knows where any of these countries may be post-Brexit in the long-term constitutional landscape?  Has anything been looked at in this regard or have there been exploratory talks?<\/p><p>What are we doing to strike deals with the UK as it is with regard to existing interconnectors?  I understand there was a period of downtime on the interconnector across the Irish Sea.  How long was it out for?  What was the outage caused by?  What was the cost to restore it?  What were the implications?  Obviously we took over because the lights stayed on.  What happened while it was down?  What were the exposures?  What are the operational risks of such a project?  What energy security risks are posed?<\/p><p>We have a nod to energy mix in the chart with regard to renewable energy evolution and aspirations.  With regard to solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, tidal and biomass we are quite poor with regard to renewable component in our energy mix <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other European states.  This is something we all hope to see us drive towards.  Do the witnesses have a view on where we need to be, where we should be and where we can get you in the medium term?<\/p><p>My next question may be a little out of the box.  With regard to infrastructure, connectivity and the connections we have throughout the island, the committee has discussed at length broadband and Internet connectivity.  What, if any, potential exists for using existing power infrastructure for telecoms purposes, primarily rural broadband and broadband enablement?  If we have the kit out there perhaps there is a possibility engineering-wise to use some of it.  I am interested to hear the thoughts and comments of the witnesses on this possibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017050900002#F00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1494352800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for coming and for the statement they made and the material they have produced.

Beside the graph is written that data centre connections would reach 1,950 MVA in 2030 and most of these would be based in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  There is a series of data centre applications in the pipeline, as I understand it, and under consideration.  It seems that whatever view one takes, a large data centre can account for 6% to 8% of current electrical output as things stand.  Who is actually deciding that Ireland needs extra data centres?  Who is deciding we should have 20, ten or five data centres?  Is EirGrid involved in a collaborative strategic plan with IDA Ireland?  Does IDA Ireland want more data centres?  As I understand data centres, a venture with 150 jobs, which may require a substantial investment of &euro;1 billion, and require an increase of 6% to 8% of our electricity generation.  Is this a price we want to pay for 150 jobs?  If somebody said he or she had a plan to build a shoe factory, which will chew up 8% of electricity and asked for a grant, people might say it would have huge implications for data centres.<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, nobody has actually evolved a policy on this.  I do not understand whether Ireland wants to have 20 or three extra data centres or five large data centres, but the implications for our national demand are colossal.  EirGrid is a  service organisation.  It looks at inputs coming in from elsewhere, one of which is demand by data centres for power supply.  Who decides, in terms of Ireland meeting its environmental targets for electricity consumption, the fundamental strategic decisions as EirGrid understands it?<\/p> <p>  Suppose I am a company such as Google, and I say I want to increase Irish data centres by building something massive, which will increase Irish electricity generation demand by 8%, who says to me it is not a very good idea and asks how it will be accommodated in our overall national strategy?  There does not seem to be anybody who is taking responsibility and saying this is a sustainable plan, this number of data centres is something we can accommodate if we have rapid economic growth, and if we have all of these data centres we will have a massive demand and increase for electricity.  The way I see it, nobody is stating he or she is making the decision for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The reason I mention this is I believe Ireland has natural advantages as a data centre location.  Our climate means it is cheaper to cool data centres, our geography means we are less likely to suffer an earthquake or landslide or be snowed in.  We are attractive from this point of view.  The real question is what is the attraction for us.  If we look at EirGrid and the electricity producers, this is extra market, but what is the attraction?  Do we have a plan as to how much of this market we want to locate in Ireland?  It seems the employment advantages are fairly small but the energy and sustainable energy implications are very large.  Nobody has ever been able to explain to me who is calling the shots on this.  Does IDA Ireland, the Government, EirGrid or the electricity producers have a plan or is it a case of let us see what comes in, we will try to accommodate it, we will not make any strategic decisions, and then, in the planning process, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all of the rest will just have to pick up the pieces?

In line with our own assumptions, the report states that 75% of demand growth up to 2030 and 2040 will be driven by data centres.  We work with all the data centres on where they can connect.  They pay for their connection in line with the charging process and also pay for any energy they use so they are not free riding on the system.  They are having a significant effect on projections for demand growth.  We work very closely with the IDA to look at strategic sites which would be appropriate for data centres to connect.
