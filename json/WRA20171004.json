The Report is also available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  Key measures among the 40 actions contained in the Taskforce Report included measures to streamline and prioritise planning procedures for telecoms infrastructure, a licensing regime to allow people to boost their home signals using repeaters, the build out of new ducting along the M7 \/ M8, measures to help stakeholders make informed choices in relation to their network provider and handsets, and general network improvements.<\/p>  <p>  To maintain momentum, I established an Implementation Group together to drive progress on implementing the measures recommended by the Taskforce. The establishment of the Implementation Group is a commitment in the Action Plan for Rural Development. I co-chair the Implementation Group with Minister of State Sean Kyne.<\/p>  <p>  The Group comprises key stakeholders identified in the Taskforce report with responsibility for delivery of actions. Officials in both Departments are working closely together to oversee delivery of the actions.<\/p>  <p>  The membership comprises the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association. ComReg, the independent Regulator for the telecommunications sector, also sits on the Group in an advisory role and also in respect of its ownership of a number of key actions.\u00a0 This key stakeholder interaction will ensure that strong momentum and timely delivery is maintained over the coming months, and will enable early identification and proactive management of any emerging challenges to the delivery of actions. In addition to overseeing the delivery of actions by the State entities, the Group will monitor and track progress made on actions owned by telecommunications operators. Quarterly progress reports are being produced and published on the status of Taskforce actions, the second quarterly report having been published in July 2017. The first two quarterly progress reports are accessible on the DCCAE website. These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry. In addition, a comprehensive Annual Review of progress will be undertaken at the end of 2017.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>\u00a0A National Stakeholder Forum will also be held on Friday 6 October 2017 in Athlone, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable\u00a0discussion on all the\u00a0issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure. This work will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Forum will be hosted by me and by Minster Kyne, and it will feature a range of stakeholders from across the telecoms sector, including action owners, Government Departments, the independent Regulator, industry representatives, as well as consumer representatives.

The new\u00a0RESS is being designed\u00a0to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets\u00a0out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.

I welcome the efforts, as I am sure all Deputies do, that the compliant industry has made by joining the new scheme and working together to ensure that waste tyres do not continue to be a blight on our countryside. <\/p>  <p>  A new compliance scheme for tyres will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited (PRL).  The scheme will carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members and will be funded by a visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC).  Currently the EU single market facilitates cross border trade.  Fees for the collection and management of waste tyres have previously been charged, but this has not always been transparent or effective, as suggested by the level of tyres being dumped around the country.\u00a0 The flow of tyres from one jurisdiction to another has more to do with currency fluctuations than making an environmental cost on a tyre more visible.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of the concerns of the tyre industry regarding the new structures.  I have met with the tyre representative bodies. I listened to their concerns and I have done my best to address as many of them as possible.  I have also received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support the compliant majority of the tyre industry, the new structures will be supported by a strong enforcement regime, which will be a priority for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs).  In addition, the EPA has a new enforcement role to ensure producers register with PRL and provide all relevant data.  Tyres are one of the five priority areas for enforcement in 2017, as agreed by the National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee, and I have made &euro;9 million available this year in relation to waste enforcement. I will be asking the EPA and Local Authorities to begin a visible enforcement campaign on tyres, particularly in border areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[41900\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the procurement status of the national broadband plan; the date by which every premises in the country will have access to broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>As I\u00a0indicated in my responses to\u00a0questions higher up on\u00a0today's order paper, last week the procurement process being managed\u00a0by my Department reached a key milestone with the receipt of \"Detailed Submissions\".\u00a0 Two submissions were received from Eircom Limited and the Granahan McCourt, enet, SSE, John Laing Group plc consortium.\u00a0 As the House is no doubt aware, SIRO formally communicated its withdrawal from the National Broadband Plan procurement process.\u00a0 SIRO remains strongly committed to its planned\u00a0investment of\u00a0&euro;450m to provide\u00a0fibre broadband in\u00a051 towns across Ireland on an open access basis.\u00a0As of the end of last week, some 100,000 premises have been passed by SIRO.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0NBP procurement process continues to be\u00a0a competitive process, with\u00a0two strong operators in the telecommunications field.\u00a0 The procurement process has\u00a0now entered its final stages and as I've indicated to the House today, I expect that Final Tenders will be\u00a0invited\u00a0in\u00a0early 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA02050"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[41960\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of times he has met with the officials of a company (details supplied) since the signing of the agreement to provide 300,000 homes with broadband outside of the scope of the national broadband plan; the dates he met with the company; the officials which were present; and the nature of discussions.","asker":"1276","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed a\u00a0agreement with me committing it to follow through on\u00a0its\u00a0commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.<\/p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I\u00a0established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  To maintain momentum, I\u00a0established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This group will report on progress every 90 days.  The Implementation Group has met twice this year, in March and July, and is due to meet again in October.  Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which\u00a0are available on my Department's website.  These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.<\/p>  <p>  A stakeholder forum is planned for later this month, to be held in Athlone, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable\u00a0discussion on all the\u00a0issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.

The Plan identifies over 70 mitigation measures and 106 related actions to address the immediate challenge to 2020 and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.\u00a0Although the Plan\u00a0does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  There is no doubt that delivery\u00a0of the\u00a0measures in the National Mitigation\u00a0Plan will, in many cases,\u00a0require significant investment. However, decisions on the funding of\u00a0particular measures will be a matter for Government consideration in the context of expenditure planning in the Estimates and Budgetary processes, including decisions on capital expenditure following the mid-term review of the current Capital Plan and in the forthcoming National Investment Plan for 2018-2027.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  Where relevant, the National Mitigation Plan already includes information on the expected Exchequer cost of implementing individual measures, either in the context of direct expenditure or in relation to tax foregone. The actual expenditure on a given measure will depend on progress in implementation of each measure, including its possible expansion as a result of additional funding, for which the relevant sectoral Minister retains direct responsibility.\u00a0I, and other sectoral Ministers with a role in the National Mitigation Plan, continue to engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Budget and Estimates process with a view to ensuring that the investment requirements arising from the National Mitigation Plan are appropriately reflected in Budget 2018.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  In addition to measures in place, the National Mitigation Plan includes measures under consideration by Government.

Similarly, it does not yet provide a complete roadmap to meeting Ireland's expected targets between 2021 and 2030 under the draft EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Instead,\u00a0the Plan will be subject to formal review at least once every five years and will also become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.\u00a0 This\u00a0continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of\u00a0emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable electricity technologies, at various scales, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland. Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken. International best practice has been examined, and the most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>Examples of some of these policies include a mandatory requirement for all renewable electricity projects seeking financial support through the new scheme to offer investment and\/or ownership opportunities to the local community; the facilitation of grid access for community-led projects; a ring fencing of capacity (MW) for community-led projects; and the establishment of a national community benefits register. Furthermore, the Scheme will establish a network of trusted intermediaries who will act as\u00a0independent facilitators between communities and developers to support community participation in renewable energy projects.<\/p>  <p>  These recommendations could have a profound effect, boosting community ownership of and involvement in the renewable energy transition in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Micro generation,\u00a0including the use of solar PV panels on domestic rooftops, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before the introduction of a tariff for exported electricity from solar PV rooftop installations. These include amongst others, a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to finding an appropriate mechanism for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role\u00a0in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy,\u00a0in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country. I have asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to facilitate a workshop on micro generation, and this will take place later this month.\u00a0All relevant stakeholders will be invited to participate with the end goal being the development of a policy position on how best to support micro generation in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September\u00a0and submissions are invited from the public. All submissions will be considered and following on from this final public consultation, a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval.

These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 Megabits\u00a0per second when the procurement process for the State led intervention is completed\u00a0and the network rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":64,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Mitigation Plan","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA04150"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[41906\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400069#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the national mitigation plan will be discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017 was an important\u00a0initial step to enable the transition to a low carbon economy and society.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005. This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.<\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020. The\u00a0projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0The\u00a0Plan sets out what Ireland is currently doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.

Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018. However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances. While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":133,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered with Question No. 47.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":134,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":135,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04450"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[41962\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason areas of the national broadband map are blue in areas of the country that denote rivers and forests indicating they are supported by companies yet the houses next to the blue areas are amber and are not supported by broadband such as in Cloyne, County Cork.","asker":"1276","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that all premises, regardless of location, are targeted to receive broadband under the National Broadband Plan.\u00a0The high speed broadband Map, which can be accessed on my Department's at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows all premises to be covered under the Plan, which include State Intervention and commercial investment.<\/p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded Amber for areas to be covered by the State rollout and Blue\u00a0for areas where commercial operators are delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.\u00a0\u00a0Light Blue areas on the\u00a0Map\u00a0include homes and businesses to be served under\u00a0eir's rural planned deployment broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018.\u00a0 By necessity, the map will include the\u00a0geographical spread of\u00a0Ireland - townlands, rivers, lakes etc.\u00a0\u00a0The townland of Townparks,\u00a0(ed Cloyne)\u00a0comprise a mix of premises to be covered by either commercial or state led intervention\u00a0and are colour coded accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences Approvals","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04650"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[41837\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will refrain from issuing future licences for oil or gas exploration in view of the State's commitments under the Paris treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emissions fuels, e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy. In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. In 2015,\u00a0over 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was generated from renewable energy sources.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland sources all its oil needs from abroad. In addition, Ireland currently sources its gas supply from the Kinsale gasfields, the Corrib gasfield and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland. Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future. The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021 while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Taking this into account, successful exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s Offshore has the potential to deliver benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and reduced fossil fuel imports, as we transition to a low carbon future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seanad Reform","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04850"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[41721\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400070#WRB04900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his plans for Seanad reform.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government stated its commitment to pursuing the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Seanad Reform (the Manning Report).<\/p><p>That Report was published in 2015 and it is available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of the Report was the establishment of an Implementation Group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the Report.<\/p><p>As my predecessor previously said in the House, he agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Martin that this Group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.

It is hoped that a final report will be published during the autumn\/winter term.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the implementation of these reports will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.\u00a0 I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in motor insurance pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for August) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14% year-on-year. \u00a0While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases. \u00a0I am hopeful however that greater stability in pricing will continue to occur, and that premiums will continue to fall from the very high levels of last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400071#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Submissions","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400071#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[42099\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400071#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will examine a request by an organisation (details supplied); his plans regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>My Department has so far received in the order of 370 Pre-Budget Submissions from a wide range of groups and individuals.

This follows on from the identification of a number of issues in respect of the compliance by a number of schools constructed by WBS with their fire safety certificates.  My Department, at this stage, does not have any reason to believe that there are any fire safety issues in respect of any of the other buildings built by Western Building Systems.  These audits are a proactive measure being taken, following on from consultation with stakeholders, to satisfy the Department that there are no further issues with school buildings constructed by that company.\u00a0 It is anticipated that this will take approximately 6 months to complete this number of audits.\u00a0 However, in each case, the Department will require an early report from the Fire Safety Consultants conducting the audit if any issue of significant concern is discovered.<\/p><p>Further to this and as previously announced, my Department is in the process of commissioning fire safety audits of a representative sample of up to 25 schools constructed over the last 20 years.  It should be noted that each school building is already required to have and comply with a fire certificate awarded at time of construction by the local authority.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the selection of a school to be included in the sample for this audit in no way means that my Department has concerns about that particular school.\u00a0 Regarding the timeline for this sample audit, it is expected to be concluded by January 2018. The tender for the appointment of fire safety consultants will be completed by the mid October.  It is expected that the first set of Fire Safety Audit Reports will be provided to my Department by the end of December 2017.<\/p><p>My Department will also contact the representative Professional Associations, principally the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland ((RIAI), Engineer&rsquo;s Ireland (IEI) and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland (ACEI) to discuss the operation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations (2014) to re-iterate the responsibilities of Design Teams to fully engage in a complete and comprehensive way with the inspection and certification requirements of BC(A)R (2014). \u00a0It is the responsibility of the Design Team appointed to build a school to ensure that a newly constructed building is compliant with it&rsquo;s Fire Certificate.  My Department is writing to these associations to remind them of their members<b>&rsquo;<\/b>legal duties in this regard.<\/p><p>My Department has also written to all Design Teams working on buildings currently under construction to remind them of their responsibilities to ensure that all buildings comply with fire certificates awarded by the local authority<\/p><p>My Department will also issue a new Circular to all schools bringing the attention of the school authorities to their obligations in relation to Fire Safety management protocols. Detailed guidance documents are already in place to advice schools on managing Health and Safety in schools that includes comprehensive advice on the issue of managing the risk of fire.<\/p><p>My Department will, going forward, appoint a Clerk of Works to all future major building projects to enhance the oversight and inspection of works when they are being carried out.  This person, who will be appointed by the Department of Education and Skills, will provide an extra layer of checking and oversight during the construction process.<\/p><p>Additionally, an internal fire safety committee is being established within my Department.  This group will be made up of both technical and administrative staff, and will monitor any patterns arising from day to day interactions with schools, the results from the various audits and their own recent experience to shape any further action in this regard.<\/p><p>Finally, under a new protocol from now on, when my Department receives a fire audit report which demonstrates issues in a building regarding fire safety, my Department will immediately notify the school&rsquo;s Patron Body, the school&rsquo;s Board of Management and the Fire Officer in the relevant Local Authority.<\/p><p>These audits and actions will inform any further action which may be required by my Department to ensure that they are satisfied with the fire safety measures in place to protect schools.<\/p><p>My Department will contact the Chief Fire Officers Association to inform them of the above steps which are being taken.  A new protocol will also be put in place to keep them up to date with any further developments in this area.<\/p><p>It is worth noting again that my Department has no reason to believe that there are issues with fire safety provisions in schools generally.  These additional steps are an added precaution being taken by the Department, prompted by recent concerns in Ireland and abroad regarding fire safety in public buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[42080\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the capitation grant to primary schools will be increased to bring it in line with that provided to post-primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I recognise the need to improve capitation funding for primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to make precise comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post-primary levels.\u00a0 However it is self-evident that the maintenance and running costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  In general,\u00a0post-primary schools are larger than primary schools and have a lower pupil teacher ratio resulting in more classrooms and specialist rooms such as laboratories, workshops and kitchens.\u00a0 This leads to higher unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019 which include restoring capitation funding as resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.\u00a0 The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016 and &euro;5 in 2017 in order to enable primary schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Capitation funding remains a priority for me to address during the lifetime of the Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil Data Collection","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[42120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children in primary schools in the Navan school catchment area; the number of secondary school places that exist in the town; and the planned numbers in both sectors for each of the next five years.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>For school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 geographic areas known as school planning areas which\u00a0facilitates the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.\u00a0<\/p><p>In the Navan school planning area, there are 20 primary schools with a total enrolment for the 2016\/17 school year of 6,184 primary pupils and\u00a05 post-primary schools\u00a0with a total enrolment for the 2016\/17 school year of 3,385 post-primary students.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.

The Authority submitted its report following these consultations on 29 September 2017 which is in the course of being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also wish to note that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority submitted its first Annual Report under the Act on 26 April 2017 which was duly laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 18 May 2016.\u00a0 The Authority also makes such reports available, as appropriate and when laid before the Houses, on its website.<\/p><p>Having delivered\u00a0these key reporting obligations the current working focus is very much on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions with the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources which are essential to effective delivery.  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers, will be commenced. Members of the public will no longer make complaints about alleged professional misconduct by legal practitioners through the legal professional bodies as happens at present, but rather through the independent Regulatory Authority. <\/p><p>In a key development the Authority has,\u00a0this summer, completed its public recruitment and appointment of a full-time Chief Executive.  It has also recently\u00a0secured larger\u00a0office premises in support of the coming into operation of its respective functions.  This will also facilitate the Authority in\u00a0appointing and determining the duties of\u00a0further staff\u00a0under sections 25 and 26 of the 2015 Act\u00a0with the relevant approvals of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As with earlier commencements made under the 2015 Act, Statutory Instruments will issue as appropriate to the relevant sections or Parts of the Act concerned.<\/p><p>I and my Department continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity.\u00a0 The phased start-up of its various functions will continue to need careful project management.  It will also require the ongoing identification, in conjunction with the Authority, of the more specific delivery dates for the respective independent functions involved during the remainder of this year and into 2018.  These are matters in relation to which I expect greater detail to become available soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Subsidiary Protection Applications Data","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[42043\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons waiting for a first instance decision on a protection application from the International Protection Office; the average amount of time it is taking to get a first instance decision on a protection application from the office; the average amount of time to get an oral interview after lodging a protection application with the office; the number of refugee, subsidiary protection and permission to remain applications granted since 1 January 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced on 31 December 2016 (commencement date).  The 2015 Act introduced a single procedure which enables all grounds for seeking international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) or permission to remain in the State for other reasons to be examined and determined in one process. <\/p><p>At the end of September 2017, there were some 4,950 applications awaiting processing in the International Protection Office (IPO).  The vast majority of these applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  These applications must be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act. Various categories of cases reverted to the IPO including asylum appeals transferred from the old Refugee Appeals Tribunal and asylum and subsidiary protection cases transferred from the old ORAC.  This added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload.<\/p><p>In terms of processing, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable progress has been made by the IPO in getting the new single procedure process up and running.  This follows IPO staff concentrating in the initial months of the year on the necessary preparatory work including issuing correspondence to all transitional applicants with details of the new processing arrangements, the handling of some 2,600 returned Application for International Protection Questionnaires including the translation of questionnaires (some 50% of which require translation) and the scheduling of interviews etc.  Furthermore, extensive training on the new procedures and processing arrangements has been delivered to staff in the IPO and supporting panel members (persons with legal qualifications who support International Protection Officers in their function.<\/p><p>To date, the IPO has also conducted almost 1,900 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU Relocation cases) and 69 interviews under the 2013 Subsidiary Protection Regulations.  More than 160 additional interviews have been scheduled in the IPO for the coming weeks with more interviews being scheduled on a daily basis.<\/p><p>A total of 463 grants for protection have issued this year to 19<sup>th<\/sup>September, comprising 325 granted refugee status under the Single Procedure and a further 69 legacy applicants were granted refugee status under the Refugee Act, 1996.  In addition, 54 grants of Subsidiary Protection under the legacy procedures were made.\u00a0 A further 15 humanitarian permissions to remain were granted by the International Protection Office.<\/p><p>At the present time, it is not possible to calculate an accurate current median processing time for international protection applications due to the different case types on hands which were returned to the IPO under the transition provisions in the 2015 Act. Considerable additional resources, have and are, being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible.<\/p><p>In relation to the scheduling of interviews and the processing of cases in the IPO, I am also advised that the prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency. When the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors.  The IPO&rsquo;s approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR and is available on its website:<i>www.ipo.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Poor Box","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[42063\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400072#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will report on the use of the court poor box for penalty point offences in view of the fact that it is still happening in some courts despite a High Court ruling in February 2014 against the practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>The court poor box is a non-statutory system used by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The latest projections\u00a0for greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The\u00a0projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. <\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400075#WRG04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobile Telephony Services","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400075#WRG04500"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[42183\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400075#WRG04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the degree to which he directly or through the medium of ComReg influences the quality and coverage for mobile phones with particular reference to his own experience in these issues in view of the need to achieve an even and reliable quality of service in all areas throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[42184\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400075#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has had discussions with ComReg or service providers with a view to improving the quality and availability of the mobile telephone service throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone and broadband services, is a matter for the service providers concerned which operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations. The regulation of telecommunications service providers generally, including allocating radio spectrum for mobile telephone services, the imposition of binding conditions and regulatory issues surrounding mobile phone network coverage and quality, in accordance with procurement or licensing conditions, are functions of ComReg.<\/p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I\u00a0established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland. To maintain momentum, I\u00a0established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This group will report on progress every 90 days. The Implementation Group has met twice this year, in March and July, and is due to meet again in October. Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which\u00a0are available on my Department's website. These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 27.1% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.0% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2016.\u00a0Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources.\u00a0While good progress is being made,\u00a0meeting our 2020 targets will be challenging.<\/p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 3,400 MW approximately, of which 3,080 MW is wind generation. It is estimated that a total of between 3,900 MW and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Given that we have 3,400 MW in place, we will need approximately a further\u00a0500 MW to\u00a0900 MW of additional renewable generation to meet our 2020 targets.\u00a0<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place\u00a0 or under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector.

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.\u00a0 SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. <\/p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months and tendering to\u00a0engage\u00a0consultants to carry out that\u00a0process is currently underway.\u00a0 In\u00a0light of the\u00a0SEA requirements, it is expected that the\u00a0Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until  2018.\u00a0 In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.<\/p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.\u00a0 Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.<\/p><p>In relation to solar farms, there are no specific planning guidelines in place. Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.<\/p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.

Both the employers and employees make PRSI contributions. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension is viewed as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The combined benefit from both sources &ndash; the occupational pension plus the State Pension &ndash; makes up the person&rsquo;s &lsquo;total pension&rsquo;.  On that basis, the employees&rsquo; occupational pensions are subject to a process &ndash; known as &ldquo;integration&rdquo; &ndash; whereby the occupational pension arrangements take account of entitlement to Social Insurance benefits (including the State Pension). <\/p>  <p>  Integration is a standard feature of public service pension schemes applicable to employees in full PRSI class who, whether joining the public service before or since April 1995, were subject to full PRSI. Integration does not apply to retirement gratuities.  Integration begins from the time the occupational pension comes into payment and operates on the assumption that a Social Insurance benefit is, in fact, payable.  However, except in cases of ill-health early retirement, Social Insurance benefits may actually not be payable until age 66 to 68 (depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth).  Under standard public service pension scheme arrangements for those who joined the public service before 1 January 2013 in full PRSI class, a &lsquo;supplementary pension&rsquo; may be payable in certain circumstances on compulsory retirement prior to State Pension age (66\/68) in order to make up the shortfall in total pension in the interim. <\/p>  <p>  This supplementary pension is not payable automatically once a person reaches compulsory retirement age &ndash; such as age 60\/65 in the wider public service &ndash; or some years earlier in the case of military personnel. Rather, the supplementary pension is payable only during periods in which the pensioner is (a) not in insurable employment; and (b) due to causes outside his or her control, fails to qualify for Social Welfare benefit \/ pension (or qualifies at a rate less than the maximum personal rate of State Pension).  The pensioner must meet these qualifying criteria to qualify for payment.  Therefore, the supplementary pension is not payable where a &lsquo;pre-January 2013&rsquo; public service pensioner is, subsequent to compulsory retirement &ndash; for example at age 58, 60 or 65 &ndash; working or employed in any capacity that involves a Social Insurance contribution.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated to the House in my replies to Question No. 51 on 11 July 2017 and Question No. 2106 on 11 September 2017, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme was one of the key structural fiscal reform commitments agreed by Government with the EU\/IMF in 2010 under the programme of financial support for Ireland.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the Single Scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the longer-term through far-reaching transformation and reform of the public service pension system.  It provides for a new approach which modernises and standardises pension arrangements throughout the public service.  The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to the superannuation arrangements of all public servants recruited before 1 January 2013 &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.  This position has been confirmed to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations.<\/p>  <p>  However, the absence of any provision for the supplementary pension concept in the Single Scheme must be viewed in the overall context of the fundamental changes and reforms to the pension scheme terms of post-2013 new entrants.  Such reforms were decided by Government and the Oireachtas as necessary to support the long-term financial sustainability of the public service pension system.  In that context, there are many other established features of the pre-1 January 2013 public service occupational pension arrangements that have been discontinued, or that have been fundamentally changed, under the Single Scheme.  Among the most notable of these changes is the introduction of career-average pension accrual under the Single Scheme, in place of the more costly final salary pension accrual applicable in the earlier &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; public service pension schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK02100"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[42130\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of chemical risk assessments on record with the Air Corps group formation health and safety office.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>As this matter pertains to litigation which is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Training","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK02400"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[42131\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017100400078#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if chemical health and safety training is provided to new recruits and cadets as part of their basic training; and if not, if it will be made mandatory as soon as possible.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>I am advised by the relevant military authorities that basic Health and Safety training is provided to all new entrants to the Defence Forces.\u00a0 Where a requirement for more specific Health and Safety training is identified for an individual or group of individuals for their post, this training is provided by qualified Defence Force safety personnel.
