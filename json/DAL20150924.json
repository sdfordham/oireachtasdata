This tax relief relates to donations to approved bodies of heritage items that are considered outstanding examples of their type and whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland.  Under this scheme, 80% of the market value of the items donated is offset against the current tax liability of the donor.  A selection committee chaired by my Department is currently considering a proposed donation of one of the Beit paintings under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I met again with representatives of the Alfred Beit Foundation at the end of July.  A number of issues were discussed, including issues regarding taxation and other assistance which the State could offer.   At my request, my officials have engaged with relevant Departments and State agencies to consider how best Russborough House could be assisted on a long-term basis.

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, responded to me to say that it is not his intention to amend the tax relief, noting the fact that 80% of the market value in tax relief is already very generous and that the rate was introduced to ensure there was some philanthropic aspect to donations.  Providing tax relief at a rate of 100% on the value of an item would have the exact same impact on the Exchequer finances as if the State were to purchase the item outright.

I note that something in excess of 1 million people have visited Russborough House since 1978.  That does not seem to be an inordinately high number of visitors.  The location of Russborough House in the garden of Ireland is quite phenomenal and one would assume that if properly packaged and more effectively marketed by being given the resources by the State, and I am not blaming the foundation for the difficulty, this venue could be far more attractive.

This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on 36 natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017, including parts of seven sites, and the de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas, including parts of seven sites.

However, because of recruitment and resource concerns, temporary derogations were put in place to cover the periods 2007-11 and 2012-16.  A unanimous decision by the Council of the EU is required on whether to end, amend or extend the derogation from 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Government places major importance on Irish becoming a full working language of the EU institutions and is committed to ending the derogation.  The Government, however, is also conscious of concerns about the recruitment of sufficient numbers of Irish language translators, lawyer linguists and translation assistants, and the associated resource implications during a period of adjustment by the EU institutions.  It is in this context that the Government is seeking agreement at the Council of the European Union for a Council regulation extending the derogation for another five years, with a view to the derogation ending on 31 December 2021.  An incremental approach to the provision of additional services is also being proposed so as to narrow the scope of the derogation in the interim. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this approach, the Government is also taking significant steps to create the circumstances in which a sufficient number of qualified graduates are in place to meet EU recruitment needs.

The overall objective of the programme is to bring forward necessary changes in order that the high quality and respected service the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided for almost a century is continued and enhanced to better meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing and to ensure the very important confidence of the public in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that significant progress has been made in the delivery of the reform programme, which is being overseen by the newly established Cabinet committee on justice reform.  We have had an independent selection process for the position of Garda Commissioner.  We have enhanced the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  A commission of investigation, being chaired by Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Higgins, has been established and is examining matters in the Cavan-Monaghan Garda division.  Its terms of reference are fully in line with what was recommended in the Guerin report.  The independent review mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel, has examined approximately 320 complaints and is progressing.  Comprehensive responses are going out to complainants and this is being overseen by Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy.  We now have the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, and the Freedom of Information Act 2014 extends to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda professional standards unit report on the operation of the fixed charge processing system, or penalty points, was published and Judge Matthew Deery, former President of the Circuit Court, has the new position of independent oversight authority for the fixed charge processing system.  It is fair to describe these changes as a sea change.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Garda Inspectorate published a comprehensive report on crime investigation which we are implementing.  This will not happen overnight, as the Garda Inspectorate itself stated.  It stated the report contains recommendations for the short, medium and longer term.  The Central Statistics Office has initiated a review of crime counting rules in order that the public can have confidence in the statistics published, which is very important.  A data quality team has been established in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have also had the reorganisation and amalgamation of Garda national units, including a new amalgamated drugs and organised crime bureau, which is important, and a new national child protection, domestic violence and human exploitation unit.<\/p><p>We have a criminal justice steering group to provide greater co-ordination between all bodies operating in the criminal justice system.  That was an important recommendation from the Toland report and we can see the need for it from other reports.  We have the establishment of a new Garda incident recording process, which was mentioned in the inspectorate report, and it needs to be implemented across the country.  We will also have a victim support office in every local Garda division, which will be an important new initiative, given that we have the victims directive, which must be signed this year.<\/p> <p> Reforms being introduced are not limited to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have also had the Toland report, which set out a series of reforms to be implemented in my Department over a two-year timeframe.  There is a departmental programme for change, which is also addressing issues most recently identified in the Fennelly report.  Many of these matters were originally identified in the Toland report.  We have initiated change in terms of the management board and daily interactions and briefings, as well as management instructions and the implementation of internal mobility transfers at assistant secretary level.<\/p> <p> I will not labour the point this morning, but Deputies are aware that I have focused on resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Templemore is open again and we will have another 150 recruits entering the college next month.  This is important so that garda&iacute; can be assigned or reassigned to communities across the country that need Garda resources.  I promised seamless ongoing recruitment and that is what this Government has delivered and intends to continue to deliver throughout 2016.  This ramped-up recruitment underscores the determination of the Government to deliver an effective and responsive police service to protect our communities, as community safety is critical.  I opened a conference this morning by launching the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders, IASIO, report and I stated that we must ensure that serious and serial offenders can be put in prison; equally, with first-time offenders, where there is a possibility of rehabilitation, we need to focus on those groups.  We have also seen civilianisation in Dublin Airport, which is progressing on schedule.  There is also investment in Garda vehicles, of which Deputies in this House are well aware, as well as the beginning of change in ICT matters, which I know must continue.  I hope that with the support of colleagues in the Government over the next few weeks, we will be able to move to the speedy implementation of the ICT strategy that resulted from the group I put together encompassing representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality and the information technology sections within the Government.<\/p> <p> The establishment of an independent policing authority is at the core of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme and represents the most far-reaching reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.  The authority will provide a new, independent and dedicated forum for the public oversight of policing services in Ireland.  It will also provide a new engine to drive reforms of the policing system and practices to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fit to address the ongoing and emerging challenges of modern policing.  It is quite a task for the new policing authority.<\/p> <p> The new authority will have extensive functions, outlined in the Bill, which are currently exercised by the Government or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In particular, these functions will be concerned with overseeing the governance, structures and performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the policing area.  The Bill before the House proposes that the authority will, in particular, have responsibility for the following tasks.  People should not underestimate the importance of these tasks and the radical change they represent.  The authority will oversee the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its policing functions under a broad range of headings, including nominating persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda Commissioner; appointing persons to the ranks of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner and removing them for reasons related to policing services; appointing persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff; determining Garda priorities for policing services; approving the three-year Garda strategy statement and the annual Garda policing plan; establishing a Garda code of ethics; and promoting and supporting the continuous improvement of policing in the State.  The Bill also enables the authority to request the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate to initiate an inspection or inquiry or to examine Garda practices or procedures.  That is an important responsibility that the authority will have an option to exercise.<\/p> <p> The legislation has been developed taking into account the outcome of an extensive process of consultation.  This included the Government consultation process in May 2014, a seminar hosted in Farmleigh and consideration by the justice committee, which I thank for its efforts.  The provisions of the Bill are generally in line with the general scheme, which was published in November 2014 and which was broadly welcomed by the joint committee in the course of its pre-legislative scrutiny.  The proposals have been prepared in very close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, taking full account of the requirements of the Constitution.  In this jurisdiction, we must take account of the Irish Constitution and our legislation must clearly reflect that.  In particular, consideration has been given to the fact that under Article 28, as interpreted by the courts, there are restrictions on the extent to which it is open to the Government to delegate important functions relating to the executive power of the State to another body.  In recognition of the constitutional position of the Executive relating to policing, the Bill provides that a number of authority functions will require the co-agreement of the Minister.  Overall, the proposals in the Bill are designed to strike the right balance between the exercise by the authority of effective and meaningful oversight of the policing functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the retention by Government of essential residual powers relating to policing.  There is no doubt we will have discussions on that, but I have tried very hard to strike the right balance between meeting the constitutional requirements, which are essential, and empowering the authority to be as strong as it can be.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the security issue.  National security is a vital function of the Government, and the Garda Commissioner will continue to account fully to the Minister and the Government on security matters.  The Bill, for the first time, contains a definition of security services.  The purpose of this definition is purely to determine which functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be overseen by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government rather than the policing authority.  It Is important to bear in mind that the Bill does not seek to confer any further security-related powers or functions on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The definition contains an exclusion, which has been welcomed, for lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.  The definition was carefully considered in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The definition encompasses, among other matters, functions linked to offences under existing Iegislation, including offences under the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, and also espionage and sabotage.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with the membership and chair of the new authority.  Following a process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service seeking expressions of interest, the Government has nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the chairperson designate of the authority.  I thank her for agreeing to take up the position, as she has had a very distinguished career in public service in Ireland.  She has the confidence of the public in her independent role as chair of the police authority, overseeing the development and progression of the work of the police authority.  I thank her again for assisting in the preparations for the establishment of the authority.  Deputies are aware that the selection process for the eight ordinary members of the authority is currently under way and is being progressed by the Public Appointments Service.  The intention is that the authority will, in line with a recommendation of the joint committee, operate in shadow format and will be able to commence its operations as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted in the House.<\/p> <p> I will now turn to the specific content of the Bill.  The Bill comprehensively amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 - the principal Act - to incorporate the authority into the existing Garda legislative framework.<\/p><p>To facilitate Deputies, I arranged in June for the circulation of an unofficial consolidation of the principal Act, which includes the amendments proposed in the Bill.  I hope this has been of assistance in understanding the proposed changes.<br\/><br\/>Part 1 of the Bill is the standard provision.  Section 4 contains a definition of security services.  It is important to provide clarity as to what &quot;security services&quot; comprehend.  As I have said, it does not expand the powers of the authority.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 of the Bill gives the authority a very significant role in the appointment and removal of senior Garda personnel.  Sections 8, 9 arid 12 of the Bill deal with this.  In particular, under sections 8 and 9, the Government will make appointments to the ranks of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner solely on the recommendation of the authority.  The Government will be obliged to accept the authority's recommendations but may, only in exceptional circumstances and for substantial and stated reasons, request the authority to nominate another person in respect of an appointment.  Under section 12, the Authority will make appointments to the ranks from Garda superintendent to Assistant Commissioner.  Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14 deal with removals.  While the Government will retain the power to remove the Garda Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, the authority will be able to recommend a removal from these positions on grounds relating to policing services.  The authority will also be able to remove an Assistant Garda Commissioner, chief superintendent or superintendent on grounds relating to policing services.  The Garda Commissioner will be required to obtain the consent of the Authority for the summary dismissal of a member of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na not above the rank of inspector.<br\/><br\/>Section 15 continues the current arrangements for the recruitment of reserve members, with a requirement for consultation with the authority rather than the Minister.  Section 16 requires the authority to publish, within 12 months of its establishment, a code of ethics for Garda members and civilian staff.  That is an important timeframe.  People would expect that to be there at present.  It is a big job to do in the first year.  Section 17 requires approval for the number of appointments of Garda civilian staff to be given by the authority. Also, the authority will directly appoint Garda civilian staff equivalent to or above the rank of chief superintendent.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 of the Bill sets out the roles that will be undertaken by the Minister, the authority and the Garda Commissioner.  There can be areas in which this is quite difficult to determine, but this was all subject to a great deal of discussion in the consultation, which was very helpful.  Under section 18, the authority will, subject to the prior approval of the Minister, determine. and from time to time revise, priorities and performance targets for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions in respect of policing services.  It also inserts a new section 20A into the 2005 Act to allow the Minister to set priorities and performance targets for security services.  Given the challenging international situation at present, for example ISIS and the range of security challenges that are currently being thrown up across Europe, it is very important that this is now in the 2005 Act.  Sections 19 and 20 make provision for the authority, with the consent of the Minister, to approve the three-year strategy statement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the annual Garda policing plan, respectively.<br\/><br\/>Sections 21 and 22 make provision for the three-year report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the management and deployment of Garda resources and the yearly report of the Garda professional standards unit, respectively, to be submitted by the Commissioner to the authority, rather than the Minister.  That is extremely important because the issue of the effective management and deployment of Garda resources is raised again and again.  We now have a police authority with a specific obligation to get reports on that and for the Commissioner to report to it.  The Garda Inspectorate identified the need to match deployment with crime trends, because these do change.  Crime can go down in one area and increase in another, and it is important to have a swift deployment of resources to deal effectively with what is happening in a particular area or with any change in a particular type of crime.  For example, there are mobile gangs targeting particular areas, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be able to deploy resources swiftly where they are needed.  This section gives the authority a role in examining how that is being done.  Clearly, that is linked to the development of an efficient and effective ICT system.<br\/><br\/> Section 24 modifies the functions of the Garda Commissioner, as set out in section 26 of the principal Act, to reflect the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and the authority in relation to policing services.  In particular, the Commissioner will be required to assist and co-operate with the authority in the performance of its functions.  Once the authority is up and running, later this year and early next year, a relationship will be developed over the following years between the Garda Commissioner and her staff and the new Garda authority.  It is not going to happen overnight, no more than the various reforms that have been recommended in the Garda Inspectorate report, but the framework is now there for this to develop, for responsibility and authority to rest with the Garda authority and for the Commissioner to report to it in the variety of ways I have outlined.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 provides a role for the authority in seeking the views of the public in respect of matters concerning policing services.  This authority is all about engaging effectively with communities and giving the public and communities an opportunity to give their priorities to the authority and to be part of policing.  We have seen this development in other countries and we already have it with local authorities and policing committees at present, but this is another aspect of community involvement.  Section 26 amends section 32 of the principal Act to facilitate the appointment by the Minister of an Assistant Garda Commissioner to perform the functions of the Garda Commissioner where the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner is not available.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 makes provision for amendments to sections 35, 36 and 38 of the principal Act to transfer to the authority the functions of the Minister in relation to joint policing committees, as I have just mentioned, and the establishment of CCTV schemes for the purpose of securing public order.  Many communities around the country want to see more CCTV schemes.  There is no doubt that they will be part of the fight against crime as we go forward, and the policing authority will have a role in that.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 contains amendments to sections 40, 41, 42, 44, 45 and 46 of the principal Act dealing with the accountability of the Garda Commissioner for the exercise of his or her functions.  In particular, the amendment to section 40, provided for by section 32 of the Bill, specifies that the Commissioner will report to the authority with regard to policing services, a key element of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Part 6, which contains amendments to various sections of the principal Act, provides a role for the authority in relation to the appointment and secondment of personnel between the Garda Sioch&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Part 7 inserts a new Part 2A into the principal Act to provide for the establishment of the authority, its membership and its functions.  I will summarise the key provisions involved.  Section 62C provides that the authority will comprise nine members, to be appointed by the Government.  The chairperson will be appointed directly by the Government and the other eight ordinary members will be appointed by the Government from a panel following the holding of a selection competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  Importantly, a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas agreeing to the appointments will be required.  We will have a debate in this House about the chair and the members of the authority.  It also makes provision for ordinary members designate of the authority to be the first ordinary members of the authority.<\/p><p>Within the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with the assistance of the chair designate, we have set up a group that is examining all the relevant issues around this transition because this, as I have said, is a significant change in the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is much work to be done on the transition issues that arise.<\/p> <p> Section 62G provides for the removal by the Government of a member from the authority following detailed and stringent procedures, including a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputies have made a point of emphasising how important it is that this House has a role in relation to the various issues that I have just discussed.  That brings another layer of accountability and public scrutiny in the D&aacute;il, first, into the appointments, and, second, to any changes that could take place.<\/p> <p> Section 62H sets out the functions of the authority and section 62J makes provision whereby not less than four meetings per annum between the authority and the Garda Commissioner can be open to the public and broadcast by the media so that the public will get a more immediate sense of the discussions between the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authority.<\/p> <p> The next sections provide, as one would expect, for the chief executive of the authority to account to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the authority's expenditure and to other committees of the Oireachtas in respect of general administrative matters.  The advertisements have been placed and the competition is under way for the appointment of the CEO.  It is an entirely independent process and that decision will be taken by the Garda authority.<\/p> <p> Part 8 includes amendments to the provisions of the principal Act relating to GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate to take account of the establishment of the authority.  The key amendments in the various changes within GSOC include, for example, a requirement in section 45 for GSOC to promote mediation and informal resolution of appropriate complaints.  This is an important initiative that many have been speaking about as necessary to ensure a more effective and efficient resolution of complaints made by the public to GSOC.  A provision in section 48 will enable the authority to request GSOC to investigate any matter relating to policing services that gives rise to a concern that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  A provision in section 49 will enable the authority, subject to the consent of the Minister, to request GSOC to investigate any behaviour of the Garda Commissioner in the context of his or her functions relating to policing services that leads it to believe that the Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.  There is further detail in that regard, which, I am sure, will emerge on Committee Stage, in relation to the change in GSOC's powers.  Part 9 contains miscellaneous provisions.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate that the overall objective of the Government's programme of justice reform, of which the authority is a key element, is to bring forward necessary changes to improve policing services in the State and to maintain public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The establishment of the policing authority will, I believe, bring about a fundamental change in the area of policing and, as I mentioned earlier, give effect to the Government's commitment to deliver a sea change in the oversight of policing in the State.  People should not underestimate the sea change that is involved in the establishment of the Garda authority given the history over the decades of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reporting to the Minister.  I believe that the changes provided for in the Bill are prudent, necessary and will, in the future, benefit not only the public, but also the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400010#H01100","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443089400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party fully supports the establishment of a new independent policing authority to oversee the policing service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This authority has been deemed necessary following a number of revelations as to how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated, the resignation of the Garda Commissioner following an intervention from the Taoiseach as shown in the Fennelly commission interim report and the failure of the Government and senior Garda management to respond to internal criticisms of malpractice within the Garda force.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Fine Gael Party's running of the Department of Justice and Equality has been farcical and has resulted in unprecedented scandals, mismanagement, investigations and resignations in the justice sector.  In fairness, I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald's commitment to improve this situation.  The independent policing authority should go some way towards restoring the public's confidence in how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates following a number of chaotic years.<\/p>  <p>  Even the introduction of this Bill has not been without controversy.  The policing authority was due to begin operating in December 2014 but it still has not begun its work in full.  Despite the Government appointing a chair designate of the authority, a comprehensive budget to run the new body has yet to be agreed.  Without a proper budget and without proper resources, this authority will be toothless and unable to do the job required.  I hope the Minister can outline when a full budget and staff will be agreed for the authority and when it will be fully operational.  It is almost a year after the authority was supposed to be fully operational and we all deserve clarity in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  There is also increasing commentary that this Bill has been watered down to reduce the Garda Commissioner's accountability to the authority, that human rights will not form part of the authority's remit and that it has reduced powers surrounding oversight as to the resources of the Garda force.  The Government continually states that this legislation will result in the most fundamental change in how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates since the State's foundation.  I hope the Minister and the Government are willing to make these reforms stick.  We have seen how the legal services Bill has been watered down and delayed for the past two years.  I hope we are not witnessing a similar rolling back of reforms in the Bill now before the House.<\/p>  <p>  We must ask ourselves whether this Bill will stand the test of time or if further reform will be necessary in the years to come.  We must all learn from the example of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which failed to prevent the malpractice which has been witnessed in certain quarters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past three years.  We need to ensure that this Bill will last.  I believe the jury is still out on the legislation in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I must raise also the question of the unity of senior Garda management at present.  Recently, it was reported that a significant number of assistant commissioners arranged their own meeting in Portlaoise to discuss issues of concern.  Notably, no invitation was issued to the Garda Commissioner.  I am not sure who was aware of that meeting.  This is a concerning and unprecedented development and the Minister should outline why she believes this meeting took place, if she considers it appropriate and if she believes it is conducive to the workings and management of the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  If the national police service is to operate effectively to keep the people safe and to tackle crime, it must act in unison in its cause.  Senior management have a duty and responsibility to focus on their roles and strategic areas to guarantee a fully functioning police force.  One of the most obvious failings of the Garda force, as outlined in the Guerin report, was the total failure of senior Garda oversight of what was happening in the Cavan and Monaghan area.  I hope the new Garda authority will address this failing of oversight which may still exist in many parts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to ensure that the trust the public currently has in the Garda is maintained.  In this regard, the Bill will play a vital role.<\/p>  <p>  The justice sector has a long road to travel to restore full confidence in its operation.  One legacy of recent controversies is the failure to fill senior justice positions.  I question why we still have not seen the appointment of a deputy commissioner to the Garda force.<\/p><p>The Garda website still names the current Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, as the deputy commissioner for operations of the force.  Given the importance of this role, I question why this is the case, given the fact the Garda Commissioner has been in her position, acting or otherwise, since March 2014.  There seems to be great difficulty in appointing new personnel in the justice sector as a result of the scorched earth left in justice by the Minister's predecessor.  The Minister has yet to appoint a Secretary General, which must result in the undermining of the performance of the Department, which is one of the most important in the State.  The Minister might update us on the process.<\/p> <p> The swift establishment of the Garda Authority must be a priority, given that a number of matters require urgent attention from Government, the Garda and the Garda Authority.  The scourge of burglaries in particular needs immediate attention.  I have raised the matter in the House several times this week and it is a theme of discussion at the National Ploughing Championships.  I raise it again today out of frustration.  We have witnessed, over the summer, some of the most violent crimes committed against elderly people who have been burgled in their homes.  The elderly lady who was burgled in Bray, 90 years of age and assaulted and dragged around her own home, is a case in point.  It is outrageous that there is not a more comprehensive response from the Government.<\/p> <p> This week, I stated ironically that there were more garda&iacute; outside Leinster House at midday to police a phantom protest than there were in rural communities across Ireland.  This shows the Government's priorities when allocating Garda resources.  Burglary is up 8% in the latest CSO crime statistics.  There were 28,583 recorded burglaries in the 12 month period ending in the first quarter of 2015.  Yet nothing seems to be done.  For months, the Government denied that there was a problem.  It hid behind the fact that the CSO had stopped publishing crime statistics.  It cannot deny that there is a crisis.  The Minister has promised legislative reform in burglary law and bail law.  When will this legislation be enacted?<\/p> <p> Specifically looking at our bail laws, 8,077 burglaries were committed by people who were on bail in the period from 2011 to date.  As I have already said, this is outrageous and shows that our criminal justice system is working for the criminals, not for the ordinary decent people of our country.  It is time the Government woke up to the crisis and spent more time acting to end the burglary crisis than on press releases and photo shoots.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has already published a number of pieces of legislation to address the crisis, all of which have been ignored.  We have already stated that our first priority in justice is to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary membership and technology to provide a first-class police service.  We will not let rural Ireland go unprotected.  We will make the criminal justice system work for our ordinary, law abiding citizens again.  We will listen to local communities' concerns when they say they live in fear in their homes.  We will act.  We will not over promise and under deliver, as we have witnessed from the opposite side of the House.  We will not sit on our hands.  While I welcome the Bill, questions remain surrounding the Government's commitment to comprehensive reform and its full implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400013#L00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443090000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>It is nice that the Bill has come before the House at long last.  The Bill was a central part of the &ldquo;urgent reform&rdquo; promised by the Government following the Garda crisis over a year ago.  The whole area of administration and application of justice in the State has had a disturbing recent past.  As a result, public confidence has been undermined and is slow to recover.  The recovery has been hampered by unnecessary delays and a lack of urgency by this Government.  That is, until the Taoiseach published the findings of the Fennelly report.  I am glad to see the Bill before the House in the wake of the findings of the Fennelly commission.  The Taoiseach tried to fight the Fennelly fire by selectively reading the findings and trying to convince himself that he was, somehow, vindicated.  We all know that this is far from the truth.  No amount of spin can cover up the fact that the report found that the sending of Mr. Brian Purcell to the home of the Garda Commissioner was the \"immediate catalyst\" for his decision to retire, and furthermore that this was a decision which the Commissioner was right to think was what he was being asked to do.<\/p>  <p>  The actions of the Attorney General, which left Mr. Justice Fennelly puzzled and perplexed, only added to the debacle and were testament to what Sinn F&eacute;in was saying all along, namely, that the Government did not have a handle on affairs and was at a loss to know what to do.  The actions of those involved in the entire debacle were terrifying for those of us looking on.  The people who were meant to be in charge of justice were not up to the job.  It was a remarkable display of incompetence and definitely did not inspire confidence among the Members of these Houses or, more importantly, the citizens.  This is exactly why we need an independent policing board with proper powers to oversee the administration of justice.  I repeat: this is exactly why we need an independent policing board with proper powers to oversee the administration of justice.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistently calling for an independent policing authority.  We believe such an authority is central to the reform of policing in this State.  An independent policing authority was an integral part of our reform document that we published last year, following our experiences of all submissions made in this State and the experiences of our team who negotiated the changes to policing in the North.  The establishment of a policing authority is, therefore, welcome and a number of provisions in the Bill are commendable.  The consultations and co-ordination with joint policing committees, in particular, is welcome.  The creation of Garda performance targets is also a commendable action, as is the establishment of a Garda code of ethics.  The overall objective in relation to the holding of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account and providing effective oversight is what is needed.<\/p>  <p>  However, unfortunately, the Bill has a number of missed opportunities which should have ensured that the policing authority was truly independent in its functions.  Contrary to what the Government is advocating, the authority, as proposed in the Bill, is not independent, nor does it have the necessary powers and functions we need.  The authority, as the Government proposes, would not, if it had been established, have had any impact on the shambles of events as they unfolded during the period the Fennelly commission investigated.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will still be accountable to the Minister, as was the case when the former Commissioner was effectively sacked.  This is not in any way independent and Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to amend this so that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to the authority.  Continuing with the theme of independence, I am concerned regarding the limited independence of the authority in the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and the deputy Garda commissioners.  We support the recommendation from Transparency International that the authority should have the unrestricted ability to appoint and remove senior officers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, irrespective of their rank.  An independent member of the Judiciary appointed by the Chief Justice, not by the Minister, should be responsible for the final determination of disputes as to whether a particular matter relates to policing services or security services.  We will also seek to amend this aspect of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the Bill should be amended in a number of areas to remove the requirement that the authority seek the consent of the Minister before exercising a particular function.  The requirement that the authority seek the consent of the Minister before approving the annual report, as well as the Minister's, as opposed to the Garda Commissioner's, involvement in setting the Garda priorities limits the independence of the authority and undermines its very purpose.  I note the flaws relating to membership of the authority.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a 21 member authority to allow for a diverse membership that is representative of society.<\/p><p>This authority would comprise 12 ordinary members, who would come through the public appointments process and would be representative of society, and nine political members, who would be elected using the d'Hondt method.  The chairperson should also be elected by the 12 ordinary members, as opposed to being appointed by the Minister.  I believe the absence of political representation on the authority is a mistake.  Political representation, as in the North, would ensure public accountability and help to develop confidence in the policing authority.  The composition of this political representation that has been proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in would not compromise the independence of the authority, as it would ensure an in-built majority of 12 independent ordinary members at all times.<\/p> <p> I note that the authority&rsquo;s functions relating to the monitoring of human rights have been tampered with since the original general scheme of the Bill was first published.  The human rights monitoring function is now entirely absent.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes the authority has a central part to play in the monitoring of Garda compliance on human rights standards.  The proposal to remove this function from the authority is unacceptable.  Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to amend the Bill to re-insert this function.<\/p> <p> While we welcome the establishment of the policing authority, the remaining challenge is to ensure the authority is truly independent in the exercise of its functions.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in a new beginning for policing, similar to that in the Six Counties.  We want an open and transparent policing service that is representative of everyone residing in this State.  Such a service should be strengthened, sustainable and capable of delivering on the needs of a modern force.  It should help to rebuild public confidence in our justice system.  This Bill goes some way towards creating such a service.  As I have outlined, there are a number of ways in which the authority could be strengthened, particularly with regard to its independence and oversight responsibilities.  Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to do this on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p> <p> It is important to assert that despite the travails of recent years, the overwhelming majority of the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are serving today and have served over the decades are honourable, decent and patriotic.  They deserve the full support of this State.  We merely want to have a police service that does them justice.  Such a service should be a genuine meritocracy in its appointment of sergeants, inspectors and superintendents.  This applies right up to the Garda Commissioner, who should be appointed through an independent meritocratic process that is fully accountable to the new independent policing authority.  That is where we want to get to.  It is important for those of us who have known members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during our lives - we may have played football with them or served on community committees with them - and have spoken to them about the roles they play to reassert that the overwhelming majority of them deserve the loyalty and respect of these Houses.  Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of officers have been failed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's structures and systems and by a minority of their colleagues.  That is the important message today.  We are not seeking to sap the morale of garda&iacute; or undermine the work they do.  We want to make things better, stronger and more accountable.  We want to boost and lift the morale of garda&iacute; by giving them a professional policing service with some of the best standards in the world.  It is important for garda&iacute; to be able to get up in the morning and feel proud to be part of the force.  That is the key challenge for us in these Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400014#M00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443090600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Paul Murphy.

Before the summer, we did a great deal of work on this legislation and went through the various sections.  I will have time to cover just a few sections today.  Generally speaking, I consider that the proposed authority is much weaker than the one we proposed in our Bill.  It is clear that ministerial and political control over the authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner is to be retained.  The proposed authority will be a weak and toothless body tainted by Government and ministerial influence.  It will not have the capacity to provide adequate oversight and monitoring functions over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner.  It will not have the capacity to hold the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner to account.<\/p>  <p>  The Government seems to have missed the point completely regarding the primary function of the authority, which is to provide democratic accountability.  A policing authority should be a way for the citizens to hold the Garda to account through a more direct form of democratic accountability than is currently provided for through parliamentary accountability of the Garda through the Minister for Justice and Equality in the D&aacute;il.  Membership of the authority is to consist of Civil Service representatives and people with legal and human rights backgrounds.  There is no mention of representation of civil society groups or minorities, who are most at risk of Garda malpractice, as we had proposed.  The Bill permits the authority, subject to the consent of the Minister, to ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to investigate any behaviour of the Garda Commissioner in the context of his or her functions relating to policing matters that leads it to believe the Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.  How can the authority be expected to hold the Commissioner to account when it cannot investigate the Commissioner without the Minister's consent?  The Commissioner remains under the political protection of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of national security remains one of the over-riding issues in the proposed legislation.  Uniquely in Europe and other common law countries, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for both policing and national security issues.  Conor Brady, who is a former GSOC commissioner, has noted that the invoking of national security by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent full investigation is already a huge obstacle.  Under the proposed legislation, the Minister is the final arbiter if there is disagreement on whether an issue is considered a policing or a security one.  As the Minister may be self-interested in this categorisation, it is illogical to consider this a safeguard of any sort.  The proposed definition of national security includes \"acts intended to subvert or undermine parliamentary democracy of the institutions of the State but not including lawful advocacy, protest or dissent unless carried on in conjunction with any of those acts.\"  It is clear that the current Government would consider the May Day and Shell to Sea protests, and more recently the water charges and water installation protests, to come under this national security heading.  This would allow the Minister to retain full and direct control.  Therefore, the authority would have no role to play in any policing issue arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400015#N00600","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1443090600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>That is ridiculous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400015#N00700","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1443090600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I have mentioned some of the issues in Part 1 - sections 1 to 7 - of the Bill, so I will not go back over them.  Part 2 of the Bill relates to the personnel and organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On the appointments issue, section 8 of the Government's Bill sets out that the Garda Commissioner and any deputy Garda Commissioners are to be appointed by the Government and the Government shall accept the nomination of the authority.  However, the authority can only nominate in accordance with the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, which will provide it with one name only.  The authority will have to seek the prior written approval of the Government before it can ask the PAS to undertake a selection competition.  It will also have to get the approval of the Minister before agreeing the selection criteria and process with the PAS for the competition.  Furthermore, the Government may veto the authority's nomination in \"exceptional circumstances\", a phrase that is not defined.<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 also sets out that if the Garda Commissioner or any deputy resigns, he or she will have to address his or her letter of notification to the Minister, and the Government will notify the authority later that the Commissioner or the deputy has resigned.  Under the Government's new Bill, removal from office may be by Government decision alone, with only a duty to consult the authority if the reason relates to policing services.  This is for the same reasons set out in the 2005 Act.  The authority can only recommend to the Government that the Commissioner or deputy be removed if the reason relates to policing services.  In any event, the Government is obliged only to consider that recommendation and not to act upon it.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill also provides that both the Government, for policing and State security reasons, and the authority, in terms of policing services, have the power to remove assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents.  It also proposes that the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform will determine the number of appointments to assistant Garda Commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent but that the authority may make these appointments, subject to a selection competition and any regulations that may be made.  As this means the system under the 2006 and 2014 regulations will remain in place, it will not be a question of selection by the PAS.  Instead, the promotions advisory council and the promotions advisory board, controlled by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, will decide the candidates that the authority will be asked to rubber-stamp.<\/p><p>The power of the authority has been weakened since the proposed heads of the Bill in November, in which the authority alone had the power to remove assistant Commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents from their positions.  Now, both the Government and the authority have that power.<\/p> <p> It is difficult to see how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be expected to function as a cohesive and disciplined body when, depending on one's rank, one can be removed by, and thus answerable to, one, two or even three different bodies, namely, the Government, the authority and the Garda Commissioner.  Further confusion arises where one body appoints and another has the power to remove, for example, in the case of assistant Commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, where the authority makes these appointments - at least nominally, with the Minister deciding how many appointments are to be made - but both the authority and the Garda Commissioner can remove such appointees.<\/p> <p> The authority should have full power of appointment of the Garda Commissioner, subject only to consultation with the Government.  It is unfair and irrational to ask the authority to be responsible for systemic issues and policies and performance issues when it cannot appoint or remove those responsible for implementing those policies and priorities, in other words, the Garda Commissioner and the deputy Commissioners.  Given that the assistant Commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents all work in a hierarchical structure under the Commissioner and deputy Commissioners, who are appointed by the Government, giving the authority the power to appoint and remove them is meaningless.  Furthermore, this power of the authority is largely circumscribed by existing regulations regarding promotion, which will continue.  Through these regulations the Minister and the Commissioner will continue to make these decisions through their proxies on the promotion board.  It is also unfair and irrational to expect the authority to be responsible for resources, budgets and staffing if it has no part to play in deciding the number of appointments to be made to senior management ranks, for example, assistant Commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents.<\/p> <p> On the code of ethics, the Bill now proposes that the authority shall, within 12 months, establish a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for members and internal whistleblowing provisions.  However, the authority is obliged to consult more bodies than the Minister would have had to consult had she ever drafted the code of ethics.  For example, the authority will have to consult the Garda unions whereas the Minister would not have had to do so under the 2005 Act.  The authority also has to consult the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition to European policing standards, the authority must also have regard to the policing principles when drafting the code of ethics.  The clause regarding a breach of the code of ethics being a breach of discipline which was in the heads of the Bill in November is not in the finalised legislation.  Similarly, the code of ethics as guidance for garda&iacute; in carrying out their functions was included in the very important new policing principles but has been removed.  Currently, the 2007 discipline regulations ensure a breach of the code of ethics, if it existed, would be a breach of discipline.  However, the regulations are only secondary legislation and can be revoked at any point by the Minister and regulations, when drafted or being revoked, never go before the House to be debated as they are just the exercise of Minister's executive power.  Therefore the authority will bring in a code of ethics with great fanfare but breaching it will not be a breach of discipline because of the changes in this Act.  There will be no sanction for breaching the code, rendering it meaningless.<\/p> <p> The introduction of the trade unions as one of the bodies the authority is required to consult is curious as the Minister would not have been required to consult the unions if she had ever gone ahead and drafted a code of ethics.  There is a requirement to consult the Garda Commissioner as representative of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this really would have been sufficient.  It is curious also that there is a requirement to consult the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as setting standards of conduct and policing practice cannot be considered an industrial relations issue.  There is no reference to the code of ethics or the Garda code being published.  The biggest problem with the newly proposed legislation is that there will be no sanction for breaching the code of ethics which makes it meaningless.  This is even weaker than the position under the current 2005 legislation, where we have no code of ethics because no Minister ever went ahead and drafted one.<\/p> <p> On the roles of Minister, the authority and the Garda Commissioner, the Bill now proposes that section 20 be amended in order that the authority, with the written approval of the Minister, shall determine the priorities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and establish performance targets and can only determine or revise them following consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister will lay these priorities before the House on receipt from the authority.  The Commissioner must inform the authority of measures taken to achieve the objectives of the priorities determined and performance targets established and supply that information within the time specified by the authority.  Regarding security services principles, the Commissioner shall follow the same procedure but just be answerable to the Minister.<\/p> <p> Section 21 sets out that the strategy statement shall be submitted by the Commissioner to the authority rather than to the Minister for approval but removes from the authority the power the Minister had to set the form and the manner of the statement.  The Commissioner is required to have regard to Government policy, the priorities determined by the authority regarding policing and the Minister regarding security.  The Garda Professional Standards Unit, GPSU report under section 24 shall now be submitted by the Commissioner to the authority and not to the Minister.  The Minister's power under section 25 to issue directives to the Commissioner remains solely with the Minister and the authority may only recommend to the Minister that he or she issues a directive.  The Bill provides a new power to the Minister to issue directives to the authority also.  The Commissioner is still required to have regard to any relevant policies of the Minister or the Government and any ministerial directive issued to him or her when performing his or her functions, along with the new policing principles, as per section 5.<\/p> <p> The authority cannot be considered independent from the Minister if it is in a linear hierarchical relationship with the Minister, as is demonstrated by the power in the amended section 25 which permits the Minister, on the approval of the Government, to give written directives to the authority regarding any of the authority's functions under the Act and the authority shall comply and shall also inform the Minister of the measures taken by the authority to comply.  There is limited usefulness in severing the Commissioner's linkage with the Minister if it is intended to restore this linkage at the authority level.  It is no use just sticking the authority in between the Minister and the Commissioner if the authority itself answers to the Minister and so becomes just an extra link in the same chain.  As argued by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, \"if it is to break the historic cycle of unwholesome ministerial influence on policing, Ireland's new authority must be fully independent\".  Furthermore, the authority is not given any power to issue directives to the Commissioner.  The authority can only recommend to the Minister that a directive regarding policing be issued to the Commissioner from the Minister.  The Minister's power under the 2005 Act to give directives to the Commissioner, that is, to give direct orders to the Commissioner, remains the same and is not even shared with the authority.  Thus there is no change in the potential for direct ministerial influence on the Garda Commissioner's operational control of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, emphasised that the independence of the police service from Executive control is central to the credibility and capacity of the police service to protect human rights, yet An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains under direct Executive control under the new proposals.  There is also no change to section 26(3) which makes the Commissioner directly accountable to the Minister in the performance of his or her functions and those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This accountability provision has been criticised by Professor Walsh as reinforcing ministerial control powers by rendering the Commissioner statutorily accountable to the Minister for the first time in the history of the State. <\/p> <p> On the issue of accountability, Part 5 now proposes no change to section 40 which sets out that the Garda Commissioner shall account fully to the Government and Minister through the Secretary General for any aspect of his or her functions, including the duty to provide any document.  Clearly, the Commissioner remains accountable to the Minister and Government only.  The new Bill just adds a section setting out that the Commissioner shall report to the authority with regard to policing services to facilitate the performance by the authority of its functions under this Act and extends the duty of Commissioner to provide documents to the authority also.  The wide breadth of communication between Minister and Commissioner remains under section 41 and a clause is added to set out that if and in so far as a report by the Commissioner to the Minister relates to policing services, the Minister shall inform the authority of those matters.  The Minister does not even have to provide the authority with a copy of the report.  Furthermore, there is no comparable duty on the Commissioner inserted to keep the authority informed on significant developments relating to policing, for example, peace and public order, but only to keep the authority informed of matters relevant to the authority's functions.<\/p> <p> No change is proposed to section 47 to provide the authority with crime statistics.  Surely crime statistics should now be reported to the authority and not the Minister, or at least to both.  It will be difficult for the authority to deal with policy issues if it is not entitled to the full statistical data that are available.  There is no change to section 40 regarding direct accountability to the Government and Minister nor to section 40(2) and the all-encompassing duty on the Commissioner to provide any document or statement in the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Minister requests, for example, documents relating to Deputy Paul Murphy's arrest, which Professor Dermot Walsh has referred to as an \"alarming provision\".<\/p><p>The Bill, as published, rows back on commitment in the heads of the Bill to make the Garda Commissioner fully accountable to the board alone regarding policing matters.  As with the 2005 Act, the Commissioner is to remain solely accountable to the Minister and Government.  This is a fundamental change to the proposal in the heads.  What is the point of having a Garda authority if it is not being asked to hold the Commissioner to account and if the Commissioner remains lawfully accountable to the Government and Minister?  The Commissioner's duty to provide updates regarding policing continues to be owed to the Minister rather than the board, which is also a departure from the proposal made in the heads.<\/p> <p> According to the legislation, the first eight members of the Garda authority will be directly appointed by the Government following advertisements that were placed in June.  The first authority will set the tone for the relationship between the authority and the Garda Commissioner and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a negative step for an authority that is supposed to be strong and independent and mark a departure from politicised policing.<\/p> <p> Membership of the authority is to be drawn from Civil Service representatives and individuals with a legal or human rights background.  The failure of the Bill to make reference to representation of civil society groups is a major disappointment.  In addition, the Garda authority should include some political representation, albeit not a majority, with the Opposition and Government being given equal representation.  This would be in line with a recommendation made by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Dr. Vicky Conway and Professor Dermot Walsh.  In an effort to retain Government control over the authority, the proposals do not allow for any political representation or membership, perhaps because to do so would require Opposition involvement.<\/p> <p> The chairperson-designate of the Garda Authority is a career civil servant who was appointed without an interview process, having resigned as head of the Revenue Commissioners one month prior to her appointment.  This was clearly a set-up and means of exerting and re-channelling ministerial influence through the chairperson by having, as it were, the Minister's man on the inside.  The process used amounted to an interference in the independence and impartiality of the Garda authority before it has been even established.  Moreover, Josephine Feehily was involved the selection of the new Garda Commissioner in her first indirect wielding of political power over policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400015#N00800","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443091800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to refrain from naming individuals in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400017#P00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1443091800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>No problem.

What we have is an attempt to make policing look like something that it is not and giving the impression that we have some form of independent and democratic control and accountability of the Garda.  The Bill does not propose significant change.<\/p>  <p>  When I state that we have political policing in this State I am not making paranoid accusations or claiming that all garda&iacute; are against all of us on the left but pointing out that policing in this State operates to protect the interests of the 1% - the establishment and elite - when its interests are challenged.  Despite the snorts of derision that come from establishment politicians and the media when this issue is raised, the examples of political policing are very stark at this stage.  To take the example of water meter protests, massive Garda resources are being used to impose water meters on working class communities which do not want them and are protesting against them, yet the same communities are unable to access Garda resources when they need them.  Almost a year ago, incredible numbers of garda&iacute; were deployed in Clare Hall and Limewood to force water meters into housing estates.  When we fast-forward to yesterday, we learn that six people were arrested in Waterford at anti-water charges protests.  A YouTube video of the incident that is circulating on social media suggests policing at the protest was heavy-handed.  These are regular occurrences that are no longer newsworthy because people are arrested on almost a daily basis for protesting against water meters being installed in their estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400017#P00400","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1443091800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I am advised that the Deputy is straying beyond the scope of the Bill.

The point is that we do not have democratic accountability for the Garda, nor is such accountability proposed.  If we are to avoid the types of incidents I have highlighted, we must have democratic accountability at a national and community level.  This means having working class communities and ordinary people take charge of policing resources and priorities through their democratic representatives.  That issue is related to the Bill.<\/p><p>The arrests of 27 people in Jobstown were unquestionably heavy-handed and completely unjustifiable in terms of the number of garda&iacute; involved and the style of arrest used, etc.  When the leaking of information about these arrests was raised on Leaders' Questions yesterday, the Taoiseach did not appear remotely bothered.  That persons have been named in the national media following a leak that is likely to have emanated from the Garda and are likely to face serious criminal charges which could result in significant prison time is a serious problem.  These leaks, which were very likely to have come from the Garda, were an interference in the right of privacy of the individuals in question and the administration of justice.  They were also an attempt to shape public opinion and terrorise a community, some of whose members are facing serious charges.<\/p><p>The same Garda division took a decision to issue summonses to Deputy Joan Collins and 11 other individuals for participating in anti-water meter charges protests.  Despite these protests being non-controversial, simple and peaceful, people are facing significant criminal charges.  The chief superintendent who is responsible for Crumlin and Jobstown made an incredible decision - this, too, is relevant to the Bill - to refuse a permit to a democratically organised political party to collect money, which it has done in the past and which other political parties are doing at present.  The justification for this decision was given in a letter, which states that &quot;previous protests in my division ... have resulted in persons being arrested for Public Order offences&quot;.  The presumption of innocence has been thrown out the window.  The letter continues: <\/p><blockquote>The collection permit has been refused because I believe the proceeds of the collection or a portion thereof would be used to facilitate protests sponsored by the Anti Austerity Alliance.  I believe any further protests within my Division would see further Public Order offences being committed.<\/blockquote><p>This incredible decision chokes off access to fund-raising opportunities for a political force which does not accept money from big business or developers and relies on ordinary people and the types of collections for which it applied.  The decision strangles the ability of a political group to function on the basis that it may organise protests.  It is another clear example of the political policing that is taking place.  It is not accidental that the person responsible for this decision is also the person responsible for policing in Jobstown and Crumlin and, I presume, for the decision as to the nature of the arrests the decision to serve summonses.<\/p><p>Another point on which I was given short shrift by the Taoiseach yesterday relates to Operation Mizen.

It is a crisis which needs to be tackled with determination and a real sense of urgency.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, rents are soaring.  Up to 130,000 applicants are on social housing waiting lists and housing supply is minimal.  The rent caps in the rent supplement scheme are so out of line with market rents that they are little more than a fantasy.  The Central Bank deposit rules have made it incredibly difficult for first-time buyers in major urban areas and many of those who are looking to trade up are, in effect, trapped by the 20% deposit rule.  Mortgage interest relief is gone for home buyers and banks are leaning on indebted landlords who have good tenants to force them to push rents towards market rents.  Banks are repossessing homes with increasing zeal and do not even have to comply now with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears before proceeding with the repossession of a home.  The cruellest face of the housing crisis is the scandal of homelessness with people sleeping rough on our streets and 1,500 children living in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  With each passing day, we are treated to another leak about what the Government intends to do to tackle the crisis.  Today's instalment is tax breaks for landlords if they accept tenants on rent supplement or the housing assistance payment.  That proposal will simply not work, primarily because it will not add a single new unit to housing stock.  Second, if a landlord has the option of accepting rent of &euro;1,400 a month in the private market or taking &euro;800 per month under the rent supplement or HAP scheme, he or she would want one hell of a tax break to choose the latter.  Every Deputy is inundated day after day with housing related issues.  The elephant in the room is the lack of housing supply.  The consistent message we are all getting from the construction sector is that it is simply not viable to build.  There are a number of steps the Government needs to take urgently.  First, it must examine why it costs so much to build a home in Ireland today.  It must examine the State controlled costs which are an important part of those input costs, including development levies and the Irish Water connection which I am told is adding &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 to the cost of building a new home.  It must make finance available so that residential construction can get underway.  In July, a &euro;500 million was announced through the Strategic Investment Fund, but it is not yet up and running.  It will be towards the end of the year at the earliest before it is operational and I am told that the cost of borrowing from the fund will be in the region of 14%, which is absolutely mad at a time when the State is borrowing at record low interest rates of between 1% and 2%.<\/p>  <p>  Within the T&aacute;naiste's own Department, she needs to lift the rent caps immediately to bring some sense of reality to the rent supplement and HAP schemes and to introduce a level of rent certainty.  This is a crisis in the here and now.  It is all very fine to talk about grandiose plans for billions of euro to build thousands of houses, but the reality is that tonight 1,500 children in Ireland will sleep in emergency accommodation.  There are 130,000 families on the social housing list.  It is a scandal, it is not acceptable and it is not going to get any better without major intervention.  There is no building and there is no supply and the problem is only going to get worse.  What is the Government going to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400018#Q00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1443092400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the general economic recovery that is under way and that, thankfully is getting stronger every day, I accept that as a country we have a legacy issue in relation to housing arising, as Deputy Michael McGrath well knows, from the collapse in the building industry.  Leaving that aside, I note the following on rent supplement which I am not sure people like the Deputy particularly understand.  Through rent supplement, we provide housing and homes for 65,000 individuals and families.  It is one of the largest suppliers of rental accommodation in the country.  What we do and have been doing for some time is to negotiate rents on an individual basis with landlords.  The 65,000 homes in question constitute approximately 30% of the entire rental market in the State and our concern as a major player in the private rented market is about what will happen if we simply follow the demands of some landlords who, I have to say, are excessively greedy.  The Deputy referred to it himself and let us not put a tooth in it.  They are excessively greedy and they are looking for more and more money every couple of months to a scale that is not particularly justified on economic grounds.  We can understand that they may be looking to recover losses from the crash, but what we are exploring as a Government currently is the provision of rent certainty.  In other European countries where the rental model works quite well, rents are stable over a three-year period or longer in relation to the tenancy agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Coming back to rent supplement, I will give the Deputy the figures to the end of September.  We have negotiated new rental agreements which have generally involved significant increases in rents on a case-by-case basis.  Working with the family or individual concerned, we have negotiated almost 2,700 agreements through the new, improved community welfare service that the Department of Social Protection offers since we took over the service from the HSE a couple of years ago.  The Deputy will know that we work on a protocol with Threshold and a number of other agencies, including Simon on a smaller scale, and have actually negotiated over 1,200 agreements on that basis.<\/p><p>That means that we have negotiated this year.  Of the 65,000 people and families in rental accommodation, many of their landlords do not regularly raise rents, but there is a cohort of landlords who do and often ask tenants to leave houses, frequently because a returning emigrant child is going to use the family property.  That is fine and valid.<\/p> <p> I just want the Deputy to be sure.  I want to send out the message to people on rent supplement - we text over 40,000 such customers on a monthly basis, but I want all Deputies to hear this and pass the message on to people who attend their clinics with difficulties - that, if they contact the community welfare service, not only can we negotiate rent successfully, but we will, as the statistics show.  This should assist families.  The one-to-one contact is also a way of reaching out for more detailed assistance in a variety of other areas, for instance, helping individuals or families into education, training and employment.  It is a different kind of in-depth service.<\/p> <p> In June 2012, we raised rents across the board by an average of &euro;12,000.  Two months later, landlords were back looking for another 10% to 20%.

There is now a growing scandal around the revelations that an illegal &pound;15 million fixer's fee was to be paid as part of the sell-off of this Northern loan book.  As the T&aacute;naiste may be aware, this matter was brought to NAMA's attention by PIMCO, a potential US bidder.  It also advised NAMA that the proposed recipients of this fixer's fee included Frank Cushnahan, a member of NAMA's Northern advisory committee.  Mr. Cushnahan originally was appointed by Fianna F&aacute;il and was reappointed by the present Government.  NAMA initially claimed that its Northern advisory committee was not privy to confidential information regarding this sale.  However, it since has been disclosed that this committee discussed potential purchases on at least two occasions before the loan book was sold at a huge loss to Irish taxpayers.  Mr. Cushnahan was present at these meetings.  He later acted as an adviser to a bidder in the sale of the Northern loan book.  Has the T&aacute;naiste been briefed on these matters?  Has she raised them with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Noonan?  Is it acceptable, in the light of these disturbing revelations, that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, continues to protect NAMA from public scrutiny?  NAMA is an arm of the State and I hope the T&aacute;naiste agrees that it should be accountable.  When will the Minister, Deputy Noonan, come before the D&aacute;il and make a statement on these serious issues of public interest?  Moreover, as I have requested, along with Deputy Pearse Doherty and others, will the Government establish a commission of investigation into the management and operations of NAMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400020#S02300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1443093600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>First, I am advised that the loan sale was executed in a proper manner.  There has been much confusion and conflation in the coverage of this matter.  Much of the commentary has come in detail from various sources within Northern Ireland.  My understanding is that there is an ongoing examination of a wide variety of statements and allegations made by different individuals in the North by a committee at Stormont.  The second point is that the loan portfolio was sold for &euro;1.5 billion because that is what the properties securing the loans were worth.  In this regard, one has a constant comparison of pre-crash values with post-crash sales.  I believe Deputy Adams has told Members previously that he owns a residential house, as well as a holiday home, and I do not know whether he has another house in the Republic.

It states that the conflation of the issues involved in this is dangerous.  It also states, and the T&aacute;naiste has ignored this although it has been the main thrust of my question and the main thrust of our concerns, that the concern was that fees were to be paid to a Mr. Cushnahan who was a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee and that this would constitute a clear conflict of interest and would cause reputational damage to all involved.  That is the core it.  Fixer's fees of &pound;15 million were to be paid and this person has been named as one of those who was to be a recipient.<\/p> <p> The chairman of NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, says he briefed the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in full on this &pound;15 million fixer's fee, yet the Minister, Deputy Noonan, failed to suspend the sales process.  He failed to inform the Office of the First Minister and the Office of the Deputy First Ministers.  Apparently, these matters were also brought to the Taoiseach's attention in a letter in February 2014.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach refused to confirm this.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm it?  The businessman, Mr. Gareth Graham, has testified that he possesses thousands of recordings of phone calls by Mr. Frank Cushnahan, exposing inappropriate and, possibly, illegal conduct.  This is, as the T&aacute;naiste said, being investigated by the Assembly finance committee and the police.  The US Department of Justice is also investigating it.

I raised this issue with her before the summer recess, when I marked her card that all was not well with NAMA.  I told her that it would do her no favour to do nothing about this.  Since then, a lot more questions than answers have been thrown up.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July, the CEO of NAMA, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, argued that the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio represented the best commercial option for NAMA as, according to him, there had been little or no investor interest in acquiring either Northern Ireland assets or the associated loans.  This is not consistent with statements contained in the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee's minutes of the meeting of 7 October 2013.  At that meeting representatives of CBRE gave a summary of the Northern Ireland real estate market.  NAMA was represented at that meeting by, among others, Mr. Frank Daly.  CBRE said that, positively, rent and yield forecasts across the commercial property sector were predominantly stabilising or strengthening and added that US investment funds were showing interest.<\/p><p> Cerberus has been able to sell loans for double what it paid for them in a very short period.  Why could NAMA not do that?  If due diligence with NAMA in Dublin for Project Eagle cost &euro;1.8 million, can the T&aacute;naiste explain why the same work in the North should cost &euro;21 million?  That is what Cerberus paid over for four weeks' work.  NAMA had to do more work on due diligence than the people working for Cerberus, including those in Brown Rudnick and Tughans.  NAMA sold Project Eagle to Cerberus for approximately 27p in the pound.  The missing 73p has been picked up by the Irish taxpayer, those in the South, not the North - this is not just a Northern problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400021#T07700","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443094800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400022#U00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1443094800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>This is a seriously Southern problem.

Some 50% of the portfolio is residential in Ireland, in the South, and we have a housing crisis.  How can the Government allow Project Arrow to go ahead?

If the external members, who included Frank Cushnahan and Mr. Rowntree, were given feedback, how is this consistent with the proposition that they had no confidential information?  It was interesting that the chairman added that he wanted to remind members that the matter was extremely politically sensitive and that absolute confidentiality was required.  It is nonsense to suggest that Frank Cushnahan did not have confidential information regarding Project Eagle.  It is nonsense for NAMA to suggest that the problems are all about the purchase.

It is the committee that deals with NAMA.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Wallace is aware, NAMA was set up under fairly extraordinary legislation following a series of through-the-night meetings in this Chamber when it was established by the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance.  It was specifically structured - I am saying this to Sinn F&eacute;in Members as well - so that politicians would not be involved actively in any way in the management.  More than almost any other structure, when it comes to legislation that this D&aacute;il has passed, any active involvement, even at ministerial level, was actually precluded from the structure, such was the sensitivity of the case and the desire of the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance, to avoid any direct involvement of politicians, office-holders or others in the affairs of NAMA.<\/p>  <p>  I was the Labour Party finance spokesperson in the D&aacute;il at the time.  While I disagreed with the then Minister on many issues about NAMA - I see other people who were there at the time - I actually agreed that it was quite important that serving politicians were not involved in the business of NAMA.  That was the structure put in place by the D&aacute;il to avoid the situation that arose previously, leading up to the crash, when there had been an unhealthy and close connection between some politicians and the housing and development market and, perhaps, with banking institutions and all of that.  We still have to hear from the banking inquiry, but I imagine it is the view of many people that many of those connections were unhealthily close.  They led to bad decision-making and very bad outcomes, as Deputy Wallace has just said, for Irish taxpayers, something about which we are all extremely concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly suggest to Deputy Wallace that, if he has information, he should make that information available to the authorities and the committee in Northern Ireland investigating the matter.  In respect of NAMA, Deputy Wallace clearly has a list of significant questions he wants to put to the agency.  I strongly suggest that he uses the mechanism of the Committee of Public Accounts and the other committees of this House to progress his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400022#U01600","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1443094800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>It is the Government's duty to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400022#U01700","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1443094800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste comes from an accountancy background and she is the leader of the Labour Party.

In essence, this makes repossessing homes easier for financial institutions.  In his judgment in May, Mr. Justice Clarke strongly signalled that the Oireachtas should respond to this and that only it could close the loophole.

We have seen the horrifying images of children drowning in the Mediterranean, families having to walk hundreds of miles and Hungarian security forces using violence against these individuals.

With regard to asylum seekers or refugees coming in the context of the current European crisis, the Deputy may be aware that people will come into orientation and reception centres where they will be identified.  Any assistance, including medical assistance, will be given and identified if necessary, and fingerprinting and identification for various purposes will be done.  This period should be relatively short because the people will be coming via a European Commission-led programme.  Other people have already come from Syria via the UNHCR programme.  I was the author of Ireland's first Refugee Act, when I was Minister of State with responsibility for development.  I cannot say exactly how long the reception and orientation period will be, but in the case of people coming from places like Bosnia, it was up to six months.  This was the last significant group of refugees that we took in on an arranged basis.  We have organisations such as the Red Cross, local organisations, parishes and the faith communities offering very strong assistance to people in this particular case.  All of this will, as far as possible, be utilised.<\/p><p>We also want to emphasise, in order to help people integrate, that once those coming to Ireland have undergone reception and orientation, we would like to assist them, particularly with English language skills.  In my long experience of dealing with this area, the key point for success in integration is language, as it allows people to get a job.  My understanding is that people are generally interested in getting employment but much of it is dependent on having a working knowledge of the local language.  Fairly advanced arrangements are in place at Government level, but the discussions involving the European Commission about the arrangements are still ongoing.

The issue seemed so serious to us, as the Anti-Austerity Alliance, that in the context of the D&aacute;il not sitting, we wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality to ask a number of questions.  For example, we asked if she was aware that the Garda unit was in operation or if she was consulted about its foundation or operation.  We asked if a report was made to the Minister or the Department by the Garda Commissioner or any authorities in the Garda on the operation of the unit; how many individuals - including public representatives at council or D&aacute;il level - were the subject of surveillance, and if they were, whether they would be named; and other questions seeking an answer, because we felt them to be of fundamental public interest, particularly as the D&aacute;il was not sitting.  We received a response from the Minister but it was a one-line reply that acknowledged receipt of the letter.  There is a clear public interest in knowing what is happening in terms of surveillance of anti-austerity or anti-water-charge protestors, and the Minister should detail what she is aware of.<\/p>  <p>  Political policing is the rule rather than the exception.  That is not in the sense that policing of a traffic light or a traffic offence amounts to political policing but, rather, that when movements develop which threaten the interests of the capitalist class in the country or when the interests of the State are perceived to be challenged, garda&iacute;, against their own wishes in many circumstances, are used to enforce the interests and wishes of the 1%, as opposed to the 99%.  The examples are legion, including the kind of policing that happened around the Shell to Sea campaign, the Rossport five, Ms Maura Harrington, the 23 jailed bin charge protestors and the role of policing around the bin charges movement.  There was also the arrest and jailing of Margaretta D'Arcy.  The examples go on and include many industrial disputes, particularly in the building industry.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a revelation that this exists, but the fact that it is laid bare is an indication of how the interests are challenged.  This fundamentally relates to the role of mass civil disobedience, and particularly the mass non-payment of water charges and how that has shocked and rocked the establishment, broadly speaking, with the result of such blatant political policing.  This is precisely what should be dealt with and it is part and parcel of a struggle to transform our society and take power economically, for example, out of the hands of the 1%.  We also need a different kind of State and, as part of that, a different kind of police force.  It should be democratically accountable to the communities it is meant to serve.  On one hand, it requires on the national level a genuinely independent and authoritative policing authority, but it also requires, at a local level, real community control of garda&iacute;.  That would amount to Garda resources being used in the interests of communities, as opposed to how they are unfortunately sometimes used, which is against the interests of those communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400025#X00800","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1443096600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400025#X00900","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1443096600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>There are 20 minutes in the speaking slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400025#X01000","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1443096600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I will endeavour to keep going until I am advised to do otherwise.

The Bill marks a significant reform in the way our justice system works and it is of the utmost importance in ensuring we have a 21st century Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in supporting the Garda in the difficulties it faces on a daily basis.  Over recent years, we have seen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's morale at an all-time low, due primarily to the reduction in Garda numbers when Templemore was closed, but also to more practical issues, such as pay and the investment required across the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station network to ensure the facilities garda&iacute; were working in were up to standard.  From the 2010 National Development Plan the budget has been increased across the board by the present Government and I commend the Minister and the Cabinet on doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The policing authority will have important functions in our overall justice system, particularly in terms of overseeing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Providing this level of public oversight of our police force is important to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works efficiently and that we develop a greater level of accountability in our justice system.<\/p>  <p>  The policing authority will play an important role in recommending persons to the Government for appointment to the roles of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Garda Commissioner, and it will have responsibility for the appointment of persons to the ranks of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant Commissioner.  That is a welcome departure from the usual practice over the last few decades.  The policing authority will also have the power to remove these persons from their position for reasons related to policing services.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the policing authority will approve, with the agreement of the Minister, the annual policing plan, which comes before the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for discussion each year.  This is a welcome move as it is important that the public representatives of this House are given the opportunity to quiz the Commissioner on certain aspects of this.  I have found the Commissioner's engagement with the committee to be excellent over recent months and I thank her for her constant availability to the committee whenever we have asked her to appear before us.  The authority will be responsible for establishing a Garda code of ethics and promoting and supporting the continuous improvement of policing.  The independence of the policing authority is of critical importance here.  The nine members and the chair will be persons from diverse backgrounds, who will submit themselves through the Public Appointments Service.  I welcome this.<\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations made by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality were taken up in this process and the policing authority itself will most likely review others once it is established.  That is an important part of the development of the authority.  I understand that there is a possibility of a review of the establishment after a period of time, which the Minister has mentioned previously.  This is important in ensuring we get it right.  Having visited Northern Ireland and Scotland with the committee, along with Deputy Finian McGrath, we have seen the difficulties in establishing a new policing authority and how long it takes for it to get to grip with its role.  It would be naive for us to assume that such an authority would instantaneously get it right every time, because international examples prove that it takes time, which is to be expected.  There are great benefits in that because it is a learning experience for the authority and the expertise brought on board by the membership of the authority will be beneficial both to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the public.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about the necessity for Garda reform across the State, but one of the most important aspects of policing in this country is manpower.  If we look at the closure of Templemore by the previous Government, its reopening last year and the recruitment of more than 550 Garda&iacute; up to the end of this year, that accelerated recruitment programme is essential if we are to meet the demands of a modern 21st century Ireland.  Crime rates are, I hope, plateauing and it is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it uses modern policing techniques to tackle those issues.  Our role in this House is to support them by the provision of suitable legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I would particularly like to mention the legislation that will be brought forward to tackle prolific burglars, which I welcome.  It is essential that we prevent prolific individuals and roving gangs, which have been mentioned in the papers, from engaging in such activity by ensuring that they face suitable punishment when they are caught.  By increasing sentence times and issuing guidance to the judiciary, we will, I hope, dissuade such individuals from continuing in their practices.  With regard to the ability of the Garda to tackle such crimes, particularly since many of them are in vehicles, driving around the country on our motorway network and dipping in and out of certain towns, it is essential we provide the Garda with sufficient vehicles to do that.  As has been mentioned on a number of occasions, the Government has invested an additional sum of just under &euro;30 million to the provision of more than 370 Garda vehicles this year.  That is an essential component of providing garda&iacute; with the level of equipment they require.  There are also other issues, such as technology, including the Garda database, PULSE.  We must ensure we sufficiently fund that so that it can meet the demands of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned earlier the legislation regarding burglars.  That will impose consecutive jail sentences and will also allow the court to refuse bail in cases where the offender has a previous conviction for domestic burglary with two or more pending charges.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the Government is now in a position to establish the policing authority, which will fulfil an essential role in policing in Ireland.  However, this is only one aspect of the justice reforms and supports being implemented by this Government, and is being strengthened by the introduction of further legislation, continued recruitment and greater resourcing to support the hard\u00adworking men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their daily duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400026#Y00700","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1443097200,"counter":502,"content":"<p>This Bill represents a very important reform for our country in terms of justice.  For the first time ever we will have a new policing authority, which will be independent and will oversee the structures and performance of An Garda.  I concur completely with the Minister's observation that the establishment of the new policing authority is \"the most far reaching reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State\".<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was established in 1922 but for several decades there was no external scrutiny of the force.  The Garda Complaints Board set up in 1984 was the first attempt at providing for external scrutiny.  However, it was not until the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 that we saw the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The intervening decade has provided the time to reflect the institutions tasked with the external scrutiny of An Garda.<\/p>  <p>  It must be remembered that the relationship between the police service, the public it serves and the Government is not an issue that is unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>These matters are challenges for all democratic states and it is healthy for a democracy to conduct periodic reviews of the relationship to identify what works well and, perhaps more importantly, what is not working.<\/p> <p> Within this Bill, I believe, are measures which will restore confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and draw a line under misdeeds by a very small number of the force which involved issues such as penalty points, investigations into crimes and the recording of telephone calls.  Significant work has been invested in the preparation of the Bill.  It is important to note that the Bill draws on the comprehensive report of the independent review group of the Department of Justice and Equality in areas of relevance to the Garda.  It also adopts some of the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in October last in that committee's review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p> <p> The powers to be ascribed to the new authority are substantial.  The authority will, for example, appoint Garda superintendents and assistant commissioners and, conversely, will have the power to remove such personnel for reasons related to policing services.  The authority will also have a number of important roles in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality, including the ratification of the annual policing plan and the three-year Garda strategy, as well as determining the priorities for the policing service.<\/p> <p> Part 5 of the Bill is of considerable importance.  These sections deal with accountability and set out in no uncertain terms the obligations concerning the communications of the parties involved, such as the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner and the head of the authority.  Setting out obligations in such minute detail may be viewed as unnecessary by some, but I believe it is essential if the new policing authority is to operate effectively and if we are to avoid the miscommunication and confusion of the past.<\/p> <p> Another interesting section of the Bill is section 29, through which the new authority will take responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of joint policing committees, JPCs.  I served on the joint policing committee for County Galway and I am currently a member of the JPC for Galway city.  In my view, the JPCs are undervalued in how they provide a forum for issues of public concern to be raised.  The committee meetings are regularly monitored by media and provide an excellent platform for consultation and co-operation on policing matters at community level.<\/p> <p> Like others, I acknowledge the increase in resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in terms of both Garda numbers, with the reopening of Templemore and the hiring of Garda recruits, and investment in Garda vehicles.  Obviously, that was most necessary to maintain the force and retain proper vehicles to allow the force to police effectively.  I note there is much concern, particularly in rural areas, about the visibility of the Garda.  It is imperative that the force be out and about.  Vehicles are seen as a deterrent to crime.<\/p> <p> This Bill setting up the new independent policing authority should not be viewed in isolation.  It forms part of a number of important, but often overlooked, measures that the Government has passed.  These include the Protected Disclosures Act  2014, which provides a framework for whistleblowers to raise issues of importance or concern.  This has relevance for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but also for civil society, business and other areas.  Another important reform is the Freedom of Information Act 2014, which brought An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the remit of the freedom of information legislation for the first time.  Freedom of information legislation is widely acknowledged as being essential for transparency and openness.  These reforms and the far-reaching reforms contained in this Bill provide an opportunity for change that will enhance the police service and assist members in their important work but also provide for greater transparency and accountability, which are measures I would hope everyone in the House and outside support.  I commend the Minister for her work on this important landmark Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400026#Y00800","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443097800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I believe Deputy Finian McGrath is sharing time with Deputy Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400027#Z00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443097800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>If the Deputy is not here, if is okay with the Ceann Comhairle, I will keep going.<\/p>  <p>  First, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking on this important debate on a new piece of legislation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015.  I welcome this debate, as I feel strongly that this out-of-touch Government does still not get it in relation to policing, Garda reform, gaining the trust and respect of the public, violent crime, gangland crime and the intimidation of individuals and communities.  It is an opportunity to look at these issues in the wider society.  This debate should be about a wake-up Bill.  What I say is, \"They need to wake up and listen.\"  The Government needs to wake up to what is happening on our streets, in our communities and in the broader society.  However, they do not seem to get it.  Our people are crying out for help and a properly run and resourced Garda service.<\/p>  <p>  We all need to focus on the following issues: reform, trust and accountability.  That is the direction in which we should go.  Then we can all have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that looks to the future and that has the support and respect of our people, which is the key issue.  The Bill, and this debate, should focus on these core issues.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at the details of the legislation, the principles of which I strongly support, one can see that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new policing authority, \"the Authority,\" to oversee the exercise of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing functions.  The second key issue is that the authority will perform a wide range of functions, many of which are currently exercised by the Government or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  These are the two key elements in the legislation.  These are principles that every Member of this House should support, but Members should also come up with constructive ideas for building and developing a policing service that we all admire and trust.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us have many friends and family who have served in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and they have also expressed concern to us that we need to get back to the traditional ideas of public service, of which we should not be afraid in modern Ireland.  If one is so employed, one has the honour of being a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one is a public servant and one works in the interests of the public.  Such principles are very important.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 - sections 8 to 17, inclusive - contains ten sections and amends Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the principal Act, dealing mainly with the appointment and removal of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It also contains provisions for the establishment by the authority of a Garda code of ethics.  That is linked to my point on public service.  If we are building this code of ethics and this public service, sections 8 to 17 are important.<\/p>  <p>  Let us dig down deeper into the legislation.  Section 12 amends section 13 of the Principal Act to provide that the authority will appoint assistant Garda commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents.  Section 12 is an important section because we need to get away from the cronyism and the allegations of political interference that have gone on in the State since its foundation, and we need to appoint men and women in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on merit and ability.  I do not know how many times I have listened over the past 20 years to the stories of high-quality policemen and women who were not promoted because they did not mix in the right circles or play golf with the right senior management of the Garda.  In a modern police force, that should not be acceptable.  I know many high-quality garda&iacute;, men and women, throughout my constituency who are part of what I call the new brigade, who have a sense of good, a sense of justice, a sense of public service and a sense of assisting their local communities, but often they are not taken seriously and they are not rewarded enough.  I would say, if there is a good young man or woman, we should develop the good ones and bring them into management levels.  There are also sections within policing that are treated more seriously than others.  A good community garda in any community is very valuable and such garda&iacute; should be respected.  When I say \"valuable,\" I mean they are valuable in relation to crime prevention, which often is not taken seriously.  It is always the murders, robberies and knife crimes that become the big cases on which garda&iacute; can make their careers, whereas the good-quality garda&iacute; on the beat in the service, preventing crimes, dealing with anti-social behaviour and dealing with families in crisis often do not get the recognition they deserve.  As somebody who worked in a disadvantaged area long before I became a Deputy, I am familiar with the work that some of these garda&iacute; do on the ground and the number of individuals and families they kept out of prison, which is an important consideration.  I refer to the work of juvenile liaison officers, JLOs, in crime prevention, and the number of children aged ten, 11 or 13 whom many of us thought were lost.  The JLOs sat down, they worked with the social workers, they worked with us as the local teachers and they worked with the garda&iacute; on the ground to develop and save these children, and they are saving the children from ending up in Mountjoy.  Therefore, section 12 is very important.<\/p><p>Section 15 amends section 15(4)(<i>a<\/i>) of the principal Act to provide a role for the authority in relation to the training, powers and duties of reserve members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is another group of people who are making a major contribution, and some of them join the mainstream Garda service.  If people want to volunteer and give their time, it is important we provide them with proper supervision, regulation and training.  If they are that interested and dead keen, we should encourage them.<br\/><br\/>Section 16 substitutes a new section 17 of the principal Act to require the authority to establish a code of ethics for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within 12 months of its establishment.  It is important we get into this immediately.  The code, or specific provisions of the code, will apply with any necessary modifications to the civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 16 deals with the issue of civilians working in the police service.  We need to free up garda&iacute; and develop and trust civilians to get on with the bureaucracy of running a police service.<br\/><br\/>We are talking about trust, accountability and proper supervision and regulation.  In my world, as any good garda on the ground will say, one does not get trust from a community; one earns trust.  In the 1980s, the drugs squad in the north inner city went out and earned the trust of the local community.  The current Commissioner was part of the unit and I knew many of them.  There was a major problem with drugs during the heroin epidemic in the 1980s.  The young members of the drug squad went into the most disadvantaged areas, worked with the families and earned the respect of the local community.  We must not be ashamed to say that old-fashioned public service earning respect is something of which we can be very proud.  This is very important.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned the drugs issue because, in this debate on reforming the Garda, we must acknowledge that we have a crisis and that a major addiction problem is leading to much crime, including &quot;petty&quot; crime.  I do not describe any crime as &quot;petty&quot;.  If a drug addict breaks into a senior citizen's house, it is not a petty crime.  Recently, in my constituency, I met a lovely senior couple whose house was broken into and much of their jewellery and a small amount of cash was taken.  Although it was deemed a small crime, to the family it was not a petty crime.  It was also drug related.  We need to broaden our minds.  The justice committee is examining many drug related issues.  We visited Portugal recently, where we saw the emphasis on health rather than on the criminal justice system.  The idea, again, is prevention.  When dealing with the drugs issue, we must have a broader mind.<br\/><br\/>We have the more serious issue of the gangland crime and killings that are happening in our city.  Over recent years, human life has become very cheap in Dublin city.  It is frightening that people can be shot down for owing a drugs debt of &euro;1,500 or &euro;80, and the dealer has got another unfortunate to do the crime because he owes &euro;1,000.  We must focus on this and we need the Garda to focus on these particular people.  I also have concerns about the power of gangland leaders in society.  People who live in nice, smug, wealthy areas do not understand that a gangland leader living in a community can dominate the whole community, threaten families and dominate whole streets.  I have seen it at first hand.  People who are afraid to go to the Garda about certain people have come to my clinics and when I talk to the garda&iacute;, I raise the issues.  The people will not come to the Garda because they fear they will be burned out, shot and killed.  We must deal with gangland crime very strongly and we must devise new, radical ideas to assist the Garda and develop services.  The Oireachtas justice committee is doing this.  We are working very closely on a report and will, hopefully, publish it before Christmas.  We will bring recommendations to the Minister and I hope she will listen to them.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is dealing with the issue of knife crime.  It is unacceptable.  I do not buy people carrying knives.  I do not accept it.  Anybody with such a dangerous weapon in a civilian or social place should be nicked and jailed, with no debate.  We need to have trust and confidence in policing.  I will say something unpopular: we must be very careful about political policing.  My colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, has raised it.  We must be very careful that politicians stay out of policing and garda&iacute; stay out of politics.  We are going down a dangerous road, given some of the statements and activities I have heard about.  The Minister must be very careful not to politicise the police force, who are public servants and serve the public.  We must be very careful when people put on a red light and there is a warning.  We are talking about democracy.  Regardless of whether one agrees with somebody, everybody has the right to peaceful and democratic protest, in any democracy, and I emphasise &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo;.  We must be very careful we do not get involved in any kind of political policing.<br\/><br\/>We must be careful regarding the standards of certain police officers who leak stories to the media about D&aacute;il Members such as Deputies Mick Wallace or Clare Daly, because they disagree with them.  It is unacceptable, regardless of what people think of political views.  We all know it has happened, and we have dealt with it.  Recently, we had a debate on the Fennelly interim report on policing, the Garda Commissioner and other issues.  We must be very decisive and strong to defend our democratic values and ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keep their noses out of politics and the politicians keep their noses out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is very important.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned community policing and crime prevention and I have pointed out that we need to deal with these issues.  I mentioned gangland crime and we had a major debate on legally and illegally held weapons in Ireland.  It is a modern situation and we must be very careful.  We must ensure that anybody who has a legally held shotgun or rifle is a responsible person.  We cannot give out permits and permission willy nilly.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 of the Bill amends section 21 of the principal Act to enable the authority to approve, with the consent of the Minister, the three-year strategy statement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 19 is common sense, given that, when one discusses a strategy, one refers to plans and a three-year programme for the management, structure and strategy statement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If we are discussing accountability and public service, we must have issues such as those in section 19 implemented.  We cannot allow the service to go stale, given that if it does, issues come in that cause many difficulties regarding it.  I welcome to the House the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, Deputy Stanton.  We have done much work cross-party work on many of these issues.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 amends section 27 of the principal Act to enable the authority, as well as the Garda Commissioner, to make arrangements to obtain the views of the general public about matters in relation to policing services.  Before making any such arrangements, the Garda Commissioner will require the approval of the authority.  Section 25 is all about accountability, transparency and involving the public.  If we want to involve the public and have a police service that has the public's trust and respect, section 25 is the way to go.  I warmly welcome the section.  The views of the public about policing services matters can be very valuable.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has received such submissions.  People came in and made statements on drugs and gangland issues.  They gave a community view and sensible proposals we can bring to the Minister.  We can bring our recommendations.  We will not blind the Minister with science.  We will bring six to ten good, sensible recommendations representative of all our committee and we urge the Minister to consider them seriously.<\/p><p>Part 6 of the legislation contains five sections - sections 39 to 43 - and amends Chapter 8 of Part 2 of the principal Act relating to the appointment and secondment of personnel between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I have very strong views on these sections, which I welcome.  We need more North-South co-operation .  My personal option, in the context of the run-up to the 1916 commemorations, would be to have an all-island police service - I am trying to get away from the word &quot;force&quot; - some day.  At the moment, such a service does not exist on this island.  I think there is huge potential for good and sensible co-operation in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Section 40 of the Bill amends section 53 of the principal Act to allow the authority, with the approval of the Government, to approve the secondment of members of the PSNI to a rank in the Garda not above assistant Garda Commissioner and not below superintendent.  The authority will be able to terminate such secondments with the approval of the Government.  Section 41 provides a role for the authority in the procedures to deal with breaches of discipline by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded to the PSNI.  These sections of the Bill will enable the PSNI and the Garda to work closely.  We need to have closer co-operation.  Many of the reforms that were introduced in the North would be very worthwhile here as well.<br\/><br\/>I assure the garda&iacute; on the ground, who can sometimes be a bit sensitive when one speaks to them, that this is not about having a go at them.  It is about having public servants in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will serve the public and enjoy the trust of the public.  If garda&iacute; have the respect and trust of the public, they will get more support and more co-operation.  I firmly believe this would lead to less crime in society.  That is the important thing.  Criticism and debate are good for democracy and for a reformed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The good men and women of the Garda on the ground who have a sense of public service will not be afraid of reform and change.  As we wait for that reform and change to happen, the members of the Garda will continue to deserve our support and respect.<br\/><br\/>Section 62N, towards the end of the Bill, will require the authority to prepare a strategy statement.  This is another example of the onus being put on the authority to do things.  I have a single small whinge in this context.  This wonderful Government is great at talking about the chaos in the Opposition's figures and numbers.  However, I note that the explanatory memorandum concludes:<\/p><blockquote>The proposed arrangements under the Bill will provide for a new oversight regime for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Currently, it is not possible to quantify the full extent of the resources that will be required and the matter is being actively pursued. <\/blockquote><p>We need to have the sums in relation to this authority.  We need to have the figures.  The Government is always coming after the Opposition by saying that we need to get our figures and asking us for accountability etc.  I suggest the flaw in this Bill is that it is a little open-ended.  We need accountability.  We need to have an idea of approximately how much this policing authority will cost.  If we are going to provide services, we need to know the cost of them as well.  I firmly believe the sustainable economy that is necessary should deliver services in a fair and equitable manner.  That is the way forward for this country.<br\/><br\/>Overall, I welcome the legislation.  There are many things that I would like to add to it.  If we implement many of the recommendations, a whole breath of fresh air will come into the policing service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400027#Z00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443099000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400029#BB00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443099000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which did some pre-legislative scrutiny on this legislation, I should have spoken earlier in this debate.  I apologise for being unable to do so.  I was detained elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, policing is an important matter.  The more I look at it, the more I am impressed to note the huge myriad of tasks performed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as our police service.  Garda&iacute; are called out for all kinds of activities.  They deal with traffic and all kinds of crime and public order issues.  They look after public events.  They do everything and anything one can think of.  We owe them an awful lot.  I acknowledge Deputy Finian McGrath's suggestion that we need to start thinking more about a police service rather than a police force.  I think that is a crucial mind change that we need to bring about.<\/p>  <p>  When the joint committee was asked to do some work on this legislation, it decided to consult in Scotland and Belfast.  I thank the authorities in Northern Ireland and Scotland for facilitating us and meeting us.  We are establishing a new authority, but we must bear in mind that we already have GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda Commissioner, the management team in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister and the Oireachtas committee.  There are six bodies or groups involved here.  The Department is involved as well.  It was emphasised repeatedly in Scotland in particular that it is important for all of these groups and organisations to work together in a professional manner and have good professional relations.  That does not mean there will be no tensions between them; possibly, there should be constructive tensions in this area.  I call on the management of all of these organisations to ensure, as a priority, that there are proper professional working relationships between them.<\/p>  <p>  It has struck me over the years that the role of the Garda Commissioner has possibly been a lonely one up to now.  Many decisions have rested with the Garda Commissioner, who has been responsible for many things.  One of the things we picked up in Scotland and in Northern Ireland is that the authorities there work in a way that oversees the work of the police, but also supports the work of the heads of the policing services in both jurisdictions.  I would like that to happen here as well with the advent of the new authority.  I believe it should work to support the work of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  The committee recommended that the authority should be responsible for promotions above the rank of chief superintendent.  The Minister has gone further by making it responsible for promotions from superintendent up.  I welcome that.  I call on the Minister to ensure the authority has a responsibility to oversee all promotions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including to the ranks of sergeant and inspector etc. and is empowered to do so.  This is crucially important.  I do not feel the current promotion arrangements are satisfactory.  I do not have time to go into the details, but I am not too happy with them.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's clarification in her speech that the authority will be established in shadow format initially.  This was recommended by the joint committee.  The Minister might let us know how long that will take.  It was emphasised to us that it is very important for this to be done.  The authority should not go live, as it were, until it is ready to do so.  If it goes live too quickly, teething problems could arise and other things could go wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that a code of ethics will be established and put in place.  I welcome the extensive consultation that is to take place with various bodies in respect of that.  That process is open-ended.<\/p>  <p>  A number of matters arise in the context of the proposed new section 62S of the Bill.  It provides that the chief executive who is to be appointed \"shall, at the request in writing of [an Oireachtas] committee, attend before it to give account for the general administration of the Authority.\"  I think we need to go further than that.  This provision should apply not just to the \"general administration\" of the authority, but also to the work, policies and procedures etc. of the authority.  I think we need to widen that out.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention another aspect of this section, which appears as a default in many Bills.  I am aware that it has been taken out of some legislation.  Section 62S(9) provides that \"in carrying out duties under this section, the Chief Executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.\"  We might need to soften that a bit.  I suggest it needs to be more openly provided for that when the chairman of the authority comes before the Oireachtas committee, he or she should be able to have an open discussion with members of the committee.  I think that would be quite important.<\/p>  <p>  The role of information technology in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is another issue that arises in the context of this legislation.  I welcome what the Minister said in her speech in this respect.  We need to expand on our efforts in the area of numberplate recognition.  As the Garda Inspectorate said in its report earlier in the year, there is a particular need to expand the role of information technology.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of security is a sensitive one.<\/p><p>The Bill actually manages that quite well in that it recognises that the authority must take note of it but that, ultimately, it is a matter for Executive, and under the Constitution that is the case.  I also welcome the fact that the authority can call on GSOC or the Garda Inspectorate to carry out investigations and inspections as required, which is important.  I am not clear whether, if such a call is made, those bodies are obliged to do so, and perhaps the Minister will clarify that point.  <\/p> <p> On the issue of civilian staff, I welcome the fact that a lot of garda&iacute; are freed up by the hiring of civilian staff and I note that the authority will be responsible for the appointment of such staff over the rank of chief superintendent or equivalent.  However, the issue of civilian staff is one that we must revisit, and perhaps both the authority and the Minister will do that.  Redress of wrongs, for instance, is something that arises.  I asked a question recently about the number of civilian staff who have asked to transfer out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I was not able to get a response.  My information is that quite a number have sought a transfer and I am quite concerned about morale, procedures, practices and protocols in that regard.  That is an issue that we must examine further.<\/p> <p> Garda morale is very important and is something of which the authority should take cognisance.  Perhaps we should include that somewhere in the legislation as part of the remit of the authority.  Another issue which arises frequently is the number of garda&iacute; being assaulted while on duty.  I have called recently for serious sanctions to be put in place in this context because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of a number of State bodies whose members put their lives at risk for all of us.   If a garda is seriously injured on duty it is incumbent on us to ensure that the message goes out that this is not acceptable.  Every sanction available to us should be used, including the withdrawal of social welfare payments.  I do not see why we should be paying people to assault garda&iacute;.  It is a very serious matter.  Furthermore, if a garda is injured on duty, one way or another, we should put in mechanisms to ensure that adequate compensation is provided.  I know legislation is due in that regard and I urge the Minister and the Department to fast-track it.<\/p> <p> I could say a lot more on this legislation but my colleague wishes to contribute.  We have done a lot of work on it already and I know the Bill will return to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality shortly.  I commend the Bill to the House and thank the Minister and the Department for the work they have put into it to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400029#BB00400","speaker":"978","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I commend this Bill to the House and welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality is in the House today for this debate.  The fact that the Minister is establishing a new independent policing body is extremely important.  It will enhance the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose members do fantastic work on the ground, and it all comes back to policing services on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I want to draw the Minister's attention to issues that have arisen in my own constituency of Limerick in recent weeks, and particularly in rural east Limerick, an area that I represent.  Mr. John O'Donoghue suffered a heart attack when a burglary was being committed in his home.  He was living in Toomaline, Doon, and his death has shocked the community in the greater Doon, Cappamore and Murroe areas of east Limerick.  Burglary should be tackled with a three-pronged approach.  Number one, it is an issue of policing, and this is particularly true in east Limerick and the villages of Cappamore, Doon, Murroe, Pallasgreen and Oola.  Historically, Oola and Doon were under part of the Tipperary district, which is geographically much closer, but with the realignment of geographical areas, they are now under Bruff, which is a longer distance away, with the main district headquarters based in Bruff itself.  This is a problem that the Minister inherited from the previous Administration, which closed Templemore in 2009, resulting in no Garda recruitment for several years.  I very much welcome the fact that the Minister has now fast-tracked Garda recruitment in the last year, with 550 new recruits in Templemore.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister has made a commitment to continue recruiting new garda&iacute; in the coming years.  Indeed, I would urge that, finances permitting, the numbers be increased.  Due to a combination of garda&iacute; being out sick and retiring, east Limerick in particular is down in terms of the number of garda&iacute; on the ground.  I would like to see extra garda&iacute; in east Limerick.  There is a need for at least one or two additional garda&iacute; on the ground.  I have spoken to the chief superintendent in Limerick and acknowledge that the garda&iacute; are doing fantastic work on the ground.  I would hope that extra garda&iacute; can be deployed to the Limerick district and particularly to the east Limerick area, encompassing Oola, Doon, Cappamore, Murroe and Pallasgreen.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be bringing the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 before the House next week, which I very much welcome.  Data shows that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of criminals.  That is borne out both anecdotally and in fact.  The aforementioned Bill needs to be very strong, with increased sentences for repeat offenders and a tightening up of the bail laws.  I will be involved in the debate on the legislation next week and I feel we must send out a strong message to burglars that if they are caught they will serve serious time and may face the withdrawal of their social welfare benefits.  In recent weeks I have met people in the rural and urban areas of east Limerick whose houses have been broken into.  In many cases they are elderly people living on their own.  Burglars are targeting jewellery and cash at the moment and in many cases they are specifically targeting the elderly.  When one meets such burglary victims they speak of the invasion of privacy, their loss of confidence and the fact that homes they have bought or built and lived in for many years have been violated.  It is just not on, and that is why I welcome the forthcoming legislation.  It needs to be very strong in telling burglars that if they are caught they will pay.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that a review is currently under way of the regulation of cash for gold businesses.  While there are lots of respectable jewellery shops in operation, cash for gold businesses mean that burglars are targeting gold.  The regulation of such businesses is not tight enough.  Jewellery is being stolen and brought to certain premises and is gone within a couple of days, effectively.  We must regulate this area by requiring formal identification, thus enabling goods to be traced back.  Otherwise, the job of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is virtually impossible because they cannot trace the origin of stolen goods.  That legislation needs to be fast-tracked.  While I accept that there may be difficulties with regard to legitimate businesses, that should not deter the Government from enacting legislation which ensures that if people steal goods they will be tracked down and put in jail.  It is very simple and I am very strong on this issue because of the people I have met.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer again to the issue of extra garda&iacute; on the ground.  I live in Castletroy, which is an urban area.  There have been numerous burglaries there recently, in many cases involving elderly people.  The key issue is that we need garda&iacute; on the ground who know their beat.  It comes down to manpower.  I understand that the Minister is working against the backdrop of no Garda recruitment since 2009.<\/p><p>That decision should not have been made.  People strongly value law and order.  Everyone should be able to sleep at night without fear of a break-in.  I know of elderly people who will not go home or cannot sleep at night because of this fear.  I know people with businesses in rural villages who close their business at 10 p.m. because they are afraid their premises will be burgled or visited by people who will cause them hassle.  My primary role is to represent people in Limerick city and east County Limerick and I am sending out a message, loud and clear, that people have had enough, especially elderly people living on their own.<\/p> <p> The legislation to be introduced next week is a great development.  I will peruse it to ensure it covers all bases.  Persons engaging in burglary must know they will serve time for the crime.  Victims must be placed at the centre of the system and have their rights vindicated.  People must not be afraid to go to sleep at night.  Deterrents must also be introduced.  For example, burglars would be deterred if stolen goods could not be off-loaded quickly and without trace.  Proper tracing mechanisms are needed and regulations must be introduced for cash-for-gold shops.  I have met people who have had wedding and engagement rings stolen.  Such items are extremely precious to people.  Burglars are targeting elderly people in urban and rural areas. <\/p> <p> I hope the Minister receives financial support in the upcoming budget to allow her to invest additional resources in Garda recruitment.  She must be able to increase the number of recruits in Templemore and deploy garda&iacute; on the ground.  A minimum of one garda is needed in rural east Limerick covering the areas of Cappamore, Doon, Murroe, Pallasgreen and Oola.  This would provide assurance that burglars would be tracked and garda&iacute; on the ground would observe exactly what is happening.  First and foremost, however, is the need to place victims centre-stage.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill, which encapsulates what policing is all about.  I have spoken about local issues but this is an urban and rural issue.  Garda&iacute; must be visible on the ground in rural east County Limerick and additional garda&iacute; must be deployed throughout Limerick city, including in areas such as Castletroy, in order that people feel safe. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400030#CC00200","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443100200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I welcome the decision of the Minister to establish an independent policing authority.  This step is long overdue and while I do not underestimate the challenges it will pose and have some concerns about the Bill, it is a welcome development overall.  This debate provides us with an appropriate reminder, if one were needed, of the sequence of scandals and reports which have led us to this point, the most notable of which have been the Guerin and Toland reports and, most recently, the interim report of the Fennelly commission.  All of the events which led to these reports and their findings are matters of deep and existential concern which strike at the heart of our democracy.  If we cannot have faith in the ability of the police or the security of the State and if we cannot have confidence that the duties of the police force and justice Minister will be conducted in an efficient, transparent, honest and open fashion, our democracy has a serious problem.  Good administration and management of justice and security go to the core of democracy in all states.<\/p>  <p>  The policing authority has been a long time coming.  A proposal to establish one has been on the table since the summer of 2014 and, as I indicated, I welcome its establishment.  However, I note a tendency at the highest levels of Government to point to its imminent arrival as if it will solve all the problems in the justice system and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such an assumption would be wrong because a policing authority is only part of the solution and anyone who believes otherwise is seriously mistaken. <\/p>  <p>  The fundamental question facing us and the Minister in performing her tasks is whether the establishment of a Garda authority will restore public confidence in the national police force.  Following recent events, there is no doubt that public confidence in the Garda is at an all-time low.  In 2014, the Toland report recommended that \"The Minister for Justice, through the Department, needs to hold An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na accountable as a critical and resource intensive public service, while respecting their operational independence\".  I fully acknowledge that this is difficult and a tricky balance to strike.  Previous speakers referred to the need for the concept of public service to be instilled at the heart of policing and I fully endorse that sentiment.<\/p>  <p>  It has been 15 months since Mr. Brian Purcell left his position as Secretary General of the Department and he has not yet been replaced.  How can members of the public have confidence in the Department's ability to hold the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na accountable, as required by the Toland report, when the Department is unable to fill one of its key leadership positions?  This is a cause of significant concern and must be addressed by the Minister as a matter of absolute priority and urgent importance. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister informed the House that one of the changes that has taken place in the Department in response to the Toland report is that she now formally meets her Secretary General on a monthly basis.  I find it hard to understand that any Minister could, would or should run a Department without meeting his or her Secretary General much more frequently than monthly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400031#DD00200","speaker":"1204"},{"type":"speech","time":1443100200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>We meet almost daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400031#DD00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1443100200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>In fairness to her, I fully accept that the Minister did not assume the justice portfolio until just before the Toland report was published.  Regular meetings should be standard practice in all Departments.  From my experience, that is not always the case.<\/p>  <p>  If the position of Secretary General is occupied on an interim basis, what value are these meetings in the context of developing a long-term strategic direction and vision for the Department?  I accept that the absence of a long-term permanent occupant of the position places the Minister in a difficult position, but the matter must be addressed urgently if the Department is to undergo the root and branch reform that has been promised and which was recommended by the Toland report.  The public deserves this reform.  The current scenario and absence of a leader is illustrative of a Department which is viewed by members of the public, in the words of Kevin Toland's review group, as being beset by a \"closed, secretive and silo driven culture.\"  Mr. Toland's report also found \"Significant leadership and management problems\" and \"Ineffective management processes and structures to provide significant leadership and management oversight to key agencies both to hold them accountable and to ensure their effectiveness is maximised.\"<\/p>  <p>  The Toland report has been strongly corroborated in the past fortnight by the interim report of Mr. Justice Fennelly, which again exposed a complete absence of efficient communication and transparency in the Department.<\/p><p>This is an issue of significant concern in a modern, developed democracy.  The question I ask of the Minister, which she will no doubt endeavour to answer, is this: who is leading this promised root-and-branch reform of the Department?  Without a permanent Secretary General of the Department, it is very hard to see how it can happen.<\/p> <p> I note that Deputy Niall Collins earlier expressed his hope that the Bill will maintain current levels of public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On this point, I disagree.  As I said at the outset, current levels of public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are very, very low.  It is incumbent upon the Minister, her Department, her Secretary General, when he or she arrives, and the Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, to show leadership by taking active steps to restore a relationship of confidence between the Irish public and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will take time.  Deputy O'Donnell has highlighted very clearly the major issues of concern, which I accept are absolutely acute in rural Ireland.  However, they are not exclusive to rural Ireland.  They exist throughout the country.  There is huge concern, particularly among elderly people and people living alone.  They feel isolated and have lost confidence in the policing of the State.  That is partly because of the scandals that have emerged but also because of the resourcing issues in rural Ireland.  These are significant challenges that face the Minister, and I wish her well, genuinely, in trying to tackle them.<\/p> <p> An issue has come to light in recent weeks which really illustrates that things have not changed and that the culture that led to the vilification of whistleblowers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na just 18 months ago is still there.  The problems and that culture are still there.  Recent whistleblower revelations show that many of the most serious cultural problems still exist and have not been rooted out, despite lofty statements by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister.  We saw a very recent case in which two whistleblowers found that when they made complaints about a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the person within the force assigned to investigate was actually connected to the person complained about.  That is completely inappropriate and shows that the systems are not changing.  With those systems, unfortunately, the culture remains largely unchanged.  This is something that must be prioritised.  It will require a huge effort and co-ordination between the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the new policing authority.  It is imperative that this culture is rooted out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; otherwise, the public will not have confidence in its ability to discharge its duties.<\/p> <p> A further question that arises is the following.  What aspects of this Bill would have stopped the events described in the interim Fennelly report from happening?  The sacking of the Garda Commissioner was a clear abuse of power.  It was an abuse of power for cynical, self-preserving and base political reasons and nothing has happened in relation to it.  The Government has closed ranks and denied any wrongdoing and there is no facing up to the very clear findings in the Fennelly report and the huge contradictions in the evidence given by the various people who surrounded the hazy events in which the Garda Commissioner was constructively dismissed.  Given that An Taoiseach, supported by his Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Justice and Equality, continues to stick to the barely credible version of events which purports that Martin Callinan retired from his position entirely of his own volition rather than at the behest of An Taoiseach, it is clear that the events of March 2014 could easily be repeated, notwithstanding the contents of this worthy Bill.  That is a matter of grave concern.  What aspects of this Bill or a new Garda authority would address the highly worrying state of affairs that allowed the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan, to destroy between eight and ten bags of documents on the day of his resignation?  That is something the Minister must address urgently.  A decade ago, the Morris tribunal recommended specifically the introduction of sanctions for the destruction of any papers or journals by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This recommendation remains utterly not implemented.  That sits in neat parallel with the failure of the Garda Commissioner to respond in any meaningful way to my letter of complaint in relation to Mr. Callinan's destruction of such a substantial number of documents.  The Minister has been very quiet on this - disappointingly so.  She has the power to launch an inquiry into what happened to that documentation to establish what was contained in it and whether it included sensitive materials pertaining to cases that the former Commissioner was involved in or aware of.  It is essential that the Minister confront the issue and recognise that changes such as those proposed in the Bill will not achieve anything if they are not accompanied by cultural changes in her Department and within the police force, as outlined in the Toland and Guerin reports.  We have a long way to go before those recommendations are implemented.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's commitment to having a debate in the House on the appointment of the members of the Garda authority and to require a resolution of both Houses to make such appointments.  However, it is regrettable that such parliamentary oversight of a State body is an anomaly in the context of the Government's failure to fundamentally and substantively reform the way in which appointments to State boards are made.  That remains the case.  Nothing has really changed.  The establishment of the Public Appointments Service has not removed the influence of political patronage from the appointment process across the board and the Government continues to repeat the cronyism of its predecessors.  The slight anomaly in the legislation which allows the Government to make the initial appointments to the first board is a mistake.  The Minister should start as it is intended to go on.  It should be a completely open and transparent process in which people apply, are selected completely independently of the Government and are then ratified or otherwise by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That would be a much better way to start.  It would be a better start for the authority itself and would lend credibility to the Minister's stated intention of having an completely independent policing authority.  That slight caveat in the legislation is a shame, and perhaps the Minister might consider accepting or putting down an amendment on Committee or Report Stage to change that.<\/p> <p> Finally, I turn to political involvement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is something that has been deeply controversial in the last number of years.  The issue of the authority's membership forms part of a wider issue raised by the Bill - namely, the role of politics and politicians in the administration of policing.  It is clear from the proposed legislation that the Government will retain a role in policing, most notably in its capacity to appoint or remove a Garda Commissioner and in its appointment of the members of the authority.  There is no easy answer to this.  I mean that genuinely.  A balance must be found between depoliticising policing and maintaining democratic accountability in the area of justice.  In the case of the HSE, we have seen an utter failure to achieve that balance.  The lessons of the HSE underscore the dangers or potential risks of removing the administration of a major arm of Government from the direct control of a Minister and placing it with an outside authority.  The Minister must be really cognisant of this, as must all of us as parliamentarians, as the Bill goes through the Houses and as we review its performance over the coming years.  It will not be acceptable for a Minister to come to the Chamber, as we have seen with successive Ministers for Health, and say \"It has nothing to do with me; it is a matter for the policing authority.\"<\/p><p>It is essential that the Minister of Justice and Equality remain a central figure in terms of being accountable to the House and, therefore, the people for policing policy and the administration of justice.  It is a balancing act.<\/p> <p> I am concerned that the fingerprints of the Labour Party are evident in the Bill, given the bizarre obligation of the new authority to consult trade unions in the formulation of a code of ethics for the Garda.  It is unclear whether a trade union could have a meaningful role in this process, but the unions' inclusion under section 16 once more reminds us of their disproportionate influence over the affairs of the Government, most recently demonstrated by their shameful exclusion from the requirements placed by the Minister, Deputy Howlin's, lobbying Act.  This shows that there is one rule for every other organisation and a special rule for trade unions, obviously at the behest of their friends in government.  It is bizarre and disappointing that such vested interests continue to wield influence over all aspects of governance, notwithstanding the promise of a democratic revolution just four and a half short years ago.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to take into account the legitimate issues that have been raised about the Bill by Deputies on all benches.  Deputy Stanton, the Chairman of the justice committee, made a number of pertinent points.  His committee has given great attention to the Bill and made significant recommendations, some of which have been included in the Bill but many of which have not.  I hope that there will be genuine engagement by the Minister.  It is in everyone's interests that we restore confidence in her Department and the Garda and restore the people's faith in the administration of justice.  It will not be an easy task or be achieved by this Bill alone, but if the Minister is willing to work with Members from all sides of the House so that the Bill does what it sets out to achieve, that is, ensure a strong, robust and independent policing authority that can hold senior levels of Garda management to account and create a genuine sea change in the culture within the Garda, many Deputies will work with her to that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400031#DD00400","speaker":"1204","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443101400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>It is something of an indictment of the Government's handling of the situation in the Garda that, while everything is different, it remains the same.  There has been a sea change over the course of the Government's lifetime in the population's attitude towards the Garda, a greater consciousness and understanding of its role and, probably, a greater demoralisation within the service itself than at any time before.  The issues were not new, having been brewing for decades.  They surfaced initially in the horrendous findings of the Morris tribunal, with the idea of a few bad apples in a part of the country being mooted, until it suddenly became clear that this was not just a case of a few bad apples, but of a systemic problem in the Garda's functioning, the blue wall of silence that resulted in garda&iacute; being set apart from the general population.<\/p>  <p>  A number of activities that I will discuss emerged during the course of this Government's lifetime, and it had the opportunity to do something about them.  Instead of taking that opportunity, we now have a fig leaf, an attempt to derail the public attention that has been placed on this issue.  The genuine demand for a police service that is accountable to the population has been scuppered.  \"Fig leaf\" is the most flattering phrase I will use.  I could be more insulting, but I will not be in polite conversation.<\/p>  <p>  We must consider the Fennelly report because the Taoiseach, in his defence of his role in the sacking of the former Garda Commissioner, pointed to the \"great\" measures that the Government had taken to reform the Garda and highlighted this legislation.  Many people have claimed that the report seems contradictory.  In some ways it is, but it is also an incredibly thorough report put together by an able individual.  The circle can only be squared in light of the terms of reference.  Mr. Justice Fennelly was asked to consider the visit to the former Commissioner's house in the context of the tapes controversy.  Upon considering what happened, though, it is clear that there is no way that the Commissioner jumped because of the tapes.  Ironically, that was one area in which he performed and acquitted himself perfectly well.  He stopped the practice as soon as he was made aware of it, accounted for the tapes, gathered and secured them and sought advice from the Attorney General and Departments.  He was found negligent in his failure to notify the Minister, but he was awaiting information on the matter.  Everything else was okay.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the report that the Commissioner had become toxic and his role was untenable.  That is no news to us, as we had been calling for his departure long before he jumped.  The problem is the manner in which this was done.  The Commissioner had to go because of the major problems within the Garda, which were made public through the heroic stance taken by the whistleblowers.  It might be all well and good now for everyone to bandy around criticisms of the Garda and so on.  Every media report of a problem is readily accepted in the House.  When we first raised such concerns on behalf of the whistleblowers though, they were not accepted.  We were criticised in the media and this House.  How dare we raise a question about the heroic men and women of the Garda?<\/p>  <p>  Everything has changed substantially.  The revelations about wholesale malpractice in penalty point operations blew the lid and proved to people what they had long suspected, namely, that there were problems within the Garda.  This gave many others the confidence to come forward and discuss their problems with the Garda's functioning, including the horrendous cases of injustice that resulted in the formation of the independent review mechanism.  Hundreds of cases have been buried in that mechanism, with people no nearer to achieving justice.  Their issues have been kicked down the road.<\/p>  <p>  The wanton indiscipline in the Garda that Judge Peter Smithwick referred to is still there.  We have a new Commissioner and Minister, but life goes on pretty much the same.  The experience of current whistleblowers is dim.  When a garda complained about a senior garda, information about the complaint was leaked to the latter.  Subsequently, the new Commissioner appointed the person who had leaked the information to carry out disciplinary action on the senior garda, his friend.  One could not make this stuff up, but it is live and current inside the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  People refer to political policing.  Political policing is not about picking on a particular party, whinging about feeling victimised and so on.  It goes hand in hand with capitalism.  It is a system whereby a state relies on the police to promote and defend the interests of the wealthy at the expense of the majority of citizens.  The purpose of this debate is not to whinge about that situation, but to consider how to improve it.  As a result of the great actions taken by whistleblowers during this Government's lifetime, the public has come to understand that this is not the type of police force that they want.  Rather, they want a modern service that operates to human rights standards and is accountable to and serves the community.  This is also what most people who join the Garda for the right reasons want.  It is in everyone's interests that we achieve that end.<\/p>  <p>  A key nugget along the way is the delivery of an independent Garda authority, but that is not what the Government is proposing.<\/p><p>This legislation is an utter insult.  When compared with the Bill introduced by Deputy Wallace that already has gone through Second Stage here, it is incredibly weaker.  That Bill provides for an independent police service but in this Bill, political control over the authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being retained by the Minister.  That unquestionably is a fact.  There have been many fanfares around this issue.  The Taoiseach told Members in March 2014 that this so-called independent policing authority would be up and running by the end of 2014.  Members now are being told it will be up and running by the end of 2015, which is highly unlikely.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that under this Bill, ministerial and Government control of the authority and the Garda is maintained at every turn with perhaps the exception that it can do a bit of CCTV on its own.  However, the authority must consult the Minister on everything else.  The heads envisaged a model in which there was a division of accountability between security and policing work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While accountability is directly to the Minister in respect of security issues, as for accountability on policing matters, on the one hand it is to the Minister alone but on the other hand, sometimes reporting responsibilities on policing matters are to both the Minister and the authority.  Moreover, sometimes they are to the authority, which then is responsible and accountable to the Minister.  It is an absolute fudge.  It is chaotic, it is not clear and is a recipe for blame games and the type of fluthering around that was experienced in respect of the controversy with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.<br\/><br\/>An examination of head 24 really exposes how this Bill does not provide for an independent policing authority.  As the Minister proposes it, the authority can only ask GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner if it believes the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner which would constitute serious misconduct if the Minister consents to that happening.  What is that about?  How in God's name could the authority be considered to be independent if it cannot even investigate the Commissioner without the Minister stating it is allowed to so do?  The Commissioner is remaining under the political protection of the Minister, which was the very nub of many of the problems discerned in the course of the present Government.<br\/><br\/>One talks about consultation in this process and these issues have been raised by the public.  However, the consultation process that was embarked on was an utter sham.  The proposed authority before Members is incredibly weaker than any of the proposals that were put to the Government by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the experts on policing.  It is incredibly weaker than what exists in the North or in Scotland or than what was put together by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  Laughably, in light of what Deputy Creighton stated, it is completely different from what the Labour Party states it thought an independent police authority would be.  This watered-down version is a pale shadow of any of those things.  When Deputy Wallace put together his Bill, which I reiterate has passed Second Stage, we engaged in extensive research and consultation with a massive number of stakeholders in its preparation.  We consulted Justice4All, all the GSOC commissioners, the ICCL, Transparency International and all the academics in this area.  We made lengthy submissions to the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and so on.  The aforementioned Bill is meant to be on Committee Stage but obviously it will be trumped by this watered-down version and I do not believe that to be good enough.<br\/><br\/>It is ironic when Deputy Creighton talks about trade unions, as if the trade unions must be laughing themselves sick to think their agenda has been furthered by the present Administration, when many of their members have been disenfranchised massively by it.  However, the reality is that the Labour Party's proposals on this issue, published in 2014, recommended that the authority would appoint the Garda Commissioner and other senior staff through open competition.  This is not being done in this Bill.  It recommended the authority would hold the Commissioner to account, which has not been done in this Bill and that the authority would prepare a policing plan with measurable targets.  None of these recommendations is in this legislation.  It is a poor step that the Minister would be required to consult the Garda Representative Association, GRA, or the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, which I would not count in any way as trade unions or representative of the decent garda&iacute; inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given the disgraceful conduct of those organisations in trying to stifle transparency and open debate.<br\/><br\/>This legislation fails.  It deals with performance targets and I would have a severe concern if the Government is pushing for target-driven policing on a legislative basis.  Does that mean we will have a repeat of the doctoring of the crime figures that was evident in the Garda Inspectorate report?  The Bill talks about budgets.  The heads provided that the authority would ensure Garda resources were used to maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness, but this now has been changed &quot;to provide advice&quot; to the Minister before each financial year.  That is absolutely meaningless and if one compares it with the real independent policing authority in Scotland, for example, that authority has 13 members.  It is funded from a 10% portion of the overall policing budget and has a budget of more than &pound;110 million, as well as approximately 60 staff.  The authority in Northern Ireland has 20 members, a staff of 55, three directors of service and a &pound;1.2 billion annual policing bill.  In Ireland, we are proposing eight members plus a chairman and half a million euro to set it up.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission gets &euro;6 million and GSOC get &euro;9 million.  As I presume the Minister is not suggesting the new commission will get half a million, how much will it be funded to deliver this new policing board?<br\/><br\/>We can learn from other countries.  Sometimes, there are good examples and we should be repeating what is best in other countries.  We need not reinvent the wheel and under the Northern Ireland Policing Board, a clear primary function of the board there is to hold the Chief Constable and the police service publicly to account in the exercise of their functions, including compliance with human rights standards.  When one scrapes it all away, is that not really what the people want, namely, to have the police force or police service accountable to the population?  However, they are not getting it through this board.  They know they do not get it through the Minister at present.  I do not mean the Minister personally but the ministerial position.  The only way in which to deliver it effectively is through an independent board.  The difference in the North of Ireland is that the Northern Ireland Policing Board has strong monetary and supervisory functions.  It is interesting if one considers the wording of this Bill that there is only one mention of monitoring.  Although it was mentioned often in the heads of the Bill, it has been taken out at this Stage.  It now has been replaced with &quot;keeping under review&quot;, which means an entirely different thing.  Consequently, there is no real reference to supervision in this regard.  Obviously, I do not have time now but I certainly intend to table massive amendments to this legislation and there should be many such references.<br\/><br\/>The key question here is what should it be and I believe that were the Government serious, it would scrap this legislation.  It would return on Committee Stage and examine the comprehensive Bill put together by Deputy Wallace because what should have been is that the role of the Minister, who is maintaining control in this Bill, should be transferred to the authority.  That is the first thing that needs to be done if this is to be a real independent body.  However, that is not being done.  The authority must be able to draw up policing plans, to take account of priorities, identified of course by the Government and the Minister, but to oversee that.  Moreover, the authority must be the body that monitors compliance with those plans as otherwise it is not independent; it is just a complete and utter joke.  In addition, it must have access to a budget.  The authority must have the responsibility for the appointment of the Commissioner, absolutely with the approval and the input of the Minister.  However, the authority should call the shots in this regard and it should have the power to request the Commissioner to retire, particularly given the recent controversies we have experienced.  However, that is not what is being proposed in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>This is really regrettable and represents a serious lost opportunity.  As Dr. Vicky Conway said in one presentation on this issue, GSOC should be in a position to make the Commissioner accountable.  The Commissioner should not be a political appointee and there needs to be wider criteria for disciplinary regulations.  As she says: &quot;An Authority which is not given specific powers such as the setting of policing plans, the determining of budgets and the appointment of the Commissioner, could on the other hand be a retrograde step for Irish policing.&quot;  That is what I consider this Bill to be.  It is not even merely half a good step forward.  It actually is a step back because it is giving the pretence that the Government is doing something when in fact, it is not.  As Dr. Conway stated:<\/p><blockquote>In that scenario [which is the scenario we are now in] we create the semblance of independence and accountability without the reality, just as was done with the creation of GSOC in the last decade.  That would be a disservice to Irish society and to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/blockquote><p>Indeed, we have met many of them and we stand over that statement.  This Bill is a disservice to the loyal members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and citizens of this State.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and all NGOs in this area made submissions on the Bill, all of which have been ignored.  In their view, the authority should have a disciplinary role in relation to senior management.  Given the air of indiscipline that exists within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I believe that is very necessary.  However, that is not being provided for here, although it is in the North.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace spoke earlier about membership of the authority.  The fact that the initial board will be made up of all appointees is a joke and sets the tone for the future.  Membership of the board should include representatives of minority communities and those whose paths cross with the Garda and will be most affected by measures when the Garda do not serve the public appropriately.  <\/p> <p> This is a substantial enough Bill, about which there has been a significant amount of discussion.  There is a genuine desire among the population for something different in this area.  There are many people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who would also like to see something different.  This Bill does not provide that.  It is not even a pale shadow of the heads of Bill which the Government put forward.  It is a diametrically watered down version of the heads of the Bill.  It bears no resemblance to it.  It bears no relation to what exists in the North or in Scotland and it is an insult to the Bill which has already passed Second Stage in this House.  That Bill would deliver an independent policing authority, which is key to ensuring democratic accountability inside the service, and would bring to an end the era of erosion of confidence, in terms of the Morris tribunal and the whistleblower revelations, in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and address the allegations of malpractice, injustice and cover-up culture that prevails in that organisation.<\/p> <p> This legislation presents an opportunity for a clean sweep and a breath of fresh air inside our service but, sadly, it is a lost opportunity and in that, as Vicky Conway said, it does a disservice to all of us.  It is worse than doing nothing; it is a step back. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400033#FF00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443102600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to today's debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, which establishes the new policing authority that is at the core of the Government's reform plans and represents the most far-reaching reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Any detailed reading of the Bill will show that the new authority will have extensive functions, many of which are currently exercised by the Government or Minister for Justice and Equality.  Many functions have been transferred to the new authority.  As I have already outlined to the House, the Bill proposes that the authority will have responsibility for a range of areas.  The previous speaker has completely under-estimated what is in this Bill and does not appear to have read the detail of what the new authority will be responsible for.  It will oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of its policing functions.  It will nominate persons for appointment and will have the authority and power to recommend removal of people right up to the top position.  The previous speaker in particular completely ignored the fact that it is the norm for governments all around the world to have ultimate responsibility for appointment to top level police positions.  That is the reality.  We also have constitutional and executive function considerations to take into account.  It is the case that the police authority in this country, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has responsibility for security and policing.  In drawing up this Bill, all of those factors had to be taken into account.  That is why I said when I introduced the Bill that I believe the appropriate balance has been struck, after careful consideration and having taken account of the constitutional issues.  <\/p>  <p>  A careful balance has been struck between what is the role of a Minister for Justice and Equality and the functions given to the new independent policing authority.  It is an extremely important step forward.  It is a reforming step forward and to deny that is the case is to do a disservice to what is happening here.  Far from this being a disappointment to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the public and NGOs, it is a real opportunity for a new stage of reform in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is landmark legislation in terms of the change, compared with the type of situation that has existed over the decades in terms of the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality or, indeed, a Minister for Justice and Equality.  This legislation is a statement which, I believe, is an extremely important one in terms of transparency, involvement of the public and the independence of the authority.  It provides a real opportunity for the public to know more about policing and provides the Garda Commissioner with an opportunity to speak before the authority, made up of an independent chairman and eight members.  The appointments process in terms of the appointment of those members is already being addressed by the Public Appointments Service.  This Bill presents an opportunity to strengthen Garda oversight in terms of the introduction of the independent forum for the public oversight of policing services in Ireland.  It is a new engine to drive policing reforms.<\/p>  <p>  The reports from the Garda Inspectorate outlined the range of reforms needed.  Nobody is denying that cultural change is needed and that administrative technical oversight is needed.  Nobody is denying that the Garda Inspectorate report did not say that some of those reforms could be implemented immediately, with others being required in the medium or long term.  The Government and I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have begun that process.  I believe the new Garda Commissioner, No&iacute;r&iacute;n O'Sullivan, is also working to that agenda.  I have no reason to doubt that management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to address the issues starkly identified in recent reports as requiring attention.  The new authority is one of the key mechanisms to allow that oversight develop.  Again, this will not happen overnight.  This legislation is a real statement by this Government that we want to see reform, more public accountability and more independent oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is what is being done through this Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  No doubt we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss further the balances that are in the Bill, and balance there must be, because there are constitutional imperatives and issues around executive authority.  To the Deputies who raised some of these issues, including Deputy Creighton, I have no doubt that in the time ahead Deputies will want me as Minister for Justice and Equality and future Ministers to come to this House and to be held to account on policing.  Deputies will want an opportunity to question the Minister of the day as a member of the Government.  They will want to check whether that Minister is fulfilling his or her constitutional role on policing.  Let there be no mistake about it that this will be a requirement in the future.  In developing the independent Garda authority, due note and regard must be taken of that constitutional role.  As I said, the Oireachtas will certainly want to hold the Minister of the day to account in relation to policing.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe that when Deputies spoke about the types of balances they wanted to see in this Bill they meant that a Minister for Justice and Equality should not be held accountable in this House on policing.<\/p><p>There are constitutional limitations on the extent to which it is open to the Oireachtas, by way of legislation, to delegate the Government's ultimate responsibility in respect of policing to another body.  However, we want an independent police authority.  In the provisions, we have had to deal with the various nuances to which I have adverted.  There is a strong role in the Bill, which some Deputies have mentioned, although others have not, for the Oireachtas, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, to oversee the various decisions that arise in respect of the work of the authority, whether they relate to the appointment of the members of the authority or the question of the removal of a commissioner as well as other issues.<\/p> <p> I believe that the balances are in place.  I repeat that this is reform.  It is important reform in respect of the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is certainly going in the right direction in terms of public scrutiny.  It adds to the body of reform that has been undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, me and the Department of Justice and Equality in the past year.  I am grateful for the support that has been expressed by Deputies.<\/p> <p> I intend to enact the legislation.  Indeed, I hope Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will support me in enacting this legislation quickly in order that we can get on with appointing the independent police authority.  Recruitment for the chief executive of the authority has commenced.  The final round of interviews will take place in early November.  Staffing sanction has been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Some &euro;500,000 is in the budget for this year for the initial start-up.  Naturally, in the Estimates this year there will be an independent and appropriate Vote and an appropriate budget.  Of course the Garda authority needs a budget to get on with its work.  As I have said to the House, we have already established a policing authority transition group charged with doing its work.  It began work in May of this year.  The Vote will be established and discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.  The authority has new premises, which is being organised at present.  It is anticipated that the independent chair and her team will be in the new premises in mid-October.  Everything is well under way in the establishment of the new Garda authority.  Given that the decision was taken by Government only last year to establish a new Garda authority, by comparison with the establishment of other independent bodies the process has certainly moved ahead quickly and efficiently.  I look forward to the new Garda authority being established within months.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.  I intend to move some amendments on Committee Stage to sections 19, 44 and 48.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400035#HH00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1443103500,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 62; N\u00edl, 11.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400037#KK00050","aye":["1016","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1031","1093","1099","1006","1101","1037","994","1091","1046","959","1075","1201","1007","1011","1103","957","1014","1085","1047","1009","1076","1106","1097","1033","1012","1021","1110","1023","998","999","1180","1194","1000","997","1038","1026","1034","969","1018","984","1060","1058","1073","971","1081","1035","947","952","1074","1025","970","961","978","1080","1010","948"],"nay":["1190","1192","1206","1050","960","954","1017","1197","1001","953","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015: Referral to Select Committee","time":1443103500,"counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400037#KK00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1443103500,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400037#KK00250","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443103500,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"}]
