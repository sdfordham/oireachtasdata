Accompanying me are two members of our management team, Gear&oacute;id Breathnach, the financial controller, and S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh, the enterprise and employment manager.  I will give the committee an overview of the work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as well as a brief synopsis of the possibilities and the challenges facing us in the future.<\/p><p>  It has been recognised for some time that stabilisation of the economic base through the creation of employment is the best way to preserve the population in the Gaeltacht and that this, in turn, is the foundation for achieving the preservation and extension of the language, which is central to the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies created 611 new full-time jobs last year.  At year end, total employment in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies stood at 7,650, of which 6,969 were full-time jobs and 680 were part-time jobs.  Significantly, 2013 saw the lowest rate of job losses in 30 years in Gaeltacht client companies.<\/p><p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has audited the financial statements of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for the year ended 31 December 2013 under paragraph 18 of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act 1979.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has expressed the opinion that the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with applicable law.  There was nothing to report in regard to those matters upon which reporting is required by exception.<\/p><p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s continued in 2014, and will continue in 2015, to fund a range of enterprise development and employment creation initiatives, with particular focus on aquaculture, fish processing, life sciences, food, tourism and creative enterprises, including media, arts, and language and culture-based sectors.  The language planning process will continue, and a range of community and local development programmes will be supported, which have the objective of upskilling and building capacity at community level in a range of enterprise and language planning initiatives.<\/p><p>  Particular emphasis has been placed on the development of our natural resources, which are found in abundance along the Gaeltacht coastline.  To develop the seaweed industry, for example, significant new investment and the acquisition of new scientific expertise and marketing ability is required.  This was the primary driver of the decision to sell our seaweed processing subsidiary company, Arramara Teoranta, to an investing company which has the resources and the expertise to develop the sector properly and create value added products and new employment in the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s board and staff have the capability and motivation to create more employment and to initiate a language planning process in the Gaeltacht if the appropriate resources are available to us for this purpose.  Specifically, it is possible to create up to 1,000 additional jobs over a period of five years and to increase the use of Irish as a vernacular language by 25% over a period of 20 years with the appropriate budget and the necessary infrastructure being provided, especially high-speed broadband at affordable cost and ready-to-occupy enterprise accommodation, and having an appropriate staff structure in place from 2015 onwards.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the continuing support of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, IDA Ireland, SOLAS and the Department of Social Protection in implementing our enterprise development programme in the Gaeltacht during 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1412846700,"counter":105,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412846700,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1412846700,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

We acquired Arramarra Teoranta from the State in 2006.  The company had been in operation since 1947 processing, milling and drying a particular type of seaweed, <i>ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>, which is found in abundance along the west coast in Donegal, Mayo and Galway in particular, and in County Clare., and supplying the dry weed to processors who added value and, perhaps, many jobs elsewhere.  When we got the company, its infrastructure was deficient and needed much investment and expertise to develop added value products in the locality, which is Kilkieran in west Galway, which is a very strong Gaeltacht but a disadvantaged area with high unemployment.  We thought we would take the raw material and try to develop it, add value to the products and get the company up to speed with regard to the investment required and create jobs locally.  Many jobs depend on the company, in particular the harvesters, who number between 250 and 300 people.  There are also those who transport the weed to the factory.  These were the primary drivers for our decision to add value to this local renewable resource to create employment for all the partners in the business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1412846700,"counter":109,"content":"<p>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s decided to sell it to add value to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00600","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412846700,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh, who is manager of the enterprise and employment division, to provide more detail on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412846700,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We do not use the words \"sale\" or \"sell\".  We never wanted to sell it.  It was not something we wanted to get rid of because it was too important to the area.  We always wanted a strategic partner to develop it to its full potential.  It was not a sale in this sense and we never set out with this purpose.  As Mr. &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in stated, we were given this company in 2006.  The State invested initially in 1947 and the company had moved between various Departments and ended up in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2006.  By 2006 the company was not liquid and in a bad financial state.  It had lost &euro;1.5 million between 2000 and 2006.  It had gone from having reserves of &euro;700,000 in 2000 to a deficit of &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 in 2006.  The company had no money.  It had spent a lot of money on a capital investment programme at the site.<\/p> <p>It was in serious trouble and the banks were looking for their money back.  We were given the shares, with 81% of the shares owned by the Government and 18% of the shares owned by a company called ISP Global Technologies, which had been the sole customer of the company.  ISP Global Technologies had decided in the 2000s that it was no longer interested in Arramara Teoranta.  Local people would collect seaweed and sell it to Arramara, which dried the seaweed before it was shipped to Scotland for the extraction of alginate.  In the 2000s, synthetic alginate came on the market, so it was no longer viable to produce alginate from natural seaweed.  What was probably unknown at the time was that <i>ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>is not the best source of alginate, and if one is seeking to extract alginate from seaweed, there may other variations, such as <i>laminaria<\/i>, that are far better.  The people at Arramara did not know that as it had no science or technology expertise.  It was being used by ISP Global Technologies as a source of dried seaweed, with valued added in Scotland.  With the advent of synthetic alginates, it withdrew from the business.<br\/>We were left with a kind of basket case as a company, if I can use that phrase.  We have much experience in &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta of running companies from a board and strategic level but we did not know anything about seaweed.  As ill-luck would have it, the existing general manager tendered his resignation when we took over the shares and he left in January 2007.  At that time we had a company that was broke and we had to invest money immediately to keep it afloat.  We began to consider how we needed a strategic partner to develop the company.  We started the process in 2007 by putting in a manager to keep the company going.  He did great work in three years, building up a customer base.  One should remember that ISP Global Technologies was the customer, so the company had lost its customer.  The manager did as much as he could from a technology perspective.  We began the process in 2007 that culminated in the sale of the &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta shares in May 2014.  It was not a sale but rather we sought a strategic partner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412847300,"counter":113,"content":"<p>&Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta has decided to seek a strategic partner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900007#F00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412847300,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh"},{"type":"speech","time":1412847300,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Should this not have been put out to public tender?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900007#F00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412847300,"counter":116,"content":"<p>No, not at that point.

There were some interested parties in the companies.  Admittedly, there were parties which were willing to take the company off our hands for &euro;1.  We decided in 2010 to formalise the process and we appointed consultants to seek that strategic partner.  We did not publicly advertise the process because we were trying to keep the company as a going concern.  We did not want to hang a &quot;for sale&quot; sign over the door.  We had employees, harvesters and customers, and we did not feel it would be the proper mechanism in this case.  This was not a fire sale and we wanted to keep the process under our control, so we engaged consultants, who put together nine potential partners.

We indicated the wish to engage the consultants, whose job was to seek partners.  This was approved and the consultants reported to us almost 12 months later, indicating the two companies deemed to meet criteria.  As an executive, we began due diligence with the companies.  We had to meet representatives and see what the companies were doing.  Acadian was one of the companies and Setalg, a French company, was the other.  We got to know these people and wanted them to understand our vision.  This process concerned a State asset and it was not a sale which the company could do with as it wished.  Stakeholders other than the State were involved, although it was the principal shareholder.  They included employees, harvesters and Irish customers.  There were also environmental issues involved.  This was a complicated process and we had a recommendation from FGS.<br\/>In October that year, an Irish company became involved and questioned why it was not part of the process.  When the consultants were asked to take on the job and assembled the list, it asked companies for a list of customers.  The company had only been formed in 2008 and it is a fine high-performance start-up, HPSU, company backed by Enterprise Ireland.  Nevertheless, it had not really come on the radar by 2010.  It was purchasing a relatively small amount of material - approximately 170 tonnes - from Arramara.  Arramara would sell approximately 5,000 tonnes of product, as every four tonnes of wet seaweed weighs approximately one tonne when dry.  The customer in question bought approximately 3% of Arramara's product, so it was not really on the radar.  When it indicated it should have been involved, the company had improved quite a lot and Enterprise Ireland had invested in the company as a HPSU.  Kernel Capital had also made an investment, the company was making good strides and it had some patents.  It had a licence from the Department to harvest <i>laminaria<\/i>.  We met its representatives and decided it should be admitted to the process in the interest of fairness and transparency.<br\/>When this company entered the process, RSM FGS treated it the same way as it had the previous companies, although it had to fast-track the process.  The company made a complaint afterwards that it did not have enough time at this stage.  We were under pressure and the company had 21 working days to submit its proposals.<\/p> <p>By November that year RSM FGS had reported to us and it ranked the company third after the other two companies.

We were faced with a situation where other companies not in the original nine had come along.  One very large multinational company had come along and stated, \"We can do a great job here.  We will take this off your hands.\"  We had certain discussions with it and outlined what the process would be.  We explained that it would be a formal process and that the company would have to go through it.  It stated it was not interested in the process and that it did not do things that way.  It stated we would have to sell the company for what it was prepared to pay and promised great things.  I have no doubt that it could deliver great things as it is a very well known company, but we said we could not do it that way and that it had to be done in a transparent manner.  That company and other similar companies had approached us and made certain statements on what they could and could not do.  At that stage we were faced with a decision, because of the other interests involved, as to whether we would collapse the process and start again or continue with it and go to the next ranked company.  We discussed this with the board in September 2012.  It decided that we would ask Arramara Teoranta to prepare a corporate plan and if that plan showed that it could achieve what we wanted it to achieve from its own resources and ability, we could consider abandoning the sale.  Arramara Teoranta embarked on that process and by January 2013 wrote to me to state it did not have the resources, be they financial, scientific or technological, to do what we wanted to be done.  Therefore, we engaged with Acadian SeaPlants Limited and in March 2013 the board approved the sale of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s shares to that company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900008#G01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh"},{"type":"speech","time":1412847900,"counter":156,"content":"<p>With regard to that deal, what was the issue with harvesting rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900008#G01600","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412847900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Harvesting rights are not an issue.

That network of suppliers to Arramara Teoranta extends to 250 to 300 local people.  Some people cut actively, while some cut for the Christmas period.  The manager we had put in place <i>pro tempore<\/i>came back to us after approximately two years and said, &quot;Really Arramara Teoranta is like a bank.  When people need money, they cut seaweed, bring it to Arramara Teoranta and get money for it.&quot;  That is a weakness also because how does one develop an industry when one is depending on suppliers who only supply when it suits them?  <br\/>There are two issues I should bring to the Deputy's attention in that regard.  During the economic boom, when people could go to building sites in Galway and earn &euro;700 to &euro;900 per week for assisting a bricklayer or whoever else, it was very hard to get seaweed.  We had this manufacturing plant but no supply.  Now - the new owners have said this - the existing generation of harvesters are all people of my age.  The big challenge is to make the industry attractive for a new generation of harvesters who can see that they can make a living from it and live in their communities.  Supply is the issue.  The weed is on the rocks and there is plenty of it, but it is no good unless it is being harvested.<br\/>No harvesting rights were sold because we did not have harvesting rights to sell.  Arramara Teoranta still does not have harvesting rights.

We own it - we are the landlord - so the best value is a multiple of earnings.  Fortunately, through some very hard work, earnings improved under our ownership, despite a very bad period up to 2006.

The Comptroller and Auditor General has cousins in Ring, while I have cousins from Old Parish.  My only question relates to a decision by the then Minister a number of years ago to end the permanent board relationship for smaller Gaeltachts.  As I understand it, there is now a rotating system in place, with one permanent position rotating between the three smaller Gaeltachts, namely, the Ring and Old Parish, Ballyvourney and Meath Gaeltachts.  At the time, the decision was very contentious and it still is within Fine Gael.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to review it.  It is obviously a policy issue and something that was determined by the Minister at the time.  I have always made the argument that the smaller Gaeltachts are the ones that needed representation more than the larger ones.  It never made sense to me that the right to a permanent member on the board of &Uacute;daras would end the right of these three Gaeltachts.  What do the witnesses think of that decision?  Obviously, they do their jobs and probably compensate in many ways.  Do they believe there is a lack of representation for the smaller Gaeltachts because of that decision?  Has the board benefited in any way from it?  Did the decision make sense?  Should it be reviewed?  I regularly receive representations from the Ring and Old Parish Gaeltacht, the most recent of which were related to access to high speed broadband for businesses in the area.  I am concerned that the lack of a permanent board member for the smaller Gaeltachts which are already finding it difficult to keep the Irish language alive among the population will mean that it will go downhill.  Do the witnesses have a view on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900013#M04400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412850900,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We have a very small but thriving Gaeltacht in Ring and Old Parish, as the Deputy said.

That Gaeltacht area is very strong.  The Irish language is very strong among the young people there, which is very encouraging.  We have 130 people employed in our client companies there.  The companies in question are very small.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the major employer is NemetonTV, originally a one person start-up company which is now doing very well.  There have been four or five other start-up companies in the past few years and they hold their own when it comes to board meetings.

The Shannon Development Group financial statements for 2013 cover the activities of Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and two subsidiaries, Shannon Castle Banquets and Heritage Limited and Kilrush Creek Marina Limited.  Shannon Development's core functions in the mid-west region over many years have included industrial and tourism development and management of industrial property.  The group was substantially restructured in 2013, with certain functions being transferred to other public bodies with national remits.  The changes that are taking place are summarised in a diagram in the statement I have furnished to the committee.  The diagram indicates that Shannon Free Airport Development Company's indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment activities have transferred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, respectively.  It also shows that the company's tourism development responsibilities have transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Under the Shannon Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, the residual parts of Shannon Development and Shannon Heritage became subsidiaries of Shannon Group plc.  The diagram shows that the property management activities will transfer to Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited and that the activities of Shannon Castle Banquets and Heritage Limited will transfer to the Shannon Heritage Company as part of the Shannon Group.  Finally, Kilrush Creek Marina Limited is being disposed of by the company.<\/p><p>  Under the 2014 Act, the audit of the financial statements of Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited will no longer be performed by my office.  The 2013 financial statements reflect the changes occurring in the group, including a disaggregation of the group's income and expenditure for the year between the continuing and discontinued operations.  In 2013, the Shannon Development Group recorded a deficit for the year of &euro;1.6 million.  Its income for the year included &euro;10.8 million in rental income from its commercial property assets, &euro;11.2 million from its tourism activities, &euro;5 million in profit on the sale of assets and investments and &euro;5.2 million in Oireachtas and EU grant funding.  The Oireachtas grant funding was provided to cover the costs of grants to industry and exceptional costs of &euro;3.4 million arising from a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme, which was part of the group's restructuring.  Expenditure in 2013 totalled &euro;34 million.  This included &euro;16.7 million in operating expenses, including pension-related costs, depreciation of &euro;5.7 million, &euro;5.2 million in direct property management expenses, &euro;3.7 million in direct tourism expenses and &euro;1.7 million in grant payments.  Some &euro;1 million was incurred in 2013 in costs directly related to the restructuring of the company.  These costs are analysed in further detail in note 10 of the financial statements.  This expenditure is in addition to the redundancy and early retirement expenditure of &euro;3.4 million, which is included under the other headings.<\/p><p>  Shannon Development held a significant portfolio of property assets.  At 31 December 2013, the group held tangible assets with a net book value of &euro;64 million, comprising &euro;51.9 million of industrial land and buildings and &euro;10.9 million of land and buildings associated with its tourism activities.  The net book value of the property assets reflects the effect of significant impairment amounts charged in previous years.  Total asset impairments of &euro;32.9 million were recognised in the 2012 financial statements as a result of a comprehensive valuation of assets undertaken with external professional assistance, conducted as part of a due diligence review prior to the transfer to Shannon Group.  Under the terms of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, the liabilities, duties, obligations and funding of the pension scheme for Shannon Development up to the date of its transfer to the Shannon Group plc will be taken on by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The group&rsquo;s financial statements for 2013 received an unqualified audit opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900016#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1412852100,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Pakey to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900016#R00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412852100,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the Deputies for giving us an opportunity to address the committee.  We have been invited to discuss the 2013 annual accounts for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, or Shannon Development, as it was known until recently.  I would like to set out the context to the changes that have occurred within the company since the Government decided in December 2012 to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and bring it together with a restructured Shannon Development.  Much of last year was spent devising and implementing a major change management programme at Shannon Development to ensure a smooth transition.  This involved employees transferring with their functions to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, or redeploying to Government agencies and the Civil Service.  Other employees chose to exit under a voluntary early retirement or voluntary redundancy scheme.  Employees who were engaged in property activities for Shannon Development become part of Shannon Group plc and are now based at Shannon Airport with the rest of the team.<\/p><p>  Shannon Development has been renamed Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited, trading as Shannon Commercial Properties, and is engaged in commercial property management and development.  Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shannon Group.  Shannon Heritage, which was previously a subsidiary of Shannon Development, remains a subsidiary of Shannon Commercial Enterprises.  After the enactment of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, Shannon Group was incorporated on 29 August 2014.  On 5 September 2014, following the transfer of shares under the Act, the company became a subsidiary of Shannon Group plc.  Shannon Group is a commercial semi-State company comprising four strategic business units: Shannon Airport, Shannon Heritage, Shannon Commercial Properties and the International Aviation Services Centre.<\/p><p>  I will give the committee some background on myself and my management team.  In terms of relevant experience, I was employed by Manchester Airport for 14 years, during which time we established our property business, which has now grown in scope to 1.4 million sq. ft. of logistics and warehousing, 1.5 million sq. ft. of offices and 650,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing space.  Over that period of time, we developed a sustainable business through further airport investment and acquisitions.  When I was employed by a UK airport and property company, Peel Holdings, we invested &pound;80 million in Liverpool Airport and increased traffic levels from 700,000 to 5.5 million passengers per annum, while at the same time developing property assets across the north-west region of England.<\/p><p>  I was appointed as chief executive officer of Shannon Airport on 10 June 2013.  I was subsequently appointed as chief executive officer of Shannon Development on 1 September 2013.  On 5 September 2014, I became chief executive officer of the newly established Shannon Group.  During 2014, in preparation for the establishment of Shannon Group, I began the process of assembling our executive management team.  Mr. David McGarry was appointed chief financial officer of Shannon Airport on 1 February 2014 and subsequently chief financial officer of Shannon Group on 5 September 2014.  Mr. Ray O&rsquo;Driscoll was appointed managing director of the property division of Shannon Group on 23 April 2014.  Ms Mary Considine became the group company secretary of Shannon Group on 5 September 2014.<\/p><p>  Today, Shannon Commercial Properties continues to own and manage over 400 buildings and 2,000 acres of land in over 50 locations in the Shannon region.<\/p> <p>The property portfolio ranges from prime office buildings and multi-let technology parks to engineering, manufacturing, warehousing and logistics facilities.  In addition, Shannon Commercial Properties has a portfolio of fully serviced sites available for sale and development.  The largest business park in the portfolio, which is known as the Shannon Free Zone, is the largest multi-sector business park in the Atlantic corridor.  A 600 acre business park, it accommodates more than 100 companies.  The Shannon Free Zone was established in the 1960s and grew significantly in the following decades, during which it was focused primarily on manufacturing and assembly activities.  Many of the buildings in the zone were constructed prior to 1990 and significant investment is now required to bring it to the standards required in today's Ireland.  <\/p><p> In addition to the Shannon Free Zone, Shannon Commercial Properties owns and manages technology parks in Limerick, Tralee, County Kerry, Ennis, County Clare, and Thurles, County Tipperary.  The company also owns numerous other facilities across counties Clare, Kerry, Limerick, Offaly and Tipperary.  In the current depressed property market, the valuation of many of these properties is significantly less than their initial acquisition and construction cost.  Many of the properties were developed when the company had a regional development remit and constructed in locations to enable enterprises to create employment locally.  <\/p><p> One of my key goals for Shannon Commercial Properties is the redevelopment of our commercial property portfolio in the region around Shannon Airport and other key strategic locations.  We now have a new team in place and we are finalising a development strategy for our portfolio.  As part of this, we have begun upgrading some existing buildings in the Shannon free zone and we are also evaluating redevelopment opportunities for the zone.<\/p><p> In 2013, the Shannon Development accounts recorded an overall deficit of &euro;1.569 million.  This includes costs related to tourism and enterprise activities which no longer form part of the business of Shannon Commercial Properties.  The company recorded a &euro;4 million profit on the sale of assets during the year.  This was generated through the sales of 11 properties, the largest being the sale of land and buildings at the University of Limerick and the sale of a warehouse building in the national technology park, Limerick.  Some &euro;6 million in capital expenditure was invested in property and tourism assets, with the largest investment being spent on revamping King John's Castle.  At the end of 2013, the company was debt free with a cash balance of &euro;12 million, a substantial increase in the &euro;7 million cash balance recorded at the end of 2012.  <\/p><p> To bring the Chairman and members fully up to date with recent developments, the Shannon Group team has been assembled and we have a collective determination to seek out and maximise the potential of all business opportunities and drive growth and profitability in all areas of our group's activities, including Shannon Commercial Properties.  The group is firmly focused on fulfilling our objective of securing a sustainable future for all of our operations and becoming a catalyst for economic growth for the west.  We are developing a five year business plan for the group, which is due to go before the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for his approval in December.  We are here to help the committee and we will be pleased to discuss the 2013 Shannon Development accounts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900016#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Pakey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412852700,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pakey.

They appear to have successfully restructured and put together the various elements to establish the new Shannon Group plc.  I propose to first ask a few questions about the new entity.  It is my understanding that it has been a long-term goal of Shannon Development to have a consolidated entity with a commercial focus.  What are the major challenges facing this new company as it commences operations as a semi-State commercial entity, with a new direction and new principles of operation?<\/p><p>  Shannon Development received some &euro;5.1 million in grants from the State in 2013.  Does Mr. Pakey expect the company to continue to receive State grants now that it is a commercial entity or will it be a stand-alone and profitable commercial semi-State company? <\/p><p>  Mr. Pakey stated that significant restructuring remains to be done in terms of investment.  I note that &euro;1 million was spent on restructuring in 2013.  How much will be spent on restructuring in 2014?  How much has been spent on consultants in restructuring the new public limited company?<\/p><p>  Some &euro;3.4 million was spent on an early retirement and redundancy scheme in 2013.  Given that 33 people took the early retirement and redundancy package, this works out at approximately &euro;100,000 per person, which is a sizeable amount.  The package appears to have been a generous one.  Will Mr. Pakey outline its terms, for example, the number of weeks of salary that were awarded per year of service?<\/p><p>  A major debate is taking place on defined pension benefits.  To what extent did the Irish aviation superannuation scheme operate, if at all, in the Shannon Development arena?  Given that this scheme has a deficit of approximately &euro;760 million, will this have any impact on Shannon Development and, if so, will any liabilities arising transfer directly to the Department?<\/p><p>  On the restructuring, I presume the company will be answerable to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  What oversight role does Mr. Pakey envisage for the Department?  Is there merit in the company continuing to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its representatives continuing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900017#S00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412852700,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I will endeavour to answer each question in turn and see if I am able to answer them all sufficiently.  In terms of what are the new challenges facing the business, there are challenges and, in fact, the challenges are driven out of what brought us together in the first place.  It is fair to say that the companies were brought together under the Shannon Group out of need and this need was driven partly by performance.  For example, in terms of Shannon Airport's performance, it had experienced five years of successive decline in passenger numbers, which has an economic impact and an impact on prosperity.  Similarly, Shannon Development was in need of regeneration and transformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900017#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Pakey"},{"type":"speech","time":1412852700,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Pakey take the view that a commercial entity of this nature was the way forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900017#S00600","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412852700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I would not have joined the company if I had not believed that this was the right way forward for the business.

Clearly, there are good investment opportunities out there.  It is a matter of identifying the right opportunities and stimulating the market.  The biggest challenges are probably related to growth and investment and having a business model that is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  We will not be able to rely on grants.

In terms of my own background, it would be normal good company practice to have the due diligence done.  Following a tender process, we selected the lowest tender which happened to score the highest number of points in terms of the tender evaluation.

That accounts for &euro;260,000.  I will now turn to the rest of the breakdown.  We had other professional fees including taxation advice at &euro;50,000.  Legal costs totalled &euro;170,000.  That covered not only the memorandum and articles of association of a new company and legislation, but also an examination of all the contracts, the change of name and so forth.  There was no legal person transferring with the Shannon Development people so we had to go outside for support in that area.  We had a project manager who cost &euro;50,000.  That totals what might be classified as consultancy or professional services fees.  On the rest of the breakdown of the &euro;1 million, &euro;130,000 is for relocation costs of Shannon Development staff and employees to the new company.  Some of that concerned the IT equipment required and upgrading of some of the tools.  IT costs totalled &euro;130,000.

The impairment exercise was carried out in 2013 and when we were completing the audit of the financial statements for 2012, we recognised it as a post-balance sheet adjustment that needed to be made.  That is why, even though the exercise was carried out in the latter part of 2013, it had an adjusting effect on the 2012 financial statements.  When I saw the impairment and the loss that was recognised in 2012, I did have a concern that a going concern issue might be arising.  We looked in great detail at the impairment exercise.  On the other hand, we were aware of the upside for other properties that was not being recognised.  To a certain extent, it somewhat assuaged our concerns that there was a serious loss that could not be sustained by the company.<\/p><p>  I will not be auditing the 2014 accounts for the new company and do not, therefore, have particular detail on them.  The concern I have for a new company setting up is that it should fully recognise all of the resources being put into it.  I would be more concerned if Shannon Development were not recognising the upside at this stage because that is the base on which one would expect to see a return being calculated.  If the assets were simply taken across without adjusting and revaluing everything, one would not have a sense of their economic potential and what capital should be remunerated.  The treatment, as I understand it from what is being presented, is actually the correct reflection of the economic reality in the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014100900021#W02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1412855100,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his clarification.

The Hungarian parliament accepted, with a two-thirds majority, a new fundamental law in 2011, which came into force on 1 January 2012.  The fundamental law replaced the previous constitution, which was first drafted in 1949 and amended several times, in particular during and after 1989.  Hungary was the last country among the central and eastern European states to introduce a new constitution after the transition and profound political changes in 1989 and 1990.  Redrafting the constitution was long overdue.  During the political transition in Hungary in 1989 and 1990 it was suggested that a constitutional convention be called into session, but ultimately this was shelved.<\/p> <p>In the next two decades, or so, several different propositions and proposals were made to write a new constitution and they required a two-thirds majority in the parliament.  Given the very polarised nature of Hungarian political life, no political party was able to introduce a new constitution or a draft for a new constitution until 2010, when the current coalition Government received a two-thirds majority and was in a position to fulfil what had been on the agenda of all political forces in Hungary.<\/p><p> The fundamental law and its amendments, especially the fourth amendment of 11 March 2014, aroused widespread interest and debate both inside and outside Hungary.  The documents were extensively scrutinised by, among others, the European Commission, members of the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission, the US Department of State in its annual human rights reports, a number of civil organisations and the domestic and international media, with various degrees of expertise and knowledge of the actual texts.  The Hungarian Government continued an extremely intense and extensive dialogue with official and unofficial partners and, when it considered objections valid, it changed or modified laws and regulations.  As a result it may well be that the fundamental law of Hungary is the most widely scrutinised and approved such document in the European Union.  The drafting of the constitution took around eight months during 2010 and 2011 and, ultimately, it was accepted by a two-thirds majority of members of parliament.  It is sometimes noted that no other political forces took part in the process but they voluntarily withdrew from the debate and did not wish to take part in the political process for reasons of their own.<\/p><p> The Venice Commission stated that the new constitution \"establishes a constitutional order based on democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights as underlying principles\".  The Venice Commission approved the constitution and did not find it wanting in terms of basic principles, including the rule of law.  The majority of comments on rule of law in Hungary have centred on electoral law, media regulation, the status of churches and religious organisations and the independence and structure of the judiciary.<\/p><p> I will now address electoral law.  The electoral districts, set by an executive order in 1990, did not change for 20 years despite substantial population shifts during this period.  Thus, the largest electoral district incorporated two and a half times as many voters as the smallest one in 2010.  The new electoral law halved the number of members of parliament and the total is currently 199.  Some 106 members of parliament are elected directly in a first past the post system while the rest can get a mandate on party tickets and through a so-called compensation ticket.  The threshold for parties for sending candidates into parliament is 5% of the popular vote.  The 2014 parliamentary elections were declared fair and open - the observers, including those of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, in some cases missed a larger turnout of minorities, especially the Roma population.  Hungarian electoral law is sometimes criticised for distorting the popular vote in favour of the biggest party but if the Hungarian elections of 2010 and 2014 had been run entirely on a first past the post basis the current coalition would have received between 90% and 95% of seats in parliament.  It cannot be said that the current two-thirds majority system distorts the opinion of the population.<\/p><p> The passing of the new media law in 2010 provoked a heated debate.  However, it should be remembered that the media had criticised the media law of 1995 because it put supervision into the hands of politicians delegated by the parliamentary parties.  The new law broke with the possibility of the direct political influence and entrusted the oversight of the media to a media council, whose members are elected by a two-thirds majority of members of parliament.  Commissioner Neelie Kroes expressed concerns about the concentration of power, which was unique across Europe, and the independence of the media council.  As a result of constructive dialogue, the Commissioner, Ms Neelie Kroes, welcomed changes in media legislation on 26 November 2012.  Media law has been modified three times since 2010, each time in co-operation with the European Commission or the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.  The changes affected the registration of the press and media services and strengthened the protection of information sources and the independence of the media council.  The most recent issue in this area relates to a new advertising tax.  It arises as a consequence of disproportionate revenues from advertisements and the new tax does not affect all the media outlets equally.  Advertising in the media generates &euro;560 million per annum and tax of &euro;4.1 million is paid - this is less than 1% of the revenue generated.  The Hungarian Government wants to remedy this issue and spread the financial burden by taxing media outlets.<\/p><p> There are hundreds of organisations in Hungary that define themselves as religious organisations.  As such, they enjoyed a number of benefits such as tax exemption for the organisation in question, a personal income tax exempt status for officials and so on.  After 2010 the Hungarian Government wished to regulate the field and greatly reduced the number of churches and religious organisations that could still qualify for privileged status.  It was decided they should meet certain criteria and, after modifications of the original law, partly in accordance with a ruling of the Hungarian constitutional court, the new criteria were set out.  A church or religious organisation must have been in operation for at least 100 years internationally or 20 years in Hungary, in which case it must have a membership of at least 0.1% of the total population, or approximately 10,000 people.  In addition, parliament must be given more precise criteria relating to an official church's suitability in promoting community goals, such as education, medical treatment, social services, charities and so on.  Regardless of whether a religious group is recognised by parliament as a church, every religious group is entitled to use the word church in its official name.  Officials from both recognised and unrecognised churches have the same rights and legal protections and their doctrines, internal regulations and statutes cannot be subject to state review, modification or enforcement.<\/p><p> The regulation of the authority and structure of the various members of the judiciary has also been amended - in compliance, for instance, with the observations of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.  Criticisms had centred on the extensive authority of the president of the national judiciary office, which included budgetary and financial management of the courts, staffing, appointments, distribution of caseloads and the ability to transfer cases from one court to another.  The fourth amendment to the constitution incorporated the provisions related to the judiciary into the fundamental law.  The passing of the fifth amendment addressed the removal of the most controversial right of the president of the national judiciary office, that is, the right to transfer cases from one court to another.  On the recommendation of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the president of the National Media and Infocommucations Authority is now to be appointed by the president and not the prime minister, as was originally provided for, while the president and members of the media council cannot be reappointed after the expiration of their nine-year terms, in contrast with the original stipulations.<\/p> <p> Another widely discussed point was the mandatory retirement age for judges and state prosecutors.  Originally, it would have required the introduction of mandatory retirement at the age 60 but ultimately a compromise was hammered out and the new system is to be introduced over a ten-year period, setting the retirement age at 65, that being the oldest age for retirement with pension benefits according to the relevant Hungarian Act on retirement and pensions.  The change will become effective on 1 January 2023.<\/p><p> Finally, the Hungarian Government also dropped an amendment that would have allowed it to cover the cost of any future European Court of Justice fines by levying new taxes.  I wish to conclude the opening statement with a general conclusion.  As might be evident from the statement, and possibly if members have followed the Hungarian constitutional developments, the constitution has been shaped in the past four years in close co-operation with the relevant authorities within the European Union and therefore I would characterise the debate or dispute within the European Union over the Hungarian constitution and the amendments as a family dispute in which each member simply expresses his or her views and they try to hammer out a compromise for the benefit of the two parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014100900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

He spoke about the suggestion as far back as 1989 or 1990 of holding a session of a constitutional convention.  Did that happen in the context of the changes that were introduced in recent years since the government got a two thirds majority?<\/p><p>  Any change to our Constitution requires a full vote of the people.

Deputy Dooley inquired about the protection of minorities, especially the Roma people.  The new constitution pays special attention to the protection of minorities, especially disabled women and children, the foetus and also ethnic minorities.  I remind the committee that it was during the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union that a Europe-wide Roma initiative and programme was introduced in order to integrate the Roma people and give them opportunities for education and work.<\/p> <p> Let me be honest, it is a very difficult issue.  Hungary has approximately 600,000 to 700,000 Roma people. Unemployment is very high among them, which is attributed to their not being able to compete on the labour market with others due to a lack of adequate skills.  Many different programmes have been initiated to try to adopt certain models, even the US Magnet schools.  Once again to be honest, the results have not been adequate.  We must work on it in the future but we also believe that this problem can, to a certain extent, be solved internationally, so we expect European Union advice and assistance to address the problem.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly referred to the liberal state and Mr. Orb&aacute;n's statement which has been very widely discussed.  To a certain extent, it has been misrepresented, especially in the American press.  What Mr. Orb&aacute;n was talking about was the failure of the liberal economic policies.  To put it into context, when the new Government took over in 2010, the Hungarian state was in an economic straitjacket.  We had to go hat in hand to the IMF.  The first Orb&aacute;n Government stepped down in 2002 and for two terms, there was a Socialist Government and Free Democrats Government, which was a liberal Government.  In these eight years, the sovereign debt skyrocketed from approximately 58% of the GDP to 82%.  During the eight years, the current account deficit was always above 5% or 6% but in one year, it was 9%.  The treasury was empty.  What the Hungarian Government and Mr. Orb&aacute;n concluded from this situation was that the so-called liberal or neoliberal economic polices did not work.  <\/p><p> The Hungarian position and that of Mr. Orb&aacute;n can better be described as a Christian emocratic or a social democratic one rather than a liberal democratic one.  These are very different types of approaches but that is how I would characterise this approach.<\/p><p> It is written into the constitution that in addition to rights, there are also obligations and responsibilities which individual citizens have to meet.  The rights and the responsibilities go hand in hand.  One cannot separate the two.  That includes special attention to the minorities.<\/p><p> I would like add one thing in regard to this approach to illustrate it.  Last weekend an American racist and extremist organisation wanted to hold a conference in Budapest.  The Government banned the meeting because of its overly racist attitude.  As a result of banning the meeting, the Government was attacked by NGOs and by the political opposition which said the Hungarian Government had broken the right of free speech and that it should have let this racist organisation organise and have its meeting in Budapest.  The Government's attitude was that the community should be protected from racist and extremist views.  If one has to balance protection of the community and minorities with extremist interpretations of the liberal rights, including freedom of speech, under all circumstances, priority should be given to the protection of the minorities and the community and not to some abstract liberal interpretation of the freedom of speech.  <\/p><p> A question was asked about homelessness and homeless people.  The Hungarian law is clear.  The municipal authorities have the right to assign certain venues and certain neighbourhoods as off limit for people begging or sleeping on the streets, including, for example, sites of world heritage.  At the same time, in order to address the problem of homeless people, the government had quite a number of homes for homeless people built.  More places are at their disposal than registered by the individual municipal authorities.  We should give them the opportunity to have a decent place to sleep and to have some hot food instead of sleeping and begging in the streets.  One could say that an abstract individual right is that if one wants to be a homeless person, one should have the right to enjoy one's right even in the middle of the parliament, although the government states that certain sites are off limit.  Again this is not without precedent.  Members might remember, for example, that the former Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, had a zero tolerance policy in New York.  Perhaps the novelty of the measure created debate.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne referred to the constitutional convention.  The constitutional convention was not organised and held, even though in hindsight it would have been better if it had been held at the time.  Unfortunately, Hungarian political life is extremely polarised.  Polarisation means the political parties treat each other as enemies not as opponents.  As I said, a two thirds majority was required by the old constitution.  There was no consensus to call a new constitutional convention into session.  The first time a political force had gained a two thirds majority was in 2010 and that is why a new constitution was written after 2010 and not before it. <\/p><p> In regard to the judiciary, 260 judges were affected by the judiciary law.  Under the new legislation, the majority continued to serve.  Some preferred to opt for early retirement with compensation packages while one died.<\/p> <p>This is not a problem any more because the legislation comes into force in 2023.  The judges can decide in the next ten years or so what to do.<br\/>I turn to the constitutional court and transparency.  The constitutional court originally had 11 members, which has increased to 15.  The members are elected to the court by a two thirds majority.  It was mostly as a result of a bargaining between the political forces as none of them enjoyed a two thirds majority.  Right now, most of the judges nominated to the court enjoy the support of the governing party.  First, I do not want to prejudge how they would behave once elected because there have been many cases where judges have behaved differently from the way in which they had been expected to behave.  So-called liberal judges turned out to be quite conservative and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I do not want to have parallels from all over the world, but I note that in the USA, it is well known that Supreme Court judges are nominated by the President in accordance with their political outlooks.  A liberal President nominates liberal judges while conservative Presidents nominate conservative judges.  After that, who is going to do what?  Transparency International came to the conclusion that the judiciary was independent, transparent and without political interference.  So far, not a single case has been found of political interference.  That is exactly what the Hungarian expert on Tuesday told this committee.<br\/>Senator Hayden asked why Hungary was the last country.  She touched a raw nerve and has entered dangerous waters because I come from the academic world.  In the university, people are given 90 minutes to talk about certain issues, but I do not want to entertain the Senator with the constitutional history.  The major reason was that there was a deadlock between the political forces and the old constitution required a two thirds majority to change.  Between 1990 and 2010, no political force was able to garner a two thirds majority to initiate a new constitution.<br\/>The question was asked whether Hungary was unfairly treated.  It was not unfairly treated, especially when one considers the various organisations of the European Union.  If one talks about the European Commission, the Council of Europe or the Venice Commission, there was a very professional, sophisticated debate and discussion with Hungary.  It was a different matter sometimes with the press where it was not that informed and emotions were running high.  I separate the expert and the professional side from the press.  To give one example, one of the most prestigious magazines in the world ran a lead article in 2010 by a grand old man of British politics discussing the Hungarian electoral results.  His whole thesis was based on the assumption that certain people running on the Fidesz ticket had racist views.  These people had been kicked out of Fidesz before the election, however, and clearly he missed the whole point.  Nevertheless, that was published in one of the most prestigious and most renowned magazines in the world.  The press was one thing but the family of the parliamentarians and the bodies of the European Union treated Hungary fairly.<br\/>If one has a debate, views will clash, but I emphasise that all disputed issues have been settled for the benefit of both parties.  Mr. Orb&aacute;n and the Government believe a strong European Union needs strong member states.  Whatever he is doing in economic life, he tries to strengthen the European Union because he believes that without strong member states, the EU cannot compete with other centres of power in the world and will lag behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014100900004#C00700","nonspeaker":"H.E.

While there would be a debate within political parties about the cause of that, there is a general recognition within Europe that membership of the EU is based on the need for a general common thrust of legislation and the application of the rule of law.  In the absence of those things, there is a tendency to go outside the rule of law.  The comparisons that have been made with the United States would not necessarily be regarded as relevant in this context.  There are many things that apply in the US that would not be acceptable in Europe.  I am sure there are things that apply in Europe that are not accepted in the US.  The right to bear arms, for example, is a fundamental issue for people in some parts of the US.  The EU would not readily concur with that position.<br\/>How many homeless people are there in Hungary?  How many of them are members of the Roma community?  Why did the blacklisting of certain non-governmental agencies, and the blocking of international aid provided through those agencies, happen?  On what basis did it happen?

It is not justiciable in all cases, but it is certainly there as a headline and as a basis from which to work.

Approximately six months ago, the Hungarian Government concluded a treaty with Russia about the construction of another nuclear power plant block adjacent to the current nuclear power plant, which generates approximately 40% of Hungary's electricity.  If the proposed block is added, that figure will increase to 80%.  The Hungarian state took three or four different options into account, including American companies like Westinghouse and French companies like Areva.  I think there was even a Finnish proposal.  Given that the existing and operating power plant is Russian-built and is operating relatively smoothly, the addition of another block is technically and technologically most feasible if it is done by the Russians and not by the Americans or anyone else.  The Russians offered quite a good financial package.  I should mention that this all happened well before the events in Ukraine and Crimea.  It would have taken a soothsayer to see what was going to happen in the future.<\/p><p>  With regard to gas, the reverse flow meant that Hungary was exporting the largest amount of gas to Ukraine.  Hungary stopped the reverse flow of gas to Ukraine because winter was coming and a Hungarian reserve needed to be provided for.  We stopped it because we wanted to be able to provide the necessary amount of gas for Hungary in the first place.  As I have said, Hungary was the country that had been exporting or re-exporting the largest amount of gas to Ukraine.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan asked how many homeless people there are in Hungary.

Most of the so-called \"surplus taxes\" that were mentioned have been imposed on banks and telecommunications companies, etc., that were paying relatively low taxes.  The Government believes the utilities that were sold into private ownership with guaranteed profits, etc., are strategic sectors.  By the way, they are being bought back at their market price.  The different taxes on the banks and the other organisations are not extraconstitutional.  The case can be made for and against whether these taxes make sense.  I would like to add that approximately 80% of the banks in Hungary are owned by foreign \"mother banks\", especially German, Italian and Austrian banks.  They were making their highest profits in Hungary and neighbouring countries.  For that reason, it does not seem excessive to tax them to make them share some of the economic burden.  By the way, this whole process has been co-ordinated with the banking union and others who have sometimes - not quite happily - seen the point and accepted the justification for extra taxes.<\/p><p>  I was asked about the blacklisting of NGOs, which is a very controversial issue.  Approximately 80,000 NGOs are operating in Hungary.  There is currently a dispute with one of them.  The NGO that has a dispute with Hungary is running three of the 12 programmes under the so-called Norwegian fund.  The other nine programmes are handled by the state.  As the members of the committee might be aware, the Norwegian fund is given to each of the new member states.  In some countries, like the Czech Republic, the whole programme is run by the state.  In Hungary, nine programmes are run by the state and three programmes are run by NGOs picked by the Norwegian fund.  One of them is under discussion at the moment for suspected economic irregularities and possible non-transparent operations.  With regard to the economic or financial irregularities, the chief executive of this NGO, Veronika Mora, admitted in an interview that it had been having some irregular financial activities, such as pre-financing programmes which they should not have done.<\/p> <p>Strictly speaking, there might have been some financial problems with the handling of the programmes.  Second, it was not quite transparent because the applications were given to two independent reviewers but ultimately in a lot of different cases, the independent reviewers' written assessments and points were thrown out the window and organisations which previously had not been given very favourable reviews by independent reviewers were provided with the funds.  <\/p><p> This is a very unfortunate dispute, which has been blown out of proportion.  I think that sooner or later the problem will be solved in co-operation with the Norwegian partner.  There is an ongoing investigation and debate between the Norwegian and Hungarian sides, so I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014100900007#F00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We are in compliance with the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>.  The fundamental law in Hungary is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  In the past hour or so, I repeatedly wanted to convey this message, that there might have been disputes over certain sections, not the whole, but the government went out of its way to meet half way with the requirements and requests of the European Union.  Let me give one example, which is the case of transferring a case from one court to another.  There are countries in the European Union in which the Judiciary can transfer one case from one court to another.  The Hungarian Government took this provision out of the fundamental law at the request of the European Commission despite the fact that we maintain the view that it is not anything new and is an existing practice in the European Union.  On Tuesday, it was mentioned that the Hungarian Government was constitutionalising certain regulations, that is, taking them from the area of common law and putting them in the constitution and, therefore, they cannot be challenged by the courts.  This is what the French were doing in several different cases.  Regulations that were widely disputed were simply put into the constitution, putting it beyond the reach of the courts in France.  In general, every single provision that one can find in the fundamental law or the different amendments to the Hungarian fundamental law can be found in one, two or three or more members of the European Union, possibly not everything in one constitution but the point is that not one single provision has been put into the constitution that has not been present in one, two or three other constitutions or fundamental laws in European Union countries.<br\/>As I said in my opening statement, the Hungarian fundamental law and its amendments have been thoroughly investigated, debated and scrutinised as no such legislation has been in the European Union.  Frankly speaking, I think we possibly contributed to a stronger European Union because certain precedents have been created with this process.  Therefore, the European Union has been made stronger simply by showing that any debate within the family can be settled peacefully, democratically and in a way that is in the spirit and tradition of European values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014100900008#G00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

As well as being obliged to attend other meetings, a number of them are due to be present in the Chamber.  We are meeting earlier than is normally the case.  The only item on the agenda is our engagement with His Excellency, Mr. N&eacute;stor Osorio, Ambassador of Colombia to Ireland, who is accompanied by the deputy head of mission, Mr. Juan Manuel Uribe.  The format of the meeting will be that we will hear a brief presentation from the ambassador which will be followed by a question and answer session.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to welcome the ambassador and the deputy head of mission.  The ambassador has had a distinguished career.  When I met him last night, he told me that he had been Colombia's permanent representative to the World Trade Organization and the United Nations in New York, where he was president of the Security Council during Colombia's membership of it in 2011 and 2012.  He is resident in London.  One day his country and ours will have resident ambassadors in Dublin and Bogot&aacute;, respectively, which would make a great difference.<br\/>Mr. Osorio has started his first visit to Ireland well, having presented his credentials to President Higgins yesterday.  I congratulate him on his appointment as ambassador to the United Kngdom and Ireland.  This visit has been engaging and he has covered a wide range of activities, reflecting the engagement with Latin America.  This is important for us, as the region has significant potential.  Ireland has many historical links with it and we recently opened a new consulate general office in South America, on which I am sure the committee will focus further.<br\/>The ambassador has had a busy week.  Last Tuesday he launched a specially produced book written in Spanish and English at the Irish Writers Centre in Parnell Square entitled, <i>Ireland\/Colombia: 20 Poems<\/i>, which was written by Irish and Colombian writers.  His presentation yesterday in the library of Trinity College Dublin on Gabriel Garcia Marquez and world literature was appreciated.  He has also met many companies and focused on trade.  This morning he met the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It has been a great start to his first official visit to Ireland.  There is a growing market, with major prospects for trade between our two countries and Mr. Osorio's visit recognises the potential of our relationship with Colombia.<br\/>The ambassador will brief the committee on the issues obtaining in Colombia following the presidential elections.  The committee has focused on Colombia in recent years.  Deputy Eric Byrne visited the country earlier this year and I visited it with the then Deputy Michael D. Higgins three or four years ago.  Colombia has had a terrible century and at times was on the brink of falling.  Long-standing social injustices, underdevelopment and poverty generated by terrorism have been impacted on by a drug-fuelled business.  However, Colombia has come a long way.  Mr. Osorio will update us on the issue of human rights, as well as the victims' law and land restoration law, just two steps the Colombian Government has taken in its progress.  He may also update us on FARC and the meetings in Havana.  The European Union has responded to this development by negotiating a free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru that is provisionally in effect.  Such agreements are the European Union's strongest instrument in encouraging social and economic progress among partner countries.  We know that the situation is not perfect, but Colombia has come a long way, particularly in terms of human rights, as acknowledged by the UN human rights commissioner.  We look forward to hearing the ambassador's comments.<br\/>Before we start, I remind members and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as even when left in silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br\/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br\/>I invite the ambassador to begin.  I am sure he has much to tell the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100900002#A00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412845200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for receiving me and my deputy.  As the Colombian ambassador to Ireland, it is a great honour to attend the meeting and have the opportunity to exchange views on the current situation in Colombia, the way we are shaping our future and the important responsibilities and commitments the government of President Juan Manuel Santos has been undertaking.  After four years of government, he was re-elected last June for another term of four years, starting in August.<\/p><p>  The Colombian Government's main programme has been marked by the clear inclination to put together the best economic and social conditions, while building on the work done in the previous eight years to create conditions of security, thereby creating an atmosphere of trust and confidence for investors and an environment that is friendly to foreigners interested in developing businesses in Colombia.  As the Chairman mentioned, we have been trying to move past the difficult years we endured in the 1980s and early 1990s, while projecting a mood of reconciliation and seeking a solution to a conflict that has affected Colombia for more than 50 years.  Ours is a well known case and the only remaining internal conflict of this nature.  As the committee is aware, a clear resolution of a peace process that will finally give a solution and provide a substantial impulse for the country's economy will represent a major achievement.  For this reason, the Colombian Government's political approach, even during the presidential campaign, has had peace at its centre.<\/p><p>  Needless to say, in moving ahead with the process in a careful and well prepared way, we made important references to what had happened in this part of the world.  Ireland and Northern Ireland's contribution has helped and advised us in determining how to tackle the question of how to begin negotiations with groups that were reputed to be terrorists, drug traffickers and, of course, lawless and that were conspiring to revert the democratic system of Colombia, one of the oldest in the American hemisphere.  Our democracy has been very stable.<\/p> <p>During the well-known time of military rule in Latin America, Colombia had a minor dictator, compared with the others who were around at the time, for only three years, 1954 to 1957.  Today the Colombian people have tremendous hopes of concluding the peace process.  I will not go into much detail but simply remind the committee that we managed to agree an agenda of negotiations with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC.  The Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN, the other guerrilla group, is also entering negotiations, and there are secret talks to bring them to the table, if not to the same table in Havana, to another one.<\/p><p> Three important points on the agenda have already been agreed but have to be ratified once everything is negotiated: how to deal with the rural problem and reform, how to establish the future of political participation of these groups in Colombian life, and how to deal with dismantling of the coca fields and the drug trafficking in which FARC has been involved.  The two last hurdles, which are decisive for the process, are how to establish the ceasefire, organise the rendering of arms and verify the identification and dismantling of mines planted by the guerrillas.  The second is how to enter into a process of transitional justice where we can find a common point to cope with accountability and make clear there is no impunity but at the same time work on a reconciliation process that will help unify society again.  This is a big challenge for the process because it is well known that the guerrillas have committed, and some of their commanders have been condemned for, crimes against humanity.  This is a very serious matter that needs to be recognised.  We know the international community is following this process very closely.  We will need international co-operation and understanding when we reach an agreement.<\/p><p> When that has been reached, international co-operation will be important for the post-conflict era.  President Santos is coming to Europe at the beginning of November where he will visit five capitals in one week to talk to the Heads of State to try to organise and pledge an approach.  We need a specific long-term plan to finance, assist, follow and accompany the post-conflict process in Colombia.  It is a major task.<\/p><p> As a member of the United Nations Security Council I was involved in part of the process in African countries and other places, for example, in Timor Leste, to make the transition from conflict to post-conflict.  We have the advantage, as distinct from some of those countries, that our institutions are very serious, we have a working democracy and an economy that is internationally regarded as orthodox and well-managed.  Our rate of inflation is lower than 3%.  We have increased the labour force, creating 2.5 million jobs, as formally verified, in the past four years.  We are one of the developing countries that can qualify globally as an emerging market, having accomplished all the millennium development goals, established in 2000.  We have been at the forefront in promoting the sustainable development goals that will be an essential part of the new world economy model post-2015.  This is one of the most important projects in the United Nations.  Next year the UN will adopt the sustainable development goals approach for the next generation.  Foreign investors are sympathetic to our economy because of how it is organised.  Last year we broke the record with $16 billion of foreign investment in Colombia.  In the first semester of this year we achieved 5.4% growth and project a sustained 5% growth which, compared with the Latin American average of 2%, is a success story.<\/p><p> Colombia, and the government of President Santos, have placed special emphasis on education and improving the lives of people in poverty.  President Santos got more votes in poor places where social work was developed.  That is rewarding for a politician because it shows that the government has addressed important issues.<\/p><p> The international community wants to analyse how human rights issues are developing.  In a conflict such as the one we have had there have been excesses and violations.  That is why President Santos put a clear approach and policy to improve and get this right at the top of the agenda.  International agencies, including the UN and an American organisation for the states in the area, have recognised an improvement in the way the unions and human rights issues are addressed.  Part of this is included in the framework for the peace process, identification and recognition of the victims, and concrete steps towards recognising their human rights.  Three years ago Colombia passed an important law of victim reparation and land restitution.  I invited the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to visit when the law was being enacted.  He has used this law as a reference point for other parts of the world.  I have distributed a document showing how the agencies organising the government work very positively.  There is still work to do.  We are addressing that responsibly and are moving ahead in order to create the necessary economic, social and human rights environment that meets the highest standards.<\/p><p> We are formal candidates for membership of the OECD.  That implies having minimum basic indicators to show that the economy is well managed, social issues are well addressed and people&rsquo;s rights are fully recognised.  I am confident we are moving ahead and that Ireland will co-operate with us in this.<\/p><p> The free trade agreement makes a clear case for us in terms of the internationalisation of the country.  President Santos has made clear from the outset the need to have a base for Colombia to act on the international stage.<\/p> <p>With the size and capacity of the country we were very privileged when the Government of Colombia was elected to the UN Security Council.  I have had the honour of being the permanent representative to the UN and this allowed me to contribute to addressing the substantial problems of the world and be part of many fora.  I was elected president of the economic and social council of the UN, another opportunity to put forward the goodwill of Colombia to be a valued actor and participant in the international scene.<\/p><p> When we move ahead with a clear policy of opening up markets, creating free trade agreements and having free trade conditions, we are inviting our partners, such as Ireland, to be part of our development and to contribute to that development.  We are inviting investors to do business in our country.  We are creating an environment by taking a new approach, and the famous Pacific Alliance - Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, the four like minded countries are in tune on free trade agreements, protection of foreign investment and double taxation.  Foreign investors and those who participate in our economic life have the opportunity to access our market individually or the four markets in the group, which together are bigger than Brazilian market, the colossus of Latin America.  We have free trade agreements with the United States, Korea and Japan.  The expansion of the possibilities of business is substantial.  I invite Ireland to give favourable consideration to the accession and the approval of the free trade agreement.  At present 17 countries of the European Union have approved this agreement and I hope that Ireland will join these ranks very soon.<\/p><p> I am delighted to be here, and am ready and available to talk to members as many times as they deem necessary.  Even if it is not necessary, it will be a pleasure for me to come and have the opportunity to develop this friendship and to continue to work in the cultural, social, educational and economic fields.  We know we have friends here and Ireland should know it has friends in Colombia<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We in Ireland have very little trade with South America and it is opportune that he is here because I am sure it is the Government's intention to try to develop our trade with the South American countries, of which Colombia is one.<\/p><p>  My interest is concentrated on the peace process in Colombia.  Last December I spoke at a conference in Bogot&aacute;, at which I was asked to do a paper on disarmament and the decommissioning which was a major part of the peace negotiations in Ireland and its relevance to Colombia.  While I was there I had the opportunity to see places, in particular the area around the Independence Memorial.  I also visited to Cartagena, which is a beautiful spot.  Colombia is a lovely country.<\/p><p>  There have been many decades of guerrilla activity.  As we found in Ireland, the root cause to some extent of what happened was inequality and ill treatment of a particular section of the community.  I think that has been a feature in Colombia.  I invite the ambassador to talk a little about that and in particular about the efforts that are being undertaken to ensure greater equality and treatment of people.  A colleague, who is not present, told me recently he visited some of the prisons in Colombia and was concerned with regard to the conditions in which these prisoners are being held.<\/p><p>  I know that aspects of the negotiations have been provisionally agreed but I think the policy, which is correct, is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  This is a sensible approach in these difficult situations.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Osorio give some outline indication as to the detail of the disposal of agricultural land in rural areas, a core part of the campaign of FARC?  I understand that the issue of illicit drugs, which I considered a particularly difficult matter, has been concluded.  When I studied Colombia, I thought that dealing with the issue of illicit drugs would be particularly difficult.  Much of the income of the small landholdings comes from growing the drugs.  Obviously we in the western world would like to see that crop outlawed, but how does one provide replacement activities for the people living in those rural areas?  When I was in Colombia I had the opportunity of meeting President Santos, who told me he had visited Northern Ireland.  He was very committed to bringing the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion.  We encourage him and the delegates present to continue to do that.  There will be setbacks along the way and one will face disappointments but above all one must have the perseverance to stay with the process and ultimately have a sustainable agreement that will serve the interests of the people of Colombia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100900005#D00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1412846400,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I propose to bring in every member offering because I am sure most of the questions will overlap as they will be on the same theme.

It is always good to start with the positive.  There are positive signs from what Mr. Osorio, has said about what is happening in Colombia, in particular to the peace process.  We should acknowledge the role of Cuba - I know the Cuban ambassador is present - in facilitating those talks in Havana.<\/p><p>  I would have been in touch with his predecessor over a number of human rights issues, one of which was the murder of C&eacute;sar Garc&iacute;a and the community in Pitalito who had been displaced, and returned only to be displaced again.  I know Colombia is a very dangerous place to be a trade unionist and there has been an alarming number of murders of trade unionists.  More recently it was the imprisonment of  Huber Ballesteros, the vice president of the Agricultural Workers Union.  Some of the trade unions in Ireland have brought campesinos or other Colombian workers, trade unionist or women farmers to Ireland.  I met them and know how difficult life is for them.  I believe we have a right to peaceful protest but the peaceful protest of the women and the campesinos has been met with violence.  I wonder about Mr. Osorio's comment about the role of the army and the police when people try to protest peacefully.<\/p><p>  In regard to the trade agreements, is Mr. Osorio satisfied that the human rights clauses in the trade agreements are strong enough for the people of Colombia?  I wish to raise questions on the role of multinational companies that are locating in Colombia, as well as on the issue of biofuels, which means that Colombian peasant farmers are losing their land which has fed their families for generations.  Between the gold mining and the biofuels, the people are losing their land and moving into towns and cities, which is putting more pressure on services to feed people.<\/p> <p>I am interested to hear what the ambassador thinks about the human rights clauses in those trade agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100900005#D00500","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412847000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That committee has discussed Colombia and the free trade agreement.  I am a member of Sinn F&eacute;in and we wholeheartedly welcome the progress in the peace process.  The North's Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, who is a senior member of my party, and the Minister, Mr. Conor Murphy, MLA, have gone to Colombia at the invitation of President Santos.  We have also met FARC representatives.  We would have policy differences with President Santos, but we welcome that his re-election was an affirmation of the general will within Colombia to achieve peace.<\/p><p>  We are being asked to ratify the free trade agreement.  Even if we look at the news from Colombia this month, we see that human rights defenders have received death threats.  The UN has asked the Colombian Government to dissociate itself from those death threats.  We have seen peasant farmers killed by riot police and prisoners beaten up by guards.  In recent years, trade unionists and human rights defenders in Colombia have been treated very badly with regard to their efforts to bring to light some of the major social inequalities that exist, and obviously some of the difficulties of indigenous peasants there.<\/p><p>  Trade can be a tool to bring about social justice and human rights, but it is not necessarily so.  Any free trade agreement needs to contain a mechanism to measure the changes happening in society to ensure trade has a correlation with improvements for citizens within a society.  I do not believe this free trade agreement does that in any way.  We met human rights lawyers who have been working in Colombia.  We also met representatives of Christian Aid, Tr&oacute;caire, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Justice for Colombia.  These highly respected social and citizen organisations in Ireland are calling for the free trade agreement not to be ratified, because they believe the ratification of the free trade agreement would not have the effect of relieving the oppression being experienced by people in Colombia.  As late as in 2012, even the European Parliament called for the necessary mechanisms to measure changes to be included in free trade agreements.  This agreement has no independent committee or body to measure those changes properly.<\/p><p>  I believe Ireland would like to work with Colombia to increase our trade relationship.  We would like this major humanitarian disaster not to be a stumbling block.  The way to resolve it, from a Colombian perspective and perhaps from a European perspective, would be to ensure the necessary tools and infrastructure are within the free trade agreement to ensure there is a beneficial trend within human rights in Colombia.

On the issue of equality, or rather inequality, one of the recognised big problems of Colombia is the tremendous gap that exists and the need to upgrade and create conditions for the poor people of no or very low earnings to go up the ladder and be active citizens.  That is why in developing the programme for government and in developing the approach to the big issues of Colombia, President Santos encapsulated his priorities for the next four years by talking about prosperity, education and equality.<\/p><p>  This is important in the sense that education is placed at the centre with a clear determination.  We have achieved already almost 100% coverage of boys and girls who complete primary school in Colombia.  If we pursue this quest of education, we will create the basis for the future for this social upgrading and for a more equal society.  As the Chairman has observed, even if our middle class has grown, the distribution of earnings today compared with 15 years ago is abysmal.  We still have people who live in extreme poverty.  When we evaluate this aspect of the millennium development goals, the eradication of poverty, it is clear that Colombia has managed to get out of this extreme poverty in real terms.  It is close to 2 million in these four years and this is with the following of the United Nations standards and analysis.  We keep on that and it is a very sensible matter.<\/p><p>  Connecting this with the different issues that have been mentioned here, as far as we managed to reduce these gaps, we create more educational opportunities and we open the possibility of new business.  At the same time that we are eradicating poverty, I want to mention the need to create wealth.  This is the real thing.  We need to create wealth and we create wealth with new business and new projects, with public works and with private investments, and that creates employment.  There are not separate compartments.  At the beginning of the first government we talked about the locomotives - different locomotives that work together and develop the society and the economy in a homogenous way.  One of the big responsibilities of the government is how we create educational opportunities and open the country for business with the conditions necessary to be attractive, thereby creating employment and promoting people on the social ladder.<\/p><p>  The issue of respect of human rights is very serious.  The Deputy said it is very dangerous to be a trade unionist in Colombia, and that has been the case.<\/p> <p>There are ways to demonstrate this.  The situation has improved, which is something which must be taken into consideration.  <\/p><p> One of the tragedies of Colombia during the conflict with the guerillas involved the formation of paramilitary groups which developed their activities during a time in which the capacity of the Colombian state to fight the guerillas was very poor.  The capacity of the army was much reduced.  In a way, there was a permissive attitude among civilians, especially in rural areas, in organising to protect themselves from guerilla attack, but something unexpected, or unimaginable, developed.  These groups of peasants in trying to protect their crops became contaminated by individuals who took advantage of these conditions to take properties illegally and displace people under the pretext that they were co-operating with the guerillas.  I invite members to analyse the role of the paramilitaries, acting illegally and at the margins of the law of Colombia.  The government has tried to dismantle some criminal bands which developed subsequently.  In many cases, it has been proved that it was these paramilitary groups which started to kill trade unionists and violate human rights.<\/p><p> The armed forces have committed excesses, but these excesses have been dealt with before the tribunals.  We are having a big discussion to identify the device by which the military forces will be judged by the civil courts and which crimes will be judged by the military.  This happens all around the world.  There are some areas which are reserved for the military to judge, while there are others which belong to the civil courts.  We intend to continue down that path.<\/p><p> I frequently hear about the case of Mr. Huber Ballesteros.  He is notorious because he was about to travel to London for a union meeting.  According to all of the information I have received and the judicial procedures, there are serious indications that he was suspected of having been involved in providing arms for the guerillas and having been in contact with them.  This is something on which I will not make a judgment.  I have written many letters to the authorities which have responded to me on the status of these procedures.  I have spoken to the NGOs and Members of Parliament in London about the matter which we continue to follow.<\/p><p> It is very important that the government is prepared to recognise wrongdoing.  Last December President Santos made a public and international apology and asked for a pardon for a massacre which had taken place in San Jos&eacute; de Apartad&oacute; in 2005.  We went to a committee of the House of Lords with representatives of this community and went through an exercise of reconciliation.  That was a very courageous approach to take.  There is no obstacle in the President's path and he is prepared to put at the disposal of the judiciary those who have committed excesses or crimes under our criminal code.<\/p><p> The issues of rural reform and drugs are very much inter-linked.  It is very clear that a substantial part of the finances of the guerillas came from drugs.  FARC has been trying to say it was not involved in the production of crops, that it was just taxing those who were moving the drugs around.  However, it is clear that it controlled the territory in which the cocoa fields were located.  This has emerged in the negotiations and it has recognised it.  The plan is for the total eradication of cocoa fields.  We have dismantled more than 30% of the areas cultivated with cocoa crops ten years ago.  In the 1980s no more than 5% to 7% of the cocoa fields were located in the country.  The cocoa crops were cultivated in Bolivia and Peru where it is an ancestral crop.  The drug traffickers and those who developed the cartels were clever and decided to cultivate the crops rather than depend on the Peruvians or Bolivians.  That is how 80% or 90% of the cocoa crop in the world was grown in Colombia.  There has been an eradication of 60% of it.  Therefore, good progress has been made.  We will talk about this issue with the international community.  However, the point is that if we manage to bring FARC on side to act as a promoter of rural reform, we will be able to develop according to the needs of the regions.  <\/p><p> Many members have been to Colombia and know that the topography of the country is better for the cultivation of some crops, including small crops, coffee being one example.  I have been involved in coffee production all my life.  As I was the executive director of an international coffee organisation and visited all of the coffee producers of the world, I know what I am talking about.  There are 2 million people involved in coffee crop cultivation and transportation. Some 500,000 families work together and the average size of a piece of land is 3 ha.  Very few have 50 ha.  The position is different in Brazil where it is an agri-industry.  In Colombia coffee production is a family business.  There are other areas such as the plains in the east of the country where, with the development of intensive agri-industries and big investment, it will be possible to develop what we need to develop.  Investors from Ireland could play a tremendous role, given the expertise available and developments here.  When I presided over the committee of agriculture of the WTO, I was involved in launching the negotiations on the famous subsidies, about which members know.  I came to Dublin to meet all of the agricultural producers and the companies which managed them.  I know about Ireland's expertise in the matter and to what degree it could help us.  This goes to the heart of what we are addressing.  We are asking the international community for a contribution and its co-operation.  After the resolution of the conflict, we are able to give ownership of the land to the people in question and it will not stop there.  The credits will then come - the technical assistance and agricultural practices.  It is like a Marshall plan to develop agriculture, with the participation of the people in question who will have the possibility to develop an activity.<\/p><p> One has to bear in mind that the members of FARC must spend their lives in the rural areas.  We are not planning to bring them to Bogot&aacute; or Medell&iacute;n, which I do not think would appeal to them.  Their reintegration into society will be in the areas with which they are familiar and in which they will feel comfortable in developing activities.<\/p> <p> I can offer the example of the coffee industry.  When we were negotiating the quota agreements in London in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the drug issue was at the centre of the negotiations.  What we put forward to the United States, the European Union and Japan in the negotiations, which were negotiations between producers and consumers, was that if we managed to get a remunerative price for the coffee growers and get them to guarantee production and supply of the product to the consuming countries, they would not be distracted into the drug trade, even if they were paid 50 or 100 times more for the crop of coca.  That was the case.  There is little drug production in the coffee areas.  Some of the drug barons wanted to buy coffee farms to have those farms, but drugs did not become part of them or it was a very small proportion.  It was also not land for the guerillas either.<\/p><p> We are convinced that if we manage to create a productive agricultural system in the rural extensions, that are small or big according to crops, we will be able to be part of the very important challenge that humanity faces for the future.  In 2040 to 2050 the world population will be 9 billion people and it will consume double the amount of food being consumed today.  Colombia is one of the countries that has the potential to be a provider of land and, with our biodiversity, it is also one of the countries that will continue to protect the planet.  There are clear indications that by solving the problem of land distribution and drug cultivation we will create job opportunities and social upgrading.<\/p><p> On the issue of illegal mining, this is one of the problems we face.  It is not very new but it is also not old.  Part of the reconversion of illegal activities by some of these illegal groups has been to move to illegal mining, with risks for the environment as well as the displacement of people and robbery of land.  One of the practices of the paramilitary people was to arrive at a place, force the owners to sign the papers and then force them to go to the notary to transfer the land to them.  We are making an inventory of this in the country.  The members of the committee will see some figures on that in the papers we will distribute.  We are making an inventory of who has been deprived of their land and we have already restituted many areas of land to the owners.  We will continue to do that in the future.<\/p><p> Another issue on which Colombia has been keen to make progress is gender equality.  Special laws have been passed in Colombia to promote women and young girls and to fight one of the most hideous activities in the world, sexual violence.  On the Security Council we were at the centre of making proposals for resolutions and initiatives.  I convene a women's forum in Europe in the ECOSOC, as the Colombian delegation, and with the co-operation of many other countries.  I pay tribute to Cuba, which is hosting our peace talks, and Norway, where the talks have started, as well as Venezuela and Chile, which are the witnesses in the process.  They are helping and facilitating us, but we have the ownership and the clarity of the process.  We know that the international community is ready to help us and the most appropriate moment for that contribution will be in the post-conflict era.<\/p><p> I refer to the committee's considerations about the free trade agreement.  As one helps to create job opportunities and to develop a business partnership, one is promoting social insertion, the creation of jobs and creating a sense of moral responsibility about respect for human rights.  Perhaps the human rights processes in the agreements are not ideal or perfect and could be more ambitious, but this is an area that, along with the free trade agreement, we will continue to work on in the framework of the relevant international organisations and the relevant international community fora.  It is something we are very clear that we have a responsibility to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014100900006#E00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

She is leading the CRC through a particularly challenging time, as well as an interesting and important time for Northern Ireland.  Ms Sylvia Gordon is also a director of Groundwork Northern Ireland, an organisation that practices conflict transformation and peacebuilding through regeneration.Members of the committee will have visited Belfast several years ago and seen some of the excellent work she has led in working at interfaces and removing one of the interface barriers at Alexandra Park.  It is incredibly challenging work.  Mr. Tony Kennedy is a former chief executive of Co-operation Ireland.  He has a lifetime of experience and, although he has retired from Co-operation Ireland, continues to work in a variety of initiatives promoting reconciliation in Northern Ireland and greater cross-Border co-operation.  This wealth of experience reflects the wealth of experience that the CRC has as a whole and has been delivering for the past 25 years.<br\/>Reconciliation is a key element of the Good Friday Agreement, mentioned in paragraphs Nos. 2 and 3, with all parties committed to reconciliation in Northern Ireland, between North and South and on these islands.  It is worth reading that agreement again sometimes as it is a visionary document that sets a high bar in challenging us all about future relationships on these islands.  This was reflected in subsequent agreements.  The St. Andrews Agreement, signed up to by all parties in the Northern Ireland Executive, referred to a society free from sectarianism and racism.  We believe these are important and critical commitments which need to be followed through in policy and practice on the ground.<br\/>The third peace monitoring report published earlier this year made several points.  It highlighted that the moral basis of the Good Friday Agreement may be evaporating; the absence of trust has resulted in an absence of progress; and the use of the police as human shock absorbers to deal with failure elsewhere.  The report essentially stated several issues must be addressed to make reconciliation real for the long term.  In this report, we wanted to highlight some of these issues, draw attention to them and challenge policymakers to ask what more can they do to make the reconciliation agenda on the ground.<br\/>The CRC welcomes the greater involvement of the two governments in recent weeks in pushing forward talks to address some of the critical political issues in Northern Ireland.  That does not reflect the failure of local political parties, however.  For many years, they have demonstrated significant and positive leadership.  However, as guarantors of the Agreement, the two governments have an important role in Northern Ireland.  The involvement they have now has been overdue for the past three years.<br\/>While that strategy and policy leadership at a political level is important, it is also important reconciliation is delivered from the ground up.  Reconciliation in Northern Ireland, however, is entering a crisis point for several reasons.  Part of it is because of the issues around political leadership, strategy and long-term support for the vision outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  That then is reflected in the resourcing of organisations important in that sector which can make it happen on the ground.  There is a funding crisis with those groups that deliver this significant and important work.  It is piecemeal, <i>ad hoc<\/i>, short term and not hitting the streets anywhere near quickly enough.  It is also not enough.  Central funding for reconciliation work within the Northern Ireland OFMDFM, Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, amounts to &pound;13 million while the CRC distributes &pound;2 million.  Two years ago, &pound;60 million of public investment was provided to a <i>Titanic<\/i>visitor centre in Belfast.  While it is a positive building which attracts many visitors, it would take the CRC 30 years to put that sort of investment into reconciliation and peacebuilding work.  If we do not address reconciliation and peacebuilding, the children of the visitors we get to the <i>Titanic<\/i>building now may not come back to visit in 30 years because we have not built the peace.<\/p> <p>Building peace is a critical priority.  When one looks at things like interface barriers, and others can talk much more cogently about this, there is a target to remove interface barriers by 2023 in the current programme for Government.  There is some very good investment through the International Fund for Ireland and also perhaps from the peace programme next year.  There will be a few million pounds going into the removal of interface barriers.  It will focus on the hardware, replacing one fence with another fence.  It looks better.  That is very positive incremental work.  To remove them, however, it is necessary to have investment in building relationships either side of those barriers.  It is key for communities in those areas on either side to start to trust each other well enough to remove those barriers ultimately.  I do not think any of us has any real knowledge of where the funding for that relationship building work will come from in the critical period from 2015 to 2020.  If there is no investment in that work, the interface barriers will not be removed.<br\/>This relates to fulfilling the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements to take reconciliation seriously and to resource reconciliation work.  It needs to be resourced on a long-term basis and it needs to be outcome based.  Groups, organisations and individuals - who show such courage on the ground undertaking the sort of work Ms. Gordon and many others do - should know that they are supported by Government and should be able to plan long-term.  They cannot do that at the moment.  Given the issues with funding, its scale and piecemeal and <i>ad hoc <\/i>nature, some of those groups will go under in the next few months or years.  The infrastructure supporting reconciliation is in crisis.  It also needs to be co-ordinated at a regional level, with a body at arm's length from Government, which would have the effect of removing it from the immediacy of the politics and economics within Government, supporting that sort of reconciliation work in the long term.<br\/>I know the committee visits Belfast regularly.  I invite the committee on behalf of the Community Relations Council to come and meet those groups doing this reconciliation work on the ground, to hear them and take evidence from them directly, independently and impartially.  We certainly would be happy to organise those meetings.  As we want to embed peace and ensure we do not return to more violent times in years to come, it is critical we prioritise and properly resource the reconciliation work that is needed on the ground.  It is not being resourced properly at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412847000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Osborne for the powerful presentation.

Mr. Osborne gave a clear outline of the situation pertaining in Northern Ireland at the moment in relation to the need to build on the reconciliation work.  Unfortunately, he also paints a gloomy picture.  That gloom regarding certain parts of civil and political society in the North comes to us through other channels.  Mr. Osborne states quite rightly the important role of both Governments as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  Both Governments need to be involved practically on a daily basis.  I am not making a political point.  It is a point I made to the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and I also made it to the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan.<\/p><p>  On the Haass proposals, I have argued consistently that the two Governments should be part of those particular negotiations on the basis that when we had substantial progress  - the Downing Street declaration, the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 and the St. Andrews Agreement - the two sovereign Governments were the driving agents in making that progress.  I have argued constantly since the end of December last year when, unfortunately, the talks did not end on a successful note that both Governments would have to be more than bystanders or interested observers.  They would have to be in the room and part of the negotiations.<\/p><p>  I welcome the statements of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Right Honourable Theresa Villiers MP, at the end of September and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan that it appears the new round of talks will have the active involvement of both Governments.  I sincerely hope it will and I think it is absolutely necessary.  We cannot allow these issues to continue to be a sore point.  They have to be dealt with.  It is as simple as that.  We are 16 years on from 1998 and the theme, as Mr. Osborne has clearly outlined, running through the Good Friday Agreement was reconciliation.  We had, for the first time, an agreement that gave us an inclusive political architecture for all of Ireland.  This was overwhelmingly endorsed by all the people of this island at the end of May 1998.  What the people ratified and adopted has not been implemented.  We can point to the failures, the deficits and the work of both Governments.<\/p><p>  We can also point to the deficit and the work in the Northern Ireland Assembly and in the Executive.  Some of the outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement - Acht na Gaeilge, the establishment of a North-South consultative forum, the need for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland - are all devolved issues.  The Bill of Rights must be agreed between all parties in the Executive and in the Assembly.  The commitments in relation to Acht na Gaeilge were devolved, if I recall correctly, in the St. Andrews Agreement to the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, with the agreement of the Executive being required. On the establishment of the North-South consultative forum, I asked during Question Time in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday who is threatened by a civic forum.  It is a no-brainer that it should be established.  Both as a party spokesperson and as part of the work of this committee, I have spoken to many communities who feel they have no voice and that no one represents them.  Surely civic society could play an important role in that respect.  While it will not satisfy entirely the needs of every community, we need to get those structures in place.<\/p><p>  Mr. Osborne mentioned one other thing that I wish to address.  I would always be quite wary of establishing another body.  One of the things I have thought, as a representative of two southern Ulster counties, Cavan and Monaghan, is that we have had far too much duplication and in some instances not the optimum return on the investment in different projects over the years. This was because projects grew as the situation emerged and that was understandable.  There is a case for greater co-ordination and less duplication.  I am concerned when Mr. Osborne says there is a need for a body which would have an overarching architecture to pull together all the reconciliation work and ensure adequate funding is provided.  I understand what he has in mind and I can see the value of it but I hope it would not be just another body to add to the numerous existing bodies.  The do exceptionally good work in very straitened circumstances, as outlined by Mr. Osborne.  Surely a Department should have in its remit the provision of funding for reconciliation work, which is very important, and the Department should be the agent to ensure the groups are adequately funded and there is a proper return to the taxpayer.  What has been outlined to the committee, and it is an issue that should be of concern to it, is that the work and the lack of funding is in crisis.  That is an issue we need to take up and raise in representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with whomever we can.<\/p><p>  The violence in Belfast on Monday night or Tuesday morning, when there was an attack on the police patrol and there was also a bomb alert, is of concern.  These are criminals who are commonly referred to as dissidents.  I do not use that word.  The term \"dissident\" had a certain meaning but, unfortunately, these are criminals masquerading as dissidents.<\/p> <p> Another concern I had was the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, MP, over recent days that she would establish a panel on contentious parades.  I fear this will undermine the work of the Parades Commission.  The Parades Commission, particularly the previous one - I am not sure the present commission is as strong - did good work in very difficult circumstances.  To have another review or panel examining the Parades Commission's decisions, which did not suit some communities, could be dangerous.  I hope my view is wrong, but I suspect it is not.  My sincere thanks for the presentations and for the work of the different groups over the years.  We are all aware of the work of Mr. Kennedy, who met us many times here in the Oireachtas in different guises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900004#E00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412847600,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Osborne for his presentation and welcome him.  The key to the success of reconciliation is leadership from a political and electoral side, from local government, business leaders, churches &ndash; given that the North is a very sectarian society &ndash; and sporting bodies, which can be sectarian and can be manipulated to be sectarian.  Leadership must come from the ground up in communities.  Mr. Osborne mentioned the absence of trust.  The question is how to structure leadership to build trust across communities.  Much of the progress that was made happened early in the process, because it was driven politically by both Governments and, significantly, by the US Government, the EU and the Nationalist and Unionist leadership.  Both Governments took it for granted early on that this was irreversible and, therefore, it went off their radar.  This has delayed the building of the trust and reconciliation and the achievement of a more secular, pluralist society.<\/p><p>  Mr. Osborne&rsquo;s presentation is an indictment of everybody.  Over 90% of children are educated in separate schools.  Reconciliation will not happen overnight but must be long term.  It has been a hobby horse of mine that a major part of reconciliation is to break down the sectarian divisions, and when sectarian divisions begin at kindergarten, we have a problem.  Mr. Osborne mentioned the City of Culture year and it is an example of how leadership can bring communities together.  The PSNI band played at the Derry Fleadh Cheoil.  It is very significant that it happened in a city with a huge Nationalist majority, whereas in places where there are significant Unionist or loyalist majorities there does not appear to be the same good will towards building reconciliation.  I say this with disappointment and a sense of a challenge.  What must we do to promote reconciliation?  Dissident republicans are probably more active in Derry than in other parts of the Six Counties, yet there is a progression towards reconciliation in the wider community.  I put this down to community leadership.<\/p><p>  Mr. Osborne mentioned a cultural war being talked into existence and referred to unemployment, lack of education, particularly among young Protestant boys compared with Roman Catholics, a lack of jobs and a sense of latching onto any issue that will give an identity in opposition to another identity.  It is all part of the equation and while I hope it changes, I am disappointed it has never been dealt with.  A significant positive statement - I do not want to use the word &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; - towards the other community came from Martin McGuinness when he met the English Queen, shook her hand and went to Buckingham Palace.  He was reaching out to Unionism, and it was very courageous, knowing where Republicans are coming from.  It was right to send the statement out.  The Nationalist leaders condemned the attacks on the PSNI.  It is in contrast with what happened around the flags issue and the riots, when similar political leadership did not come from the other side.  I am very strongly of the opinion that the only way we will get a more progressive approach from Unionist leaders is for the British Government to drive it, just as it drove the Good Friday Agreement by persuading Unionists it was the way to go.  The Unionist leaders went to a place they did not want to go but were compelled to because the British Government persuaded them it was the proper way to go, in the interests of peace and reconciliation.<\/p><p>  When one examines it, one sees the challenges ahead and the disappointment that we are not where we should be.  However, we are also in a far better place than we were 20 years ago.  We have come a long way.  We have come out of a mist of political violence, struggle and war - whatever people want to call it - to a situation in which we can talk about it and try to address it.  Part of reconciliation and addressing the reasons for conflict in the past comes from communities reaching out to each other, accepting each other's existence on an equal footing.  Deputy Smith mentioned a bill of rights.  A bill of rights is for everybody, not just one community.  It is about the obligation on powerful governments and structures such as the EU to ensure it happens.  It will not happen in five, ten, 15 or 20 years, but will be generational because we must move from a situation where many of us were part of conflict in the past, were born into it and lived through it.  We must wait until the next generation comes through.  We must put the foundation stones there for the next generation to be able to move into a normal environment.  This is a major challenge to us all.<\/p><p>  Much depends on funding for community groups and activists on the ground.  We sat here with people such as Jackie McDonald who are doing very good work in their constituencies to build peace and reconciliation with other communities, but they are strapped for funding.  It is very small money for big structures to contribute towards building reconciliation.  There is a moral obligation on them to do it, as there is on us as political leaders or representatives of our section of the community to help build the reconciliation by addressing the problems of the past and building a foundation for the future.<\/p> <p>Central to all of that is to break down the barriers of sectarianism, which comes about at kindergarten height.  There is an obligation politically, religiously through the religious institutions and through businesses about employment.  A person from one area of a particular religious persuasion will have a better opportunity of employment than someone coming from a minority area and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  That needs to be dealt with.<br\/>I mentioned sporting bodies.  Every aspect of society that is part of the wider community has a role to play.  If there such a thing as a structure, it means bringing all of that together.  It comes back to both Governments.  Both Governments have a moral obligation to deliver what they said they would deliver in the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and all the talks that took place prior to that and subsequent to that to bring that about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900005#F00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412848200,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I thank Mr. Osborne for his presentation.  Two issues are predominant in the presentation and are obviously critical to getting a post-conflict society, to use the terminology.  First is the question of integrated schools.  The Northern Ireland Community Relations Council document states:<blockquote><br \/>The Good Friday Agreement had provided the integrated-schools movement with what seemed like rock-solid endorsement, but subsequent expressions of policy emanating from the Assembly, such as the Programme for Government (2011-15), the Education Bill (2012) and TBUC (2013), all failed to mention integrated education.<\/blockquote>There is obviously a problem in that area.  There is a problem even with the attitude to integrated education within the power-sharing structure.  Following the theme Senator White mentioned earlier, is there anything our committee could do that would give an impetus to action on integrated education?  I accept there are all sorts of interest groups involved in the North and there are religious interest groups involved in maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Having said that, there is an onus to try to move it.  Educating people together is the big key.<br\/>The document states that because of economic necessity shared campuses are being developed.  They are sharing facilities between the two religions for financial reasons.  I suppose that is a step in the right direction.  How widespread is that?  What could be done to give this impetus?  I agree with Deputy Smith that the two Governments need to be involved.  When there is no movement they need to urge movement and create impetus.  This may be an area where the two Governments should do more.<br\/>The other critical issue is youth unemployment; it is obviously critical as a potential feeding ground for dissidents.  I note the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council's comment that young Protestants are now finding it harder than Catholics to break into the jobs market.  It stated that in the 16 to 24 age bracket 24% of Protestants were unemployed and 17% of Catholics were unemployed.  Apart from the fact that there are encouraging economic signs, are there specific actions under the EU Youth Guarantee scheme?  What specific actions could be done to get at this?<br\/>Deputy Ferris mentioned the culture war.  Does the Protestant community feel their culture is under threat?  Is one of the bigger problems now the insecurity of the Protestant community and how can that be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900006#G00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I invite our guests to answer the questions posed as best they can and to comment on some of the observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900006#G00300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412848200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a few of the points and then pass over to colleagues.  I apologise if I miss anything and the members should feel welcome to come back on it.<\/p><p>  On the Agreement, we have all underestimated the extent to which it is as difficult to stay within the terms of an agreement once it is signed, as it sometimes can be to reach the agreement in the first place.  I believe we have underestimated the extent to which we need to very systematically watch progress post a political settlement.  That is the big learning over the past couple of decades.  In that sense today is no different from any other day.  The challenge is to keep going, recognise where the dips are, identify them and deal with them, and keep going.<\/p><p>  So what is unique about the circumstances we find ourselves in at the moment?  It is a bit of a perfect storm as Mr. Osborne has said.  We have well-rehearsed political difficulties at the regional level.  In some ways there is nothing new about that, but they are fairly difficult and well-reported matters.  At the same time we have a falling away of the resources to support keeping the work going.  There are two dimensions to that.  One is the international component, the very welcome support we have had from Europe and America over many years - as well as from the Irish Government, if I may say it.  Some significant amounts of that funding are falling away just at the same moment as we are having some local domestic difficulties within our own budget.  So that notion of just keeping going is under some degree of practical threat.<\/p><p>  Another issue is structural change.  We are almost a couple of decades into the Agreement at this stage and there is a shift coming.  We have considerable change ahead of us regarding local government reform.  That will change some of the structures.  It represents a great opportunity to do more collaborative working to think about these issues in the round.  I completely agree with all members who made reference to that.  So there is an opportunity.  There is also a degree of threat because for the new councils there will be a bedding-in period.  They have been many practical issues to resolve.  There will be a falling-way of some of the staff who would have been familiar with these matters in the natural wastage that occurs during these changes.  So we have a structural component to this at the same time.<\/p><p>  Within that structural dynamic and taking time into account, we also have a generational shift.  I completely agree with the member; it probably will be the next generation who can really move things on.  However, we also have some evidence to suggest that the next generation might be just as thirsty to go back again if we were not very careful - they will have forgotten.  That is unbelievable in some ways, but it is also a very worrying feature.  We have to be really careful that the learning that our generation has and the dreadful experiences that our generation has, that the best of what to do about dealing with conflict and deal with social cohesion is passed on to those who come after us so that they know how to take care of these matters as we move forward.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some of the specific issues raised.  On integrated education, members will know there is a model that is favoured at the moment in the region, which is referred to as shared education.  This is built on the notion that we need to start where people are and get them used to the idea of being engaged with each other, which may include shared campuses, shared facilities and working together on some specific projects.  We believe there is a great deal of truth.  It is not possible to start from somewhere other than where people find themselves.  There are many people who are not yet ready for integrated education.  However, if the proposal is to start with shared education, then on this question of keeping an eye on whether we are implementing the spirit of the agreement, we should ask whether shared education will get us to where we need to be quickly enough.  So the question then is whether we have the luxury of time here or whether we need to take time much more seriously.<\/p> <p>Every child who goes through a separated education system is one child who has lost the opportunity of working and living together.  That is a price to be paid and we should measure it every time we make the choice to leave the issue for another while to be addressed until we all feel better about it.  I would frame the question in those terms.<\/p><p> A member mentioned the great effort being made at local level, as has been the case for many years, and the way in which that links to political and other change.  I completely agree with that view.  If we are to challenge ourselves about that, what has been missing over the last period of time has been a degree of connecting all that up, whereby we would have a sense that all of those individual worthwhile efforts are greater than the sum of their parts.  We have failed to get to the point at which that feels like a connected-up, resilient movement for change that can weather the storms of political challenge.  We have not quite got there yet, and this next phase of peace-building needs to take that opportunity into account so that we can see where we can get with that matter.<\/p><p> I wish to make one a final comment, before handing over to my colleagues, about the committee's participation, which I welcome.  Whenever the sovereign Governments get involved in the issues of the region, it is described sometimes, even by the Governments, in terms of something having failed, that politics at the local level has not managed to do whatever it needs to do and therefore the guarantors need to step in.  There is of course an element of truth to that.  If we go back to the Agreement - not only the spirit of it but what is written down - we can see it is unique.  It is not only a question of regional involvement, which would be a smaller measure in many ways; it leaves room for North-South, east-west access.  It is that aspect that triple-locked the safety of the peace process.  It would be helpful if we were to remember that and to think again about the way in which we could do it.  We are still learning and we are in the next phase of the post-political settlement.  Rather than viewing it in some sense or other as our not having managed to get to where we need to be - we are very sober-eyed about how far we have got and what more needs to be done - we should revisit some of the early difficult agreements that were reached and really honour them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline Irwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412848800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Irwin.

I am very fortunate that I have worked in north Belfast in particular over a number of years.  All of the work to which Mr. Peter Osborne alluded in his opening comments was achieved not only by myself and my organisation but in collaboration and partnership with other people in the voluntary and community sector local to the Duncairn interface.  I adopt a glass-half-full approach to this.  In terms of lack of leadership in communities, I have been fortunate to observe and be part of very positive leadership across the community divide, particularly in the Duncairn Gardens area of North Belfast, which allowed for the transformation of Alexandra Park in particular and the symbolic opening of the peace gate there.  I am disappointed that we as a society have not built on that momentum and that example of what could be achieved in regard to reconciliation work.<\/p><p>  In terms of the investment that is required, it is an investment in people.  It is about people.  One does not build relationships with an organisation; one builds a relationship with one's neighbour or colleague.  The investment that Ms Irwin and I are talking about requires an immense amount of time.  We have underestimated the time required to build confidence and trust and to do proper, authentic reconciliation work.  People are really challenged whenever they see that type of work, because it is unusual and unique.  Some people perceive it to be a threat.  Also, some people are concerned about what this will do and its impact further down the line.  As we know, politics in Northern Ireland is played out at a local and community level and we need to bear those dynamics in mind also.<\/p><p>  In terms of what we do for young people, we need to give them opportunities.  We must understand and appreciate that not everybody is graced with a good start in life.  I have been involved in a number of youth programmes, some led by my own organisation and others led by other people in the voluntary and community sector, and I have not come across one young person who does not want to work.  I have come across young people who desperately want the opportunity to be involved, to be part of society and to do something positive.  From our point of view, we need to provide opportunities, and if we provide opportunities we can then start to address many of the issues that will allow us to deal with interface barriers at some time in the future.  We must remember that those are physical barriers.  They are a physical manifestation of the ills of society, and we must address the ills of society if we are to have any real vision or hope of removing these barriers.  Sometimes we need to change the focus of our aspirations and how we might set out to challenge, overcome and deliver on the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to thank the reconciliation fund, because it is one of the funders that has allowed us to work in creative ways.  As a result of all the bureaucracy, the PEACE III programme does not necessarily allow an organisation to work in the creative and imaginative ways needed to deal with issues that arise the night before the issues it must deal with the next day.<\/p><p>  Another concern for me - this is something we must consider - is the cuts we are facing in Northern Ireland regarding a number of issues that need to be sorted out at Stormont.  We have a police service that is now saying it is under pressure, that it will not be fit to deliver and that community policing is out the window, so to speak.  Where does that leave the people in all those local communities who aspired to work through the rule of law and engage in policing for the first time in a meaningful, productive and effective way?  If we see some of those relationships disappearing, that leaves us in a very worrying position.<\/p><p>  Another concern is a statement that was made the other day, which we have flagged as an issue - namely, the issue of dissidents and criminality, which was mentioned here this morning.  They know we are facing an issue and they will exploit that.  This brings me back to my reference about young people.  If we can work with young people in a meaningful and effective way, that reduces the opportunity for those young people to be manipulated in other ways.  It is something that must be considered very carefully.<\/p><p>  I support what both Mr. Osborne and Ms Irwin said.  The British and Irish Governments are the guarantors of this Agreement and we need to see that on almost a daily basis at this stage.  A colleague of mine coined a phrase, \"The British and Irish Governments both stepped off the stage too soon.\"  We need them back on the stage fairly quickly, and I know the members are working towards that.  That is a positive from our point of view.<\/p> <p>The resource issue is critical for those in the voluntary and community sector who are engaged in this type of work.  While we were travelling down on the train, we discussed the way in which people sometimes viewed us as a reconciliation industry.  I assure the committee that we are not in this for the good of our health.  We are involved because of our passion and love for the place from which we come and our commitment to the peace process.  I challenge anybody who says we are an industry.  It is difficult, challenging and risky work.  Only this year, there was a protest outside our building in Duncairn Gardens by people who were unhappy about the consultation process concerning the Alexandra Park gate opening.  That consultation was thorough and the protest was grandstanding on behalf of people who were threatened by progress.  A pipe bomb was also thrown at the building recently.  It was a viable device and we were evacuated for two hours while it was made safe.  I have a job in hand in reassuring staff and partners.  That is a drain on my time and everybody else's.  Colleagues in this field of work have been threatened, put out of their homes and subjected to verbal and physical attacks.  Even though we are 20 years into the process, we have a long way to go.  Our responsibility is to bring as many people as possible on that journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sylvia Gordon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412849400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>This committee has been existence for three or four years.  From my experience, this is the most serious meeting we have held; it is heartbreaking.  As a committee, we should avoid being political between ourselves.  I think of all the people who work morning, noon and night to consolidate the peace process.  We met Dr. Haass in the early days of his engagement and could feel his optimism, but there was heartbreak at the end.  I put it down to the British Government and its reluctance to put its shoulder to the wheel.  If the issue involved the mainland - I used that word before and got into trouble for it - the UK Prime Minister would not be so distant from it.  This committee is responsible for monitoring implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and we have to take these issues by the scruff of the neck.  I blame the two Governments.  I have to be political now by pointing out that the late Albert Reynolds put the screws on President Clinton who, in turn, gave John Major a good push to make progress in the North.  That has to happen again.  Dr. Haass was left helpless because the British Government did not support him.  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the lack of serious business at the Executive, which is caught up in petty squabbles, rather than taking the core issues by the scruff of the neck.<\/p><p>  We have met Jackie McDonald.  The loyalist people feel they are floundering and have no leadership.  The bottom line is that they feel ostracised by people in the North.  The leaders want to consolidate the peace process, but the people in their backyard are critical of them.<\/p><p>  I am glad that we heard from the delegates.  For my part and on behalf of my colleagues, I will do everything I can to help them.  All of a sudden, it will break out again and there will be more moaning and groaning.  We know that it is serious on the ground because some people are bursting to get involved in trouble.  I would love if the committee could make a statement today that we believe there should be integrated education.  Unless children go to school together, we cannot expect them to have open minds to the other side.  We need to go for broke in the media today.  The Chairman does not have to give out about his own party, but he could on this issue.  It is vital to the peace process that we act more speedily.  Instead of taking a medium-term view, we should be taking action now.  I am emotionally upset having heard what the delegates had to say.  On behalf of all the people, North and South, who invested their efforts in the peace process, I am disappointed that it is languishing because of the failure of governments, including the failure of the American Government to put the screws on Mr. David Cameron and support Dr. Haass whose heart was in the right place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900008#J00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1412849400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for a very helpful intervention.

Ms Gordon referred to accusations that the Governments were stepping off the stage too soon.  That is the beginning, middle and end of the problem.  We are all responsible in this regard.  I listened with interest to Deputy Martin Ferris's remarks.  I was in the Oireachtas at the time of the ceasefire in the early 1990s and during the exciting period between 1994 and 1998.  We have moved a long way from that era, but, sadly, we have also taken our eye of the ball.  There were feelings of optimism and hope during those years which have not been regenerated in the past decade.  People have bought into the concept of no going back.  We all know that there will be no going back to the awful violence of the late 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s and are very happy with this, but we could well go back to a phase which might see monthly bombings and occasional murders, rather than daily bombings or weekly murders.  That would also be entirely unacceptable.<\/p><p>  We must address a myriad of difficulties.  I am concerned that a new marginalised community is evolving.  Until the mid-1990s in what I might call the old Northern Ireland, marginalised communities had a degree of interest in politics and engaging.  One side of the community supported Sinn F&eacute;in, while the other supported the DUP.  For a number of reasons, these parties have become politically dominant.  The Sinn F&eacute;in-DUP axis was traditionally on the margins, but it is now a new establishment.<\/p> <p>Now there are people who are excluded from that establishment.  We are talking about people who, let us be honest, were previously almost comrades in arms.  A total of 90% of those people have moved on to a better place economically, socially and politically but 10% are now in the new margin.  This is something we really need to be concerned about.  These people are the new marginalised who see their former colleagues and allies in a much better place.  One sees resentment, jealousy and all those human attributes.  We must try to address the concerns of those people.  It goes back to investment and jobs.  I do not know whether it was Ms Irwin or Ms Gordon who said that she did not know any young people who do not want to work.  This is as applicable to the Republic of Ireland as it is to Northern Ireland and is the reason the question of investment must be looked at again.  It is not a problem of the past two, three or four years but of the past decade.  <\/p><p> There has been complacency and sometimes an unwillingness to recognise how far we have travelled.  On at least six or seven occasions over the past 12 months in the Seanad, I asked that we would observe the momentous events of 1994 and that we would have statements or a debate but it just did not happen.  I looked at the D&aacute;il debates in the summer and early autumn and wondered where the debates reflecting the 20th anniversary of the ceasefire were.  As far I know, they did not happen either.  We are getting very excited, perhaps rightly so, about commemorations from a different period and what sort of commemoration, debate and approach we should take but I would certainly like us to reflect much more deeply on why and how 1994 happened, why and now 1998 happened and how we can progress things.  I would be more concerned about recent history and the future than what happened tragically 100 hundreds years ago.  We need much stronger political engagement to deal with what I see as the new marginalised because while those new marginalised communities and people are there, we have significant difficulties.  <\/p><p> We could speak all day about integrated education.  Perhaps I will be politically correct in respect of this.  In a perfect world, we would be driving it forward and it would be happening.  In respect of the communities in Northern Ireland, we must respect that progress can sometimes drip very slowly.  If one pulls the entire rug from under the feet of people who are clinging on in some way to old traditions and an older view of the world, fear and doubt could set in to a dangerous degree.  I would love to see children being educated in a very integrated fashion but I do not believe there is an instant overnight forced solution.  If we cannot at least integrate in the classrooms, we should look very carefully at the school curriculum and the way teachers are being allocated and try to ensure that there is a balance coming from a teaching perspective and not just from the students in the classroom.  There is a candidate for election to the Seanad who could tell a story about difficulties in that regard.  We can sometimes look a bit too simplistically at the debate about integrated education in Northern Ireland.  We must respect tradition and traditions will change very slowly.  There are lots of ways to assist, support, encourage and bring about integration and it does not always require a big stick.  <\/p><p> I welcome the presentations.  It is a wake-up call and a strong call on our governments, Ministers and all of us politically to acknowledge where we have come from but to realise that we cannot stand still.  There must be significant re-engagement in the process to keep it moving forward because if it does not move forward, it will go back.  It is not going back to the bad old days but it can still go back to bad places and we must be very vigilant in that regard.  As a non-member, I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to make those comments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900008#J00400","speaker":"1189","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It has been a very interesting discussion.  The one thing that probably many people have not realised is that making peace is a generational issue.  Many of us have not come to terms with the fact that it is probably going to take another 20, 30 or 40 years for it to work its way completely through all of society in Northern Ireland.  The one thing that would worry me slightly about getting the two governments involved in the process again is that at previous stages when the two governments and the US have been involved, it has always been to get concessions from republicans to move things forward.  I fear that during the current phase, it will be more a case of Unionists getting concessions that move things back.  There has always been a trade-off that Unionists have got something, be it decommissioning or the IRA saying it had gone off the field, to progress things.  When one looks at how the lines are drawn now in terms of flag protests and the fear of the undermining of the Unionist identity, the only thing they can do to get concessions is to move back in terms of political developments so I would be a bit worried about that.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that of the ten points of interest in the peace monitoring report, three or four of them apply to loyalist working-class communities and the difficulties they have.  That is where the real crux of the problem is.  There is no political leadership for working-class loyalists or Protestants.  The DUP and the UUP have traditionally viewed them as cannon fodder over the years and have given succour to the loyalist paramilitaries by attempting to distance themselves from them but at the same time, everything they are doing is inflaming and stirring up the situation.  I do not know if this is something for the witnesses and the Community Relations Council but work needs to be done in working-class loyalist communities in building political leadership that looks at the conditions they are in, the source of those conditions and how to grow out of them.  I do not know whether this is something that can be part of the witnesses' work, whether anybody is doing this work or whether it is down to trying to get fledgling political organisations up and running within those communities.  It does not necessarily always have to be around reconciliation.  When one sees the levels of educational attainment and everything else, one can see that there are serious problems.  Unless those problems are addressed, we will always been be on the brink of something going badly wrong.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900009#K00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone.  I apologise as I was delayed chairing a session in the D&aacute;il.  I was interested in what the witnesses said about unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, in Northern Ireland.  There is an issue there about qualifications and skills.  I think it was talked about in the presentation I read.  Obviously, much of that goes back to the education system we have discussed.  I am very much in favour of shared education or Educate Together as we call it in some schools down here.  As some colleagues have said, there is an issue with regard to what is called the ethos of a school.  Could the witnesses tell us how hard is it to break away from that?  There have been situations in the Republic of Ireland where people have a preference for an all-Irish school - the Gaelscoil movement - or the traditional diocesan school, be it a parish school or a diocesan college.  We have Educate Together in a small way.  Parents might vote with their feet when they send their children to the local school.  It is a difficult one.  I recall how 40 years ago, I was very lucky to get a job as a primary school teacher in Galway city.  It was the first co-educational school in Galway city.  Some people thought it was revolutionary and more people thought that we were crazy and that we would shake the foundation of the State, to use the phrase.<\/p> <p>It was normal to me because, as a young child, I went to a small country co-education school.  There is that issue.  I do not know whether it is the same in other countries.  It provides an example of how difficult it is to get away from the different types of education available.  I suppose I could mention also the convent schools, in terms of various religious orders providing education.  How does that issue translate in trying to get employment, having the necessary qualifications and skills, and the gender gap?  That is the only question I have on education and tackling unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900009#K00300","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412850600,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kitt.

I will make up for it, the Chairman need not worry.<br\/>I am retired as chief executive of Co-operation Ireland almost six years and it is nice to be back meeting the committee.  Many of the arguments we are advancing I was probably advancing six or seven years ago when I was speaking to the committee's predecessors.  The peace monitory report quite rightly states there has been very substantial progress but if we were honest with ourselves, 20 years after the ceasefires and 16 years after the agreement, even those of us who knew it was a generational issue thought we would be further on than this.<br\/>I will pick up on a number of points.  The Haass talks have been mentioned quite a lot.  It is essential that there is resolution around the proposals.  They were not Haass's proposals.  They were proposals he distilled from the inter-party talks.  I always felt they should have been called the inter-party talks chaired by Haass rather than Haass getting the blame for them because it was the local people who were involved.  It is essential that those are sorted, but it is not sufficient.  The Haass proposals are essentially dealing with the political elements and a number of matters around that and, subsequently, there will still be the work that needs to be done on reconciliation.<br\/>The issue of leadership has come up a few times.  There should be leadership, but one of the problems has been that leadership has been sporadic.  A couple of years ago, the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson MLA, showed leadership by turning up at Casement Park to watch a GAA match with the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness MLA, but that was it.  It happened and then it disappeared afterwards.  The British Government has been criticised here - I agree with a lot of that - but it was not only the British Government that lost focus.  The Irish Government lost focus as well.  Understandably, given the economic circumstances that were being dealt with down here, it was certainly something that went off the radar.<br\/>What one needs is leadership, but one needs it within a clear policy context.  There are clear statements about what should be done, both in the Northern Ireland programme for Government and in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is about a full range of work, but what we have got, as mentioned in section 1 of the short leaflet on the peace monitoring report, is:<blockquote>the model on offer from the top is peace without reconciliation.  A culture of endless negotiation has become embedded and, without a vision of a shared society to sustain it, the peace process has lost the power to inspire.<\/blockquote>That is almost exactly it.<br\/>We need to look at what we do in Government Departments - this is North-South as well as inside Northern Ireland.  Programmes should not divide.  They should not encourage separation.  One should be looking positively at ways in which actions that are taken encourage peaceful cross-Border co-operation.  There has been a lot of progress made on that, although there is still some way to go.<br\/>Mr. Osborne spoke about a regional body that should oversee this.  There is a regional body that should oversee this and since I am no longer on it, I can say this and spare his blushes.  That regional body is the Community Relations Council, which should be empowered to take greater responsibility in overseeing this work.<br\/>We need to address the issues of security.  If members can get a copy of the <i>Irish News<\/i>from Tuesday of this week, it spoke about the divisions that exist in housing.  A housing executive spokesman stated that there are over 500 symbols of paramilitary murals, monuments, etc., in estates throughout Northern Ireland and it was difficult to stop this happening because the estates were single-identity estates.  A single-identity estate, in plain English, is an estate where persons cannot live because they are the wrong religion because it is either completely Catholic and a Protestant would be afraid to live there or completely Protestant and a Catholic would be afraid to live there.  A single-identity estate is a polite way of saying it is a estate where the minority, whichever it is, has been intimidated and has left.  What the police advises the housing executive is that although it is within its power to take these symbols down, the police felt it would cause too much community contention.  What that means is that illegal paramilitary organisations would attack those who took the symbols down.  Therefore, we are in an environment where these symbols exist in estates that have been made single-identity estates and the police is advising that nothing be done about it because there will be riots.  That is a collapse in law and order and it needs to be dealt with.<br\/>We know what needs to be done.  It has been working steadily for years - I did it in Co-operation Ireland.  One brings people together at the community level on what they have in common.  One gets them to trust each other and talk to each other.  Then one gets them to honestly explore their differences and start to understand where each other is coming from.<br\/>Although it is most acute in the Protestant working class at present, this is not exclusively a Protestant problem.  When one hears loyalist organisations talk about the lack of political leadership, what they mean, in fact, is that people do not vote for them.  On the Protestant side, people still vote and the Northern Ireland level of voting is still high.  There may be a lack of political leadership but the politicians still get votes.  I am not sure any of the members here would like to be accused of a lack of political leadership because constituents were not voting for somebody else rather than themselves, and the members need to look at that as a political point.<br\/>I will give a couple of specific examples of useful incidents that can happen but fall by the wayside.  Ten years ago Co-operation Ireland, together with the Centre for Cross-Border Studies and the then Institute of Public Administration, ran a training course over ten weeks with civil servants from North and South.  They got together, they carried out joint projects and they heard lectures about each other's political system.  We based this on what had been done in the precursor of the Europe Union after the Second World War when French civil servants went to work in Germany and German civil servants went to work in France to develop understanding.  We ran this on approximately &euro;20,000 a programme.  We got funding from the Special EU Programmes Body for a while.  It collapsed because we were unsuccessful in persuading both the Irish and British, and Northern Ireland, Governments that this was a programme worth sustaining.  It is a cheap and easy way of bringing people together and developing understanding, but it went to the wall.<br\/>The issue of culture has come up.  Culture is vitally important and Derry City of Culture was a tremendously strong example of what had been done.  Derry City of Culture is replicated in a range of other cultural events, such as F&eacute;ile and the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival.  There is a range of events across Northern Ireland, all of which have heard in the past week that their funding is being chopped by the Department of Trade and Industry because the Tourist Board will no longer fund cultural events.  To show that none of this is costless, the Twaddell Avenue protest costs &pound;40,000 a night to police.  The funding that is being cut from 61 cultural organisation is one month of policing of the Twaddell Avenue protest.  There are real costs in this regard.<br\/>Another place where there are real costs are schools, as members mentioned.  I suggest at some stage the committee ask for information on the unit costs of training teachers in Northern Ireland.  If the committee is told the truth, it will be told that the unit cost of teacher training in Northern Ireland is 40% higher than in other parts of the United Kingdom because there are separate education systems and separate colleges.  One of the odd aspects right the way through is that we have relied on schools and teachers to promote reconciliation.  One takes children who go to a single-religion school, one sends them to a single-religion teacher training college, and then one sends them back into a single-religion school and states it is their responsibility to promote cross-religious work.  Most of these teachers' lives have been outside this.  Co-operation Ireland ran a programme for years called Civic-Link, which brought schools together in a structured way looking at projects over a year but it has also gone because of the absence of funding.  These programmes fail to be funded right the way through.<br\/>We are facing a funding crisis because the rest of the world has got fed up funding the reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland.  More funding came from the European Union, through the PEACE programme, and from others, primarily the Americans, through the International Fund for Ireland, than both Governments put in for on-the-ground reconciliation throughout these years.  Although the Reconciliation Fund is a good one, and one of its nice aspects is it is much less bureaucratic than most others in that one expects returns but it is not dreadful, it is still at a comparatively low level.  It has always seemed odd that Northern Ireland is one of the most affluent places of conflict across the world but it expects all of its funding to come from the rest of the world.  The poor sods in South Africa had to fund theirs themselves.  Sierra Leone had to do so also.<\/p> <p>Everywhere else had to fund it themselves, but Northern Ireland expected the rest of the world to pay for it.  The Governments and the people should be paying for this sort of thing.<\/p><p> We are at an odd stage.  Substantial progress has been made, but there has been a belief that politics alone is enough to do it.  In reality, it requires long, slow, patient work of bringing people together.  It is not enough just to bring Catholics and Protestants together.  Every time Rangers play Celtic in Scotland, many Catholics and Protestants come together but it does not promote peace and reconciliation.  It must be done in a sustained, managed, co-ordinated way.  People must feel safe.  If people feel their culture is being threatened, that is not cured by saying \"that's tough\".  It is cured by working out the threats, getting people to talk it through, and building a long, sustained programme.  It needs proper investment, and we do not have any of that at the moment.  I ask this committee to go back and ask what the Irish State's sustained, co-ordinated programme for developing reconciliation within Northern Ireland and between North and South is.  What are different departments required to do?  What are the measures against which we assess their performance?  The chair mentioned at the beginning the need for an outcome-based approach.  What outcomes is the Irish State seeking from this and how is progress measured?  Likewise for the British State and the Executive.  If it is not measured, it is not done.  By doing that, one begins to clarify it.<\/p><p> It will not be me, because I will shortly be off community relations completely, but I suggest that this committee invites the Community Relations Council back annually to report on the state of play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412851200,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Would Ms Irwin like to contribute before Mr. Osborne sums up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900011#M00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412851200,"counter":791,"content":"<p>No, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900011#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline Irwin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412851200,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I thank the members of this committee for their contributions and the support they have shown.  I would not underestimate the importance of that, in their capacity as individuals and as representatives.  When people, like Ms Gordon and many others, within communities are taking on such a significant amount of work, sometimes at personal risk, and having to deal with the stress of that and the difficulties that come with it, we must not underestimate the importance of providing that verbal and moral support.  It is important that people feel that the work they are doing is valued, and that will help them to continue with that work, so I thank the members for that.<br\/>I will return to a couple of issues before summing up with two or three other points, as the Chair has suggested.  The City of Culture is an important event to look at.  People in that city will say there is no model, but that they have a number of underlying principles that have driven the success of what has happened up there.  It is very impressive when one sees what has happened.  For example, loyalist bands have taken part in various festivals in the South as well as in the North, and the police band received a standing ovation coming into Guildhall Square during the City of Culture year.  It was a transformative experience in that city.  The underlying principles are underlying principles for any area where there is dispute or where there is contention, whether over parades, flags, or anything else.  People were motivated in that city to do it.  They wanted to come to an agreement, they wanted to reach resolutions and the motivation existed.  In other areas, the motivation still does not exist.  The relationships were developed over many years.  It was not an overnight success.  Some of the groundwork was carried out in the 1980s and the 1990s and it led to something over recent years where the relationships and trust were built.  There was also leadership.  That leadership was very impressive across the community divide.  It is one of the reasons the Community Relations Council, for example, gave a civic leadership award to Willie Hay, a DUP MLA in that city, who is the current Speaker of the Assembly.  That award could also have been given to other elected representatives from other parties in that city, but it was business leadership as well as community leadership, law and order leadership and residents.  Combining those three elements led to success.  Those three elements are lacking in other areas, but when they are present, one tends to get results.  They have achieved a huge amount in that city, and it is important to reflect on it.<br\/>Someone raised the issue of the civic voice.  We have been considering this question for some time now, because the feedback we get on the ground is that people feel they are not being listened to and that their voice is not heard as strongly as it should be.  This is one of the reasons that for the recently drafted racial equality strategy, for example, the Community Relations Council brought together a range of black, minority and ethnic groups.  We agreed a common platform with them, which was the first time that has happened.  Sixty organisations have signed up to that so far, and it is hoped there will be more over the next few weeks as well.  That is civil society getting together, agreeing the critical issues that must go into a new strategy, which it is to be hoped will result in their voice being heard.  We need to reflect on how that sort of vehicle is used, because at the moment there is no vehicle for civil society to be heard as well as it could be.<br\/>It is important for the committee to continue to engage in this process.  It may be important for others to re-engage with it because the point was made, correctly, that this will take a generation.  Political agreement is one thing, and although it is very important, political agreement does not build the peace.  The peace is built on the ground by organisations doing that work.  This will take 20, 30, 40 or 50 years to do before we can say that Northern Ireland is at that reconciled stage we want it to reach.  This committee may well be meeting in 20, 30 or 40 years time to continue to consider these issues.  That is the reality and we must get our minds around that.  This is a long-term process.<br\/>It is useful to raise the issue of shared and integrated education.  It is a complex issue, as people have said.  Shared education is important, but shared education must mean that children are brought together, not just that buildings are used by two different schools.  People within the movement understand this, and integrated education is the maximum outworking of that, but there are huge complexities around it.  For me, the underlying issue is something that Mr. Kennedy mentioned, and that is mentioned in the peace monitoring report.  Shared and integrated education are components of reconciliation work and we want to see peace with reconciliation.  The peace monitoring report says quite clearly that at the minute we have peace without reconciliation.  We want to move to peace with reconciliation.  Reconciliation is a key component of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is right up there in paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 in no uncertain terms and in a very visionary way.  The underlying issue is more important in some ways than the specifics, important as they are, of shared and integrated education or other aspects.  We must take reconciliation seriously.  We need peace with reconciliation.<br\/>In looking at reconciliation, one cannot get away from issues around, for example, resources and funding.  The sector that does the work on the ground, the people who must at times deal with pressures, stresses and intimidation because they are trying to move us into a different place, needs resources and support.  I will put it in context.  The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, OFMDFM, the body that is primarily tasked with promoting good relations and reconciliation, has a budget of &pound;13 or &pound;14 million for this, and &pound;2 million is allocated by the Community Relations Council on a regional basis.  I hope I got my zeros right, but I think that amounts to 0.001% of total spend in Northern Ireland.  If we want peace with reconciliation, if we want to support the Good Friday Agreement, the investment in reconciliation must be significantly more than that.  It must be long-term and it must be outcome-focused.<br\/>One must ask whether the commitment in the Government and elsewhere is significant enough when that is the amount of funding that is allocated.  At the minute it is <i>ad hoc<\/i>and piecemeal.  The Governments have done tremendous work recently, for example, the visit of the Queen to Ireland or President Higgins to London.  Those were incredibly positive things and symbolically important events which sent out critical messages.  They showed that peace building and reconciliation are taking place across the islands.<\/p> <p>The really important part of that is ensuring we get it right in Northern Ireland, because that is where relationships are critical to this process and where relationships could sour everything else.  Funding and resourcing in the North for reconciliation is an issue on which we need to refocus.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for giving us this hearing and for its continuing interest in our work.  I reiterate the need for peace with reconciliation, and ask members to continue to consider whether we are adequately resourcing it and supporting the groups involved in it.  As I said, the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council will organise for the committee to take evidence in Belfast from these groups.  That will give members an opportunity to hear from the horse's mouth about the critical work of building the peace and the issues arising in that regard in Belfast and elsewhere in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900011#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, who is very active with various religious groups across the community in the North, has come down specially from the Seanad and would like to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Senator Walsh is welcome to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and apologise for being late.  I am not a member of the committee, but Senator White apprised me of the issues being discussed at this meeting.  The Chairman and I, as members of the Committee on Sovereign Matters of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, have spoken with various groups in the North, and much of what is in the report would not come as any great surprise to us.  I note the delegates homed in on the situation of working class Protestants, the dearth of educational opportunities available to them and the historic lack of value placed on education within that community.  This situation presumably arose out of the discriminatory system that operated in the North for many years and the Protestant community's status as the dominant community, with easy access to work in the shipyards and elsewhere.  Only this morning, I spoke with a former loyalist prisoner who gave the same feedback on this issue.<\/p><p>  Education is key to advancement and an opening of the mind to alternative ways of living.  In the meantime, however, sectarianism seems to be going on unabated in the North.  It is a significant part of what is happening there.  People have, to some extent, reversed to tribal positions and there seems to be very little political leadership in this regard.  If the Executive is not having its hand held, it seems to come apart at the seams.  I understand an attempt is being made - perhaps more on the loyalist side than the Nationalist side - to utilise a lack of education on the part of some people and appeal to the lowest common denominator in order to secure political support.  I do not know how one deals with that.<\/p><p>  The two Governments seem to have become detached from the process.  As the delegates stated, there must be an urgent refocus on and recommitment to pulling it all together and resolving the issues.  That will require a concerted effort.  The problem, here and in Britain, is that both Governments are preoccupied with other issues.  When elections are coming, the attention is not forthcoming which this project requires.  I do not have any great solution other than to say that we might do more on cross-Border engagement and community activities.  Some 32 or 33 years ago, I was involved in a twinning project with Newcastle in County Down.  People got involved in that and several Nationalists told me they could not believe some of the people on the loyalist side who, through their involvement in it, had turned 180 degrees from their original position.  Sometimes we underestimate the potential of that type of community activity.<\/p><p>  What is the delegates' view on the role that can be played by schools?  At a certain point while the violence was still going on, various projects were funded whereby schoolchildren from the two communities would travel together on trips to the United States and Europe.  Those types of initiatives help to sow the seed for a different type of society.  I might be wrong, but there does not seem to be much of that going on these days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Some of the issues the Senator is raising have already been discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00500","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I understand, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00600","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>The final speaker will be Deputy Martin Ferris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900012#N00700","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":800,"content":"<p>The report refers specifically to the problems encountered by young working class Protestant males.

There should be a targeted focus on creating employment opportunities in those areas.  The report refers to the description \"Protestant male\" as being a speed bet for trouble.  Certainly most of the trouble around flags and other issues emanated from east Belfast and, by extension, north Belfast.  Part of the solution has to be around creating jobs in a targeted way for those areas.

Proportionately, however, the need within Protestant working class communities is even more stark.<\/p><p>  Senator Walsh is correct that we must have a strategic approach, encompassing investment within the school gate as well as outside it.  There is a need to look at how communities and families engage with education in schools and with other work within communities that can help to increase the desire of young people from Protestant, Catholic and other backgrounds to work on improvements for themselves by engaging in training and education.  Within the school gate, there also is a need to consider greater investment in those areas where there is clear underachievement.  We need to put more money into schools in disadvantaged areas, on both sides of the community.  There are wider education issues around policy, which we probably do not have time to discuss here.  The figures are very stark for Protestant working class boys.  If we do not turn this around, there is potential for that group to take its frustrations out in many negative ways.

It is worrying that, as the Community Relations Council report states, the moral basis of the 1998 peace accord has evaporated.  The absence of trust is also worrying.  We need to get trust back again.<br\/>I thank the witnesses.  It has been a very useful meeting.  We will try to ensure that we meet with the Community Relations Council on a regular basis, because it represents all the good work that is done.  The committee will visit it in Belfast or elsewhere on an outreach visit to see the local and community groups involved in reconciliation.  Reconciliation is a word that we sometimes put at the back of our minds, but it should be very positive.  <br\/>When one sees the cost of Twaddell Avenue, which I was at as well, and when Ms Gordon talked about the 40% higher unit cost of teacher training in Northern Ireland compared to the UK, these are issues that also need to be addressed.  We will endeavour to seek more funding for very worthwhile projects.  The people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland need to unite.  The issue of politicians going to the lowest common denominator is not unique to Northern Ireland.  We need to unite the people of Ireland and if this committee can be helpful that would be positive. <br\/>On behalf of the committee, I wish the Community Relations Council well in its future work.  It is difficult work that has made a difference, and we want to work with the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014100900013#O00300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412852400,"counter":807,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 12.25 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children","time":1412843400,"counter":808},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Catherine Byrne, Senator Colm Burke, Deputy Ciara Conway, Senator John Crown, Deputy Robert Dowds, Senator Jillian van Turnhout.

I apologise for delaying them up at the beginning.  It was necessary to do a small bit of private business.  As Members will be aware following last week's meeting, there was considerable interest from the media and public and there were many inquiries from members of the public to the office of the committee.  I thank people for taking time to contact us since last week's meeting.  For those who watched the proceedings or read the transcripts of last week, it was a very thought-provoking and interesting meeting.  Many different issues concerning the issue of physical activity, in particular regarding sport, were highlighted.  I will single out Michael Dara Macauley for the ambassadorial role he played which has resonated with people across the county and I thank him for that. <\/p><p>  Before we commence, to remind people on privilege, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if the witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and the witness continues to do so the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of evidence and the witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable and Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p><p>  As this is the first of two parts of today's meeting, I remind Members in particular that we need to have finished the proceedings by 11.20 a.m. because we have to allow time for turning around the room and the equipment.

By definition, it is a complex pathophysiological process in which forces are transmitted to the brain and result in temporary impairment of brain function.  In considering this definition of concussion, there are four key strands to be considered.  Concussion can be caused by either a direct or indirect blow to the face, head, neck or elsewhere in the body with forces transmitted to the head.  Concussion typically results in a rapid onslaught of short-lived impairment of brain function that resolves spontaneously.  In some cases, symptoms can take longer to develop.  Typically, concussion is a functional disturbance rather than a structural disturbance.  Therefore, typically, on neuroimaging such as CAT scan or MRI, there will be no abnormality detected.  Contrary to popular belief prior to an increased awareness of concussion, a person does not need to lose consciousness to have a concussive injury.<\/p><p>  Since 2007, the GAA has focused on raising awareness on concussion in three key areas. These are education and knowledge transfer to our players, coaches, managers, team doctors and physiotherapists, highlighting, in particular, the diagnosis and on-field management of concussion, and the ongoing management of concussion and safe return to play.  In terms of diagnosing concussion, an index of suspicion is required.  The team doctor needs to closely monitor play, in particular collisions.  It is necessary to be able to recognise the symptoms and signs of concussion which can vary from the very obvious to the subtle and hence the difficulties sometimes in diagnosing concussion.  The typical symptoms and signs range from balance difficulties, such as dizziness, to headaches, drowsiness, confusion, irritability, noise and light sensitivity and the more obvious signs and symptoms, such as loss of consciousness or concussive seizure.<\/p> <p>It is the GAA&rsquo;s position stand that if there were a detection of any one of these symptoms or signs, a player must be safely removed from play following medical evaluation.  The player should be brought to the side-line, serially monitored by the team doctor or responsible adult.  If no team doctor is available, they should be brought for immediate medical attention, whether at an accident and emergency department, GP or out-of-hours services.<\/p><p> The GAA has advised that while the use of concussive assessment tools such as SCAT 3, sport concussion assessment tool, are useful in making the diagnosis of concussions and assessing their initial severity, the assessment of the symptoms, neuro-cognition and balance should be done after a 15-minute rest period, therefore excluding the effects of exertion and fatigue.  However, it remains a clinical judgment for a medical doctor.  There is no other diagnosis tool, bar a doctor&rsquo;s medical knowledge.  Hence, the drive by the GAA to educate our playing population, coaching staff, team doctors and physiotherapists.<\/p><p> With regard to return to play, the cornerstone of concussion management is physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve.  Typically in uncomplicated cases, the acute symptoms resolve after a rest period of 24 to 48 hours.  Our protocol following a concussion follows a step-wise process where a player should only continue to proceed to the next level if asymptomatic at the current level.  Generally, each step would take 24 hours.<\/p><p> The GAA has taken on board the consensus expert opinion on concussion and the advice from our medical opinion to advocate and adopt a much more conservative return to play in our child and adolescent population where the emphasis is on return to learn and safe schooling.  For the five to 12 year old cohort of players, we have adopted a minimum rest period of two weeks and the child SCAT 3 as an assessment and management tool for concussion.<\/p><p> Other modifying issues that we have discussed at length and at education meetings with our team doctors that may predict longer return to play are more serious or persistent concussion symptoms, players who suffer recurrent concussion injuries, players who have suffered a loss of consciousness for greater than one minute as part of their concussion injury, concussion injuries that occur repeatedly with less traumatic force and being aware of the comorbidities of players who suffer from migraine, depression or children with attention deficit disorder or learning disabilities.<\/p><p> The GAA has adopted and advocated a comprehensive educational tool since 2007 that is in keeping with best practice internationally and we continually review for players, managers and team doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sean Moffatt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412844000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>In 2007, the GAA produced a position statement on concussion and this position was subsequently updated in 2013.  A multifaceted educational programme was devised earlier this year which aims to transfer knowledge to players, coaches, parents, referees, administrators and medical personnel on concussion, as well as the GAA&rsquo;s guidelines in this regard.  This programme comprises concussion workshops, seminars, a specific e-learning course and information leaflets designed to get to as wide an audience as possible.<\/p><p>  The GAA has teamed up with Acquired Brain Injury Ireland on awareness campaigns which saw posters being distributed to each club, video campaigns featuring high-profile players and wallet cards being produced for coaches.  The association has operated a national injury database since 2007 in conjunction with the University College Dublin&rsquo;s School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science.  It informs us on the incidence of concussion injuries associated with playing senior inter-county football and hurling, while trends in numbers and impact of such injuries can be monitored and reported.<\/p><p>  The GAA has worked closely with the Gaelic Players Association, Gaelic Games Doctors Association, UPMC Beacon Hospital and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our guidelines are up to date.  The GAA recommends consideration be given to establish a task force with representations from sports organisations, sports medicine bodies and primary and post-primary schools to devise an appropriate educational programme to improve awareness of sports-related concussion, its management and possible consequences among players, parents, coaches and medics.<\/p><p>  The GAA believes there is scope to provide education and training for all GPs, out-of-hour GP services and accident and emergency departments in post-traumatic brain injury assessment and management to limit the chance of players receiving varying advice.  There is scope also for additional research.<\/p><p>  The most important message for all stakeholders is that players with symptoms that indicate a concussion be removed from play - If in doubt, sit them out.  Thereafter, appropriate management is essential for reducing the risk of long-term symptoms and complications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1412844000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I call on Dr. Rod McLoughlin of the IRFU, the Irish Rugby Football Union, to make his opening statement.

I am here in my capacity as head of medical services with the IRFU.  I am also director of medicine at the Irish Institute of Sport and medical officer at the Olympic Council of Ireland, as well as having been a member of the GAA&rsquo;s medical scientific and welfare committee.<\/p><p>  Medical information about concussion in sport has already been presented to this committee.  For this reason, I will present how the IRFU is managing concussion in rugby.  Concussion education and management sits at the very top of the IRFU&rsquo;s player welfare strategy aimed at educating, supporting and protecting players at all levels of the game.  The strategic vision of the IRFU is that all players, coaches, referees and medical personnel involved in rugby union understand the importance of concussion, how to recognise concussion and manage it, therefore enhancing player welfare.  The union is providing leadership to change the culture in rugby.  The culture to which we aspire is one in which concussion is considered a serious injury, actively monitored for, recognised and proactively managed with player safety the ultimate consideration.  We are working to achieve this vision and culture change by concussion education, regulation, prevention, management and research.<\/p><p>  Education is at the heart of driving awareness and cultural change.  The IRFU is delivering its educational programme in concussion roadshows.  Almost 2,000 people have attended 54 concussion roadshow talks nationwide.  Almost 900 participants have attended one of 46 SAFE rugby courses, a one-day practical course with one instructor to every six participants.  These courses include concussion management protocols, basic life support, defibrillator training and first-aid management of sport injuries.  Up to 30,000 concussion education wallet cards and posters were distributed last season to every club and school in July 2013 and January 2014.  The medical section of the IRFU website was redesigned with educational content on concussion.  We are developing child-friendly material.  The IRFU's medical staff has presented educational talks to the emergency medicine, sports and GP doctors.  The IRFU is targeting schools, adolescent children, coaches and referees with educational material specific to each group to inform them of their role in concussion management with specific guidance for each.<\/p><p>  Rugby recognises the association between concussion and CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  Regulation which includes mandatory components, coupled with strong education, is key to mitigating the risks.  Concussion management strategies have been supported and reinforced by the following mandatory components.  The IRFU introduced mandatory time out of the game for those with a suspected or confirmed concussion of 21 days for adults and 23 days at underage level.  All coaches attending an IRFU coaching course must complete an online concussion educational module.  Club and school funding has been linked to completion of concussion education by coaches.  Referees report all concussion and suspected cases of concussion in the Ulster Bank League.<\/p><p>  In the area of prevention, coaches are being educated on proper tackle techniques and appropriate training schedules, while referees are being educated on their role in injury prevention and the dangers of foul play.  A medically supervised graduated return-to-play protocol that recognises the importance of treating youths more conservatively is at the heart of our approach.<\/p><p>  The IRFU operates a zero-tolerance stance towards playing with concussion or suspected concussion.  The message is, Stop &ndash; Inform &ndash; Rest &ndash; Return.<\/p> <p>Any player with any symptoms of concussion must be removed and cannot return to play that day.  Under IRB law 3.9, the referee may order an injured player to leave the playing area.  Referees have been reminded of their powers under this law and its use in suspected concussion.<\/p><p> The IRFU is continually updating its concussion management strategy in line with new developments in this evolving area of sports medicine.  We are at all times guided by the Zurich guidelines of 2012 and ongoing research.  As I have already said, we have introduced mandatory time out of the game for those with a suspected or confirmed concussion and the linking of funding to coach education and we are monitoring compliance with these things.  The IRFU is also developing bespoke adult education videos for Irish coaches.  <\/p><p> Research drives IRFU&rsquo;s concussion policies.  The IRFU is currently supporting a study of schools rugby injuries, including concussion, in Ulster rugby.  The union have developed an online reporting system to allow referees to advise us on any suspected or confirmed concussions during a game in the all-Ireland league.  This enables us to audit the incidences and engage directly with the player and the club to ensure they follow the return to play guidelines.  The research will inform the IRFU about how effective our concussion strategy has been and guide future developments in concussion management.  <\/p><p> We recommend the following considerations.  They include the development and distribution of concussion education material throughout the schools system and the development of \"return to learn\" guidelines for schools, similar to the return to sport guidelines and education of teachers and parents on the importance of this part of management.  We have \"return to sport\" guidelines but we do not have any \"return to learn\" guidelines.  Other recommendations include concussion education and training of all medical personnel who are involved in managing this issue, improved access to specialist care and a consensus on minimum return to play timelines across all sports nationally.<\/p><p> The IRFU is leading the drive to change the culture within Irish rugby with regard to concussion and its management.  The union has been proactive in driving a concussion awareness campaign, which has been underpinned by an initial broad-based educational programme.  This is now moving to focused education at multiple levels of the game supported by mandatory components.  The IRFU operates a zero tolerance stance towards playing rugby with concussion and the message to all is \"Stop - Inform - Rest - Return\".  The IRFU has been proactive in its management and continues to evolve its strategic approach to managing concussion which is based on the most up-to-date scientific evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rod McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412844600,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Hassanien wish to make his opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900005#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412844600,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for allowing me to speak on the hugely important area of concussion in sport.  To provide some degree of background, I am a former professional player who currently acts in the role of chief executive of the Irish Rugby Union Players' Association, IRUPA, a body whose underlying mandate is to protect and promote all aspects of player welfare in the professional side of the game in Ireland.  To be clear, IRUPA is a body that sits independently from the IRFU, employing a primary focus of protecting players' interests whilst also promoting the broader game.<\/p><p>  In addition to my domestic obligations to the Irish professional player group, I also act as a director on the board of the International Rugby Players' Association &ndash; a role that is perhaps more relevant here given the global nature of the issue.  While I do not come from a medical background, my experiences both as player and my involvement in these collective player representative bodies would hopefully qualify me to offer a unique perspective in this area.<\/p><p>  This forum presents us with a wonderful opportunity to analyse the issue of concussion not only in promoting the dangers of mistreating head injuries from a medical perspective but also in discussing the mechanisms by which we are promoting education and awareness in our respective sports.  Generating this awareness is crucial with respect to those within the sport as well as members of the broader public who play the game and who idolise those in the professional game - looking up to them as role models.  <\/p><p>  While my colleague, Dr Rod McLoughlin, has spoken more about the management and research side of concussion, I will focus more so on the educational and awareness building side.  Also, while Dr McLoughlin has addressed the game of rugby in its entirety, I will be focusing on the professional game only &ndash; the group of players for which we are responsible as a players' association.  <\/p><p>  Education and general awareness are such important aspects here as essentially they are the keys to mitigating risk.  When addressing this aspect, it is important to recognise that we are talking about a cultural change of attitude, which Dr. McLoughlin has also touched on.  Along with educating medics at the highest level, all other stakeholders including players, coaches, management and referees must understand their respective roles in the ongoing management of head injuries.<\/p><p>  The education of players is critical in driving the overall cultural shift required here.  IRUPA works closely with the IRFU in ensuring that players are well aware of the risks.  During the most recent 12-month period, the IRFU, with the involvement and cooperation of IRUPA, has been around to all provinces in Ireland taking leading neurosurgeons with it to provide the players with an in-depth presentation on concussions, the symptoms and effects.  Additionally, wallet cards have been issued and informative posters are at the respective provincial training bases.  In its quarterly magazine, IRUPA promotes awareness of the potential long-term effects of head injury mismanagement so we are constantly trying to inform our players.  <\/p><p>  We also believe that there must always be a focus on loud vocal messaging from the right type of people.  Obviously, the medical advisers in the sport need to be active here but equally and perhaps even more significantly, it involves the senior players themselves speaking out and breaking down long-held attitudes of \"tough it out\" and \"you'll be right\" that perhaps have been culturally embedded in the past prior to us developing the knowledge we have today about concussion.  Players being vocal is perhaps the quickest and most effective way of breaking this down.  <\/p><p>  As an indicator of how productive these educational measures have been in the past two to three years, we can refer back to an IRFU survey carried out in the 2011-2012 season.  Of those players who said they suffered from concussion and remained on the field, 95% did so because they did not think concussion was a serious issue.  Only two years later after the work carried out by the IRFU, we conducted our own survey which revealed that 80% of the players were now concerned about concussion &ndash; a statistical turnaround that was no doubt based on increased awareness campaigns in the sport both globally and domestically.<\/p><p>  Moving on to other stakeholders in the sport, it is important to emphasise the importance of team coaches and management in this.  Under no circumstances should these people have any influence over the decision of whether to remove a player from the field or not.  The game has addressed this by not only educating coaches about the dangers of head injury mistreatment but also by linking it to performance.  Leading medical experts in rugby are constantly preaching to coaches that a team's best player concussed is not as effective as a lesser player who is not concussed.  They have supported this statement by highlighting video evidence of even mildly concussed players who show an inability to perform the more fundamental skills such as running the right support lines in attack or aligning in defence.  The management of coaches is another crucial area in this cultural progression.<\/p><p>  The role of the referee in the responsible treatment of head injuries should also not be understated.  Often the referee is in a better position than anyone to see the impact of a collision at close range - sometimes even better than the use of video technology, which may not pick everything up.  As Dr. McLoughlin mentioned, IRB regulation 3.9 gives the referee the power to remove players from the field of play.  Referees should not be afraid to exercise this right for fear of the repercussions that removing an influential player might have.  Quite simply, the health of the individual must take priority in all cases.<\/p><p>  The IRB educates elite medical staff around the rugby world in various ways.  In November of each year, it hosts its annual medical forum and medical advisors from all international teams are invited to Dublin to listen to leading practitioners present.  I have personally attended this conference the past two years and have found it to be a very informative and interactive environment.  The IRB Player welfare website, which is dedicated strictly to player welfare, has a very clearly laid out \"Learn Online\" concussion management tool in which medically trained visitors to the site can enter the interactive learning modules at various stages.  There are modules for doctors, match day medical staff and elite match day medical staff.  There is also a module available for the general public to access.<\/p><p>  I will speak very briefly about the management of concussion in professional rugby.  I will not speak for too long as Dr. McLoughlin has addressed this area, as did Dr. Falvey last week on behalf of the IRFU.  Rugby is at all times guided by the Zurich guidelines of 2012, which we believe to be best practice in this area.  Under the guidance of IRB Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Martin Raftery, the IRB has managed a working party over the past two years dedicated to pitch side concussion assessment, which is now referred to as head injury assessment.  We as a players' association internationally have had a seat on that throughout.  The fact that rugby has come out and recognised the association between concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, is a positive step.  While a conclusive link may not be formed at this point in time, the fact that an association or potential association has been recognised in the US is positive in bringing a focus to this matter.<\/p><p>  As players, we also acknowledge that the game is adopting a strong preventative policy.<\/p> <p>Rugby has shown itself to be a world leader in the promotion of correct playing techniques, as well as the implementation of laws that ensure that dangerous play - such as high tackles and tip tackles - is outlawed from the game as best possible.  We compliment the IRB and the IRFU for giving this greater focus they have placed on this matter in recent years.<\/p><p> At professional level in Ireland, the IRFU complies with all guidelines set out by the IRB and takes a very serious approach to the management of concussion, particularly in the past few years.  The IRFU has implemented an instantaneous video review system at all home international matches, which allows their medical advisors to assess the mechanics of the injury at that point in time and thus hopefully better understand the severity of that particular concussion on the spot.  This puts them in a leading position throughout Europe in this regard and is a strong step forward from a player-welfare perspective.<\/p><p> The role of the players association in respect of all of this could be described as being twofold - first, understanding and influencing players and, second, interacting with the governing bodies of the sport.  In the context of understanding players, our role is to represent them in a number of capacities.  No matter how we represent them, we take on the role of being the key influence on many occasions.  We are able to influence and shape opinion on the general approach to particular matters.  With respect to managing head injuries, we educate our players in understanding their role in society and the degree to which they are revered as role models by a generation of youngsters.  Players need to understand how closely their actions are being watched and, for this reason, they should not be seen publicly to be having any influence over medical staff in trying to remain on the field of play.  They need to demonstrate, through both words and actions, that the entire decision is in the hands of the medical advisers.  In order to understand our players better, last year we completed a survey of our membership specifically in the area of concussion.  In the past month we have issued our more extensive biennial survey to players which questions them on all aspects of their employment.  Concussion is obviously an important part of this survey in the context of the questions asked.  We are awaiting the results of the survey, which will be processed by an independent body over the next month.<\/p><p> Our interaction with the governing bodies is sometimes conducted by me or by other members of the staff of IRUPA.  On other occasions it is conducted through industry leaders.  We employ Dr. Niall Hogan as our medical representative of the players and he acts as a conduit between ourselves and medical experts in the game such Dr. McLoughlin.  At international level we as a collective international player body and, as stated earlier, we are involved in the IRB working parties.  We have also been involved in concussion education videos with the IRB as part of the \"Recognise and Remove\" programme.  Overall, our role in interacting with the governing bodies of the game is critical to both parties.  The players need to be well informed and represented by their associations in this process and equally the governing bodies of the sport need to understand player attitudes and how they view this all important area.<\/p><p> As representatives of the players, we welcome being invited to forums such as this in order to discuss the important player welfare issue of concussion.  We also welcome any studies and research which might lead to further advances in this particular area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Omar Hassanien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412845200,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hassanein.

A boxer will not be allowed to partake in competition or in full training-sparring sessions until he or she receives a medical record book from the association.  This book is used to record any competitive bouts the boxer is involved in and any medical information that would need to be recorded about the said boxer, including any periods the boxer has been restricted from taking part in competition or sparring.  This book will accompany the boxer for the duration of his or her domestic boxing career.<\/p><p>  The IABA is governed by the International Amateur Boxing Association, AIBA, or the world body for amateur boxing.  Historically, the IABA self-regulated but was also governed by the AIBA.  In the early 1970s, the relevant rules - which are listed at appendix 8 of my presentation - were introduced into Irish boxing.  The AIBA in its Medical Handbook for Boxing, Eighth Edition, 2013, has set down rules in respect of concussion.  The IABA is obliged to comply with AIBA rules and is happy to do so as they are strong than those which were previously in place.  If the committee so desires, I can read out the relevant rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joe McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1412845200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Or Dr. McKeever could summarise them if he so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900006#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412845200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Provision is made for minimal suspension periods after knockouts.  If a boxer suffers a knockout with as a result of blows to the head or if the bout is stopped by the referee because the boxer has received heavy blows to the head, then the boxer may not take part in boxing or sparring for a period of at least 30 days afterward.  If there is a loss of consciousness for less than one minute, the boxer may not take part in boxing or sparring for a period of at least 90 days afterward.  If there is a loss of consciousness for than one minute, the boxer may not take part in boxing or sparring for a period of at least 180 days afterward.  If, during a period of 90 days after a boxer's suspension for knockout, the boxer is knocked out a second time or if the referee stops a contest as a result of the number of heavy blows received to the head, then the boxer may not take part in boxing or sparring for a period of 90 days after the second occurrence.  If the first suspension was 90 days, the repeat suspension will be 180 days.  If the first suspension was 180 days, the new suspension will be 365 days.<\/p><p>  Every year, each boxer who is set to represent Ireland in international competition must take an annual medical screening.  All details of these screenings are recorded in the AIBA medical and competition record book for boxers.  These medical booklets or passports contain the history of all individual bouts undertaken by boxers at international level and a history of all previous medical checks.  Three months prior to every major international competition - the European and world championships and the Olympics - each boxer must undergo a medical by the IABA-registered doctor.  Boxers are also fully medically examined at the weigh-in at international competitions and are passed to compete at competition. Before a boxer enters the ring for each competitive bout, a doctor will examine and make a decision on whether the boxer is medically fit to take part in the bout.  As he or she leaves the ring, the medical doctor will always check the fighter again at ringside before he or she returns to the dressing room.<\/p><p>  The IABA is of the view that all sporting organisations should report to a specific centre for concussion and be kept updated by same on advances in respect of detection or on regulatory matters regarding concussion in sport.  The primary objective in the IABA's medical rules is to reduce the risk of severe injury and limit the long-term effects of repeated brain injury.  The organisation has an excellent track record with regard to the control of boxers access to competitions as their medical record books must record all prior fight results.  As members will appreciated, there is a need to ensure that a physician be available to oversee all national and international boxing championships.  The IABA has adopted the AIBA rulings with regard to boxer exclusion following a concussion superseding its own measures that were in place since the 1970s.  However, the need for a suspended boxer to have a MRI scan gives rise to a financial cost which may be difficult for all boxers to meet.  We hope to be able to secure public funding to cover this increased financial burden.<\/p><p>  Vigilance is the watch word of the IABA in regard to signs of serious head injury of any boxer in competition.  The rules I have set out not only preclude participation in boxing competitions, they also exclude a boxer from sparring while training at his or her club or with his or her squad.<\/p> <p>These rules, introduced in the mid-1970s, have proved to be far-sighted and ahead of their time. This is evidenced by the fact that no AIBA boxer has suffered a severe head or brain injury in the last 40 years.  Finally the medical examination now required to be undertaken before a suspended boxer is allowed to compete has been upgraded by IABA to take into account advances in medical imaging.  As set out in the AIBA rule, an MRI or CT scan is required before a boxer is re-licensed following suspension.  The IABA remains open to any suggestions that may improve the health and safety of its boxers as a result of medical research and studies carried out across a range of other contact sports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joe McKeever","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412845800,"counter":828,"content":"<p>As honorary medical officer to Horse Sport Ireland, I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me to present on concussion in equestrian sport.  In 2006, I was appointed to first medical committee of the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Equestre Internationale, FEI, the international equestrian federation based in Lausanne which oversees all equestrian sports across the world.  This committee was chaired by the late Craig Ferrall, who had a particular interest in concussion, and during my term of office it became very aware, from evidence-based medicine, that all concussion is serious and the terms \"mild\" or \"moderate\" concussion are no longer acceptable in medical circles.  As a result, we introduced legislation with a mandatory suspension following any diagnosis of concussion and also making wearing of protective head gear compulsory.  This has gone through right across the world in the various countries subject to the FEI.  Horse Sport Ireland is unique in this sporting sphere, in that it encompasses many different disciplines of equestrian sport.  It involves somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 competing individuals on an annual basis, but with an enormous range of age, capabilities and experience.  We have four year old children on lead rein ponies and we have people up to 100 years of age breeding horses for competition.  It also embraces those who do not compete and who are involved with horses for leisure, pleasure, or commerce.<\/p><p>  The FEI has advised on risk-management policy.  Helmets are mandatory at all times and fortunately we have adopted a standard, which Dr. Adrian McGoldrick last week said he aspired to for all racing people, kite-marks on competitors' helmets, so that they are checked regularly.  Cross-country competitors must wear medical armbands.  These armbands show not only the individual rider's name, contact number and next of kin, but also their previous medical history, in particular any history of concussion or falls, any medications they are taking and any allergies they might have.  If a horse or rider falls, they must leave the field of competition - hopefully walking and not on a stretcher - and they are not allowed to re-mount until seen by a medical officer.  All falls are recorded in a medical book at events and a record of these falls is maintained by the individual disciplines within the sport.  Competitors and horses are monitored regularly by stewards at competitions to ensure that they are competing at a level for which they are qualified and capable.  Stewards are advised that they may tell people, parents or individual competitors that they should be downgraded if necessary for their own safety.  Tack and saddlery must be of a safe standard and are inspected regularly.  The field of competition and courses are also checked by stewards and must be passed safe for competition.<\/p><p>  Diagnosis of concussion has also been dealt with very specifically by various medical professionals, both this morning and in the last session, but it is important to get through to competitors, riders and members that concussion is an alteration in brain function secondary to trauma.  It is not structural damage and may not be obvious.  We use the SCAT tools, which were very eloquently dealt with in last week's meeting.  This SCAT tool is not an expensive piece of medical equipment, but rather a sensible series of questions put to the patient - for example what horse they were riding, which fence they fell at, etc. - and clinical observations.  We have put a copy of this in the cover of the more recent medical books, so that medical officers and paramedics can refer to it.  The importance of diagnosing concussion cannot be stressed enough because the real problem is ensuring that patients or riders have a sufficient recovery-rest period.  An interesting North American study has shown that those who suffer brain injury and concussion and are undiagnosed and not allowed to rest are three times more likely to have a second episode within a year.  Those who have a second episode are eight times more likely to sustain a third during that period.<\/p><p>  Return to sport is therefore very important.  Competitors sustaining concussion are given printed information on head injuries.  Most doctors acting at an event will carry these, but in case they do not have them we are now putting them into the medical books which go around from one event to another.  Those who have sustained a concussion are not allowed to ride on the day of diagnosis because suspension for 21 days is mandatory.  This suspension can be amended to ten days if the rider is asymptomatic and is passed fit by a qualified medical practitioner.  The suspension can be reduced to seven days if the rider has had previous neurogenic or psychometric  testing and attains that level.  Unfortunately, very few - in fact, none that I know of - in Irish sport have actually had psychometric testing.  This is because of both the cost and the difficulty in having it done.  All suspensions are recorded in a rider's medical armband and repeated episodes of concussion must be reviewed by a consultant neurologist.<\/p><p>  Education, as my colleagues said earlier, is of the utmost importance.  We must educate riders, handlers, parents, trainers, coaches and medical officers of the significance of concussion.  Our coaches must undergo an equine-related first aid session before qualification as coaches, and this entails a module on concussion.  We must ensure that our medical officers and paramedics are always in attendance and that medical records are kept in date.  This is something to which we very seriously aspire in Horse Sport Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Flannery"},{"type":"speech","time":1412845800,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flannery and all our witnesses this morning for their excellent presentations.

It strikes me - and I can be corrected on this - that boxing and horse sports each have very specific rules applying that are immediately enforceable, and I commend that.  Individual performances in these sports are perhaps, from my layperson's perspective, easier to follow, and to identify where an issue may present or may have presented.  As a result, my questions will concentrate a little more on the team sports, where we are dealing with a much greater platform.  We are talking about a pitch.  It is a very big area, and one is not always able to see everything in quite the same focused way that one can in boxing and various horse sport activities.  The poor referee, if too much responsibility is placed on one set of shoulders, will also not be able to do so.<\/p> <p> I put my hand up as a parent.  My young lad would be of a mind, as are many young people wanting to excel in what they undertake, that the helmet is a protection, but it was said to us here last week that it only protects the scalp.  The helmet has no protective value in regard to the brain and offers no protection against the potential consequences of a severe impact.  They might take up on that point.  Is that impressed on players of all ages because it undoubtedly gives that extra degree of self-assurance, bravery and willingness to go the extra distance to put oneself in the gap of danger?<\/p><p> I thank the GAA.  Dr. Flannery described well that this is a functional disturbance rather than a structure injury.  For a lay person, it is immediately understandable.  That simple phrase tells us all about this matter and how difficulty it is to identify.<\/p><p> When talking about those in charge, Dr. Moffat and Mr. Ryan state in their presentation that where a team doctor is present, he should advise the person in charge.  Often that might not be a single person.  Is it the practice that there is an identified person in charge who makes the call?  We do not always have team doctors.  Certainly, in juvenile football, it is not always the case.  Who is the person in charge?  Who, in the absence of a doctor, has that responsibility?  In my own ignorance of everything, I learned last week that SCAT 3 was a piece of paper.  This has been an informative exchange, even to that extent.  With no biomarkers to make a diagnosis, what instruction can one give to that person in charge?<\/p><p> Dr. Moffat and Mr. Ryan state that certain individuals believe the GAA should relax substitution rules.  I would think that such is a common sense approach to deal with the issue of having to assess, if it is at all possible to assess definitively, a suspected case of concussion.  There are only X substitutions over the course of the game.  It puts enormous pressure on the team mentors and players.  Without question, in the heat of play there is an unwillingness to come off to let the side down.  If there was a relaxation on substitution, that might take some of the pressure off.  There might be a greater willingness for compliance in relation to coming off the field of play where a suspected concussion has taken place.  I wonder would they elaborate on that.  Are there prospects of that being done?<\/p><p> There seems to be a slight difference between the GAA and the IRFU or, in this instance, the Irish Rugby Union players' Association, as to who that person in charge might be.  Of course, I get the sense that the referee has a role to play but the GAA presentation seems to place some degree of responsibility on making the call to the person in charge whereas it is clear from the presentation this morning from the rugby fraternity that, \"Under no circumstances should ... [team coaches and management] have any influence over the decision of whether to remove a player from the field or not\".  Am I reading correctly that they believe it is the referee, wholly and solely, who should make the call in this regard?  It is open to that interpretation.  I invite Mr. Hassanien and Dr. McLoughlin to elaborate on that point.  The IRUPA presentation states that the referee has the power to remove players from the field of play whose health he or she believes in is danger, and there seems to be that reliance.  On a last point to the rugby representatives, the recognised association between concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy is not conclusive but would Dr. McLoughlin elaborate on that and give us a greater understanding of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900007#G00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412846400,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  It builds on the presentations we heard last week also.  We are on a journey of learning on this.<\/p><p>  Using the experience from the United States, we learned last week that the protocol is that an independent person will make the decision.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to that also.  I am confused with the different sports about exactly who is making the decision because I hear different stresses on who exactly is making it.  How does one deal with off-the-ball tackles, especially in team sports?  One can say it is the referee but when the incident is not where the referee is watching, how does one deal with those instances?<\/p><p>  We are dealing with the elite sporting levels and I am also concerned about how that filters down into the practice and culture of schools, clubs and counties so that the same culture and roles exist.  One of the proposals put to us last week was that there should be training on pitch-side injuries but that a similar training would be given.  I am concerned, if each of the sports is developing its own training, that often someone who is volunteering at a school or club level may volunteer with other sports and there may be slight differences in approach which could lead to problems.  Last week we heard examples about New Zealand and South Africa.  In New Zealand, there is one certification.  How do we ensure that there is a consistent message for dealing with pitch-side injuries so that, whatever the sport, the same approach will be given?  I believe that at the top level it will be looked after.  I am more concerned that, at the schools and clubs level, the same approach filters down.<\/p><p>  The mandatory reporting of injuries was raised with us last week.  Dr. McKeever mentioned a reporting centre for concussion.  How would that be done?  Dr. Flannery mentioned that they keep their records but they are kept by the individual disciplines.  One point we learned last week is that we do not have enough evidence and records to build up a picture of Ireland.  How should we bring all those records together?  Is it a matter for a sporting body or must we set up something else?  As a legislator and policy-maker, I am asking for direction.  What should we look for when we are making our final report?<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also raised the issue of helmets.  It was interesting for us to hear last week about the risk compensation that sometimes a young person may make because he or she has a helmet on.  I am also concerned about the issue of bulking up.  I have seen it in rugby in the past ten years since the sport has become professional, but we have also seen it in the GAA.  I am concerned about the sale of products, particularly to children.  We heard last week that it is all about nutrition, but at the weekend I returned to the sports shops and they do not mention nutrition.  There are sporting heroes linked to these bulking-up products, including protein and creatine.  I have a problem with that.  I take issue with it and I wonder is there something that we should be doing as well.  Whether it is the helmet or the bulking up, it makes players feel they are more invincible which will change the nature of the sport and lead to more cases of concussion because it makes for a much more barging-through type of play.<\/p><p>  Do the witnesses believe legislation us needed and that we as legislators should be doing something?<\/p> <p>Last week we were told to wait for two or three years to allow the different bodies to bring in their own rules and see how that goes.  I would certainly be interested to hear whether there is something we should be doing at a national level, on a legislative basis or at policy level.  Is there anything that the witnesses would ask we ensure is in our final report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900008#H00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412847000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  Over the course of last week's and today's discussions, we have been learning a lot about concussion in sport.  A number of issues came up during the discussions.  It is obvious that we need clear protocols to adhere to best practice and that there are no national structures or guidelines available in schools.  Many other issues also came up regarding, for example, proper concussion clinics and the need to set up an international centre of excellence, the lack of neurosurgeons and the lack of science around it all - how to recognise and treat concussion.  It is also necessary to invest in education.  Who do the witnesses think should be responsible for rolling out the awareness and education programmes?  Should it be the schools, the sporting bodies, the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills?  Who should ensure that a player is forced to leave the field following concussion or suspected concussion?  We have heard about the team doctors and medics, but they are really only available at the highest level.  Up and down the country week in, week out it is either coaches or parents who are responsible for many of the juvenile teams.  We mentioned the SCAT3 test.  Are all parents and coaches trained in first aid and if they are carrying a first aid kit to a match, do they have a copy of this SCAT3 paper?  If it is used, how is the data collated?  I believe there is no national database either.  How often is the SCAT3 test taken, particularly at lower level?  Would the witnesses agree that all parents and coaches should be trained in first aid?  The GAA has been rolling out education programmes since 2007 and I believe they have an app now that most clubs can use.  However in the all-Ireland final of last year, one of the players played the last 20 minutes concussed.  Were all the guidelines adhered to on that day?  Was the SCAT3 test taken?  If so, how come he did not come off the pitch and how come the concussion was not identified?  Regarding boxing and equestrian sports, the protocols and rules are very clearly identified.  I go to a lot of boxing tournaments as I have a fierce interest in the sport and am actually attending a match on Saturday night - Katie Taylor is going to be boxing in Fermoy.  Perhaps concussion is easier to identify when there is a referee and two players, but I do like the idea of the medical record books.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900009#J00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1412847000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have been very lucky over the years in that I have been involved in a lot of sport and have received no serious injuries, except for four months ago when I fell off my bike and broke my hip - these things do happen.  My focus is players' concerns.  Players have to be educated and informed about the research and the culture change.  As far as I am concerned there are two types of sports - the sports for the elite professionals like the Gaelic players who represent their country and go over to Australia or the rugby players or the boxers.  To me that is the elite.  They seem to be the ones who are being looked after most of the time.  The people who are my concern would be the amateurs, club players like wee boxing clubs in very small towns or horse riding clubs.  I think they are the ones that should be looked after really well.  The committee received a letter from Mr. Cliff Beirne, who is a consultant surgeon in the sports clinic in Santry.  When I started to read through his letter, I realised that the media is getting all these reports and there is nothing really being done about it.  He stated that concussion is a traumatic brain injury.  We all accept that.  Repetitive concussion may result long term in degenerative brain diseases.  In this country we have seen a lot of bad incidents over the last years.  I will mention a few examples if the Chairman will allow it.

There was also a young rugby schoolboy who tragically died from second impact syndrome, and a young schoolboy from Tralee who, if not for the prompt action of his mother in bringing him immediately to hospital, would have had extremely adverse outcomes.  Most referees get paid to referee a game and look after the game.  I think it is the referee's responsibility to take action if a person takes any kind of a knock.  This year we have had fantastic weather and the grounds have all been very hard.  I am sure there has been a lot of hard and heavy hitting and falling.  Sport is played in a good way, but someone has to look after the amateurs, like the GAA, rugby, boxing; there is plenty of money there.  These people have given up their time for absolutely nothing for the love of the sport.  It is very important that a referee reports the incident.  If the referee, manager, a person on the sidelines, or a player gets any kind of impact he or she should automatically be sent to the local accident and emergency clinic or the minor injuries unit.  It is the responsibility of that organisation to monitor the situation going forward.  Concussion is getting to be a big thing at the moment.  When we saw Brian O'Driscoll getting the wallop in the Six Nations we all panicked that our chances might be gone.  Concussion is a big thing.  A large number of people and voluntary organisations are putting the effort into it.

One of the very precise recommendations from the GAA concerns setting up a task force.  Has the GAA been in correspondence with the relevant Departments on that matter, and has it received a response?  If a task force involving all the sports organisations is set up, which Department would be most appropriate for it to come under?  This area covers the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and a number of others.  There is no point in it being answerable to a number of different Departments because that will not work.  The GAA's recommendations are very well and very precisely set out.  Mr. Ryan referred to the public health campaigns in Canada and the United States.  If we were to do a public health campaign in Ireland, which one should be prioritised and fast-tracked that would be effective and would be of benefit for everyone involved in sport?  <\/p><p>  My last question concerns rural areas in particular.  It is not physically possible for every sports club to have a medic available immediately.  Where an event takes place 30 to 50 miles from the nearest hospital, is there any procedure in place to ensure that it is known where the nearest available medic is and who is on call before the start of the match?  Many GPs are not on call at weekends.  One is dependent on the call-out service from hospitals.  Is there any procedure available for clubs to see where the nearest person who can be summoned to give assistance is, should something serious happen?<\/p> <p>While all the clubs have people with training and expertise, sometimes additional assistance is required.

While I am not primarily a rugby fan, over recent years, I have been impressed by the obvious attention the sports organisations, especially rugby, have paid to the safety of players.  Apart from motor sports, I guess rugby and equestrian sports were historically the two leading causes of seriously neurologically damaging sports injuries in the British Isles, particularly neck, spine and brain injuries.  Obviously, the responsibility of the sporting organisations ends when a medical decision is made that a person needs medical care.  In Ireland, we have a more serious problem with our system&rsquo;s ability to deal with head injuries.  We have very few neurosurgical units.  They are bizarrely centralised.  Huge hospitals that designate themselves as major trauma centres are not equipped to do rudimentary brain surgery following somebody falling off a ladder or in a pub, or suffering a head injury while playing rugby, soccer or Gaelic football.<\/p><p>  Are the witnesses happy with the level of service they get in general following the decision that somebody needs to be referred for specialist hospital-based assessment acutely?  Are they happy with the availability of scans?  From my practice I know that in some cases the waiting list for scans appears to be longer than the life expectancy of the illness one suspects the patient may have.  I would be especially interested to know if anyone who sits on an international body has any sense as to whether our system is as agile and flexible in dealing with these demands as other, somewhat more sophisticated medical systems.<\/p><p>  I have a particular question for Mr. McKeever.  People who are on the interface of medicine and boxing face this argument constantly.  Boxing is a special case in that the sport has gone to great efforts to ensure the safety of its participants.  However, one can win a boxing match by killing one's opponent or by knocking one's opponent down and causing brain injury.  To knock the person out is one of the ways to win at boxing.

All disciplines of equestrian sport are governed by the Horse Sport Ireland board, which holds all the records, which are available for scrutiny.  It would be very easy for each sport to have a stated policy on concussion.  Funding for sport in this country, under the Irish Sports Council, is dependent on each sport being signed up to the World Anti-Doping Authority, WADA.  Equally, perhaps sporting organisations that do not have concussion policies should not get any money either.

However, with regard to helmets in boxing, they do not prevent concussion but prevent blood injuries that often look quite dramatic but actually are quite trivial.  There is, if anything, a move towards the removal of helmets, which I believe we probably will see in the context of the Commonwealth Games of 2014.

The radiology and the safeguards are evolving and improving all the time and therefore these rules will evolve.  As they do, there probably will be a new mandatory radiological test, which I believe would transcend boxing and would apply to any sport, be it football or rugby.

Consequently, there is always a clearly identifiable person in charge and the guideline to coaches, referees and parents is to go to that person in charge.  As part of our guidelines and our training, this point is made clear to referees, that is, they can insist that somebody be removed from play by going to the person in charge of a team.  Related to this at intercounty level, where one always will have a team doctor present, if that team doctor suspects concussion, it is his or her duty to go to the person in charge, namely, the team manager, who must act on the doctor's instructions in that regard.  The incident in the 2013 all-Ireland final has been raised a number of times.  We have updated our guidelines since then and as a specific part of that, we went to the GAA's central council, its supreme governing body, which approved and reiterated this approach.  This has been communicated to all team managers and in this year's championship, I recall a game involving a Derry player in which the required action did take place.  Consequently, I believe we have learned from the aforementioned incident and have updated our guidelines accordingly.<br\/>The issue of independent doctors was raised and we believe that because our doctors do their work <i>pro bono<\/i>and because we are an amateur association, they effectively are independent and have demonstrated this over a long period.  There was a question on the mandatory reporting of injuries.  Since we established our injury database in 2007, we have found that voluntary compliance with that from more than 20 teams each year is the best approach, because we work directly with the medical people.  That gives us an excellent database for research from which we identify a number of programmes for both injury treatment and injury prevention.  We have had a number of success in that area, one in particular being the whole area of anterior cruciate ligament, ACL, injuries or cruciate injuries as they are more commonly known.  This is an approach whereby one gets together a good research database after which one can then take actions on foot of that.  As to whether this is something that can be combined from all sports is a matter I will leave to members to decide but we certainly would be willing to co-operate with some sort of database in that regard.  We recommend the education route, rather than legislation at this point.  Compulsion through legislation is not necessary at present and I believe we could work on education.  As for first-aid training, we certainly would support any initiatives in this respect but as an organisation, we encourage it and there is appropriate first-aid training at every club in the country.<br\/>Finally, there was a question on the task force that we recommended and we have met representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills and Health on this matter.  It actually was initiated by the Department of Education and Skills but we suggest it should be driven through the Department of Health.  We consider it to be a matter of public health and we recommend consideration of the programmes in Canada.  As for prioritisation, we suggest that awareness and prevention should be the focus of any initial campaign.  In addition, there is no formal policy in respect of call-out procedures but every club in the country has trained first-aid personnel, maintains a list of local emergency services and has easy access to it.  At any significant games, even at club level, there are trained personnel, who again are volunteers, from the Order of Malta and such like.  In addition, there also will be ambulances present.  Consequently, I believe there is a high awareness of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900011#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>As for the rule change for Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, I am aware it takes a motion at congress or a county convention to get change.

I will take up on three key areas, the first of which is the concussion substitute.  There is an awareness within the association of the medical resources.  In many of the under age and club games, no doctor is on site.  Consequently, the GAA has tried to have the same uniform message for both elite and club players.  As we have been coming from a low base since 2007, it is very much based on education, whereby if one recognises a sign or symptom of concussion, the message is \"if in doubt, take them out\".  As for players getting the best medical attention and safe return to play, the key consideration has been discussed but in considering the guidance of players, we did not want a situation in which they may be left in a vulnerable position whereby they remain on the field and sustain a second injury, hence the issue of the second impact.<\/p><p>  In respect of specialists and with my general practitioner and sports physician hat on, I agree there is a general lack of neurologists and further to that, there is a lack of neurologists with an interest in sports concussion.  As a team doctor and a GP, I am very much reliant on favours, personal connections and using the private health sector to get the opinion for players, particularly for those who have sustained their second and third concussion or, as we have highlighted, the concussion with modifiers.  Each concussion is unique, a lot of concussions are not the same and for a lot of them, particularly for the second or third concussion, one will need specialist opinion.  This is an area of public health to which we must give consideration.  If we are to bring into place concussion policies, we will need those specialists to be in place in order to not leave players in limbo.<\/p><p>  The third area on which I will focus is the SCAT 3 tool.  All health care professionals, including doctors and physios, have been aware of the tool, the first medical part of which is recognition of the injury and a medical examination, namely, the Glasgow coma scale, as well as making sure there are no other injuries.  The second part for doctors is a tool to assess symptoms, to outline return to play and to allow players to be serially monitored.  I believe all players, coaches and schools should have access to the pocket concussion recognition tool, which is a more miniature version of it that is easily readable.  It will give players, coaches and managers the tools to detect it and to be confident in this regard.  It highlights that the key message is, \"if in doubt, sit them out and get medical attention\".  That is where the SCAT 3 is a useful tool but it remains a clinical diagnosis for team doctors like me and it can be difficult.  At times during the game, we do not have the benefit of video analysis or what spectators and television audiences would have.  It is a clinical diagnosis and we have emphasised very much today our role in respect of education of the playing population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900011#L01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sean Moffatt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412848800,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Many of the questions relate to the amateur game and I will leave those to Dr. McLoughlin.  I would like to clear up one misunderstanding regarding the question around with whom the ultimate decision lies.  The simple answer is with the team doctor.  The GAA and rugby are the very much same in this regard.<\/p><p>  Issues were raised around coaches and management.  When I refer to management, I refer to team management and administration, not medical management.  Coaches and management should not be involved because they should not have influence over the decision.  With more money coming into the game in countries such as France and owners coming in with their money, we need to ensure they are separated from medical decisions.  Coaches who want their star player for a particular game or in subsequent weeks should be separated 100% from that decision.  There should not be any pressure, therefore, from coaches or management.  It may have existed in the past but it should not exist in this day and age.  With regard to subsequent weeks, we have the gradual return to play policy in rugby.  The coach should be separated from getting into a medic's ear or a player's ear to say, \"You're okay, mate\".  <\/p><p>  I refer to the issue raised around referees.  The team doctor and not the referee is the final decision maker.  However, the referee is often in a better position.  I reiterate my colleague's words: \"If in doubt, recognise and remove any doubt\" or \"If in doubt, sit out\".  The referee might often recognise that doubt having seen the collision and, therefore, he should advise the team doctor but, ultimately, the doctor will always be the final decision maker in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900012#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Omar Hassanien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412848800,"counter":876,"content":"<p>We see that the referee is the person with the authority.  We say to our referees that even if there is a consultant neurosurgeon on the sideline, if they doubt that somebody is fit to play or suspect they have a concussion, they should be off.  We do not want clinical discussions on a sideline.  The other important thing we are doing is that we are saying it is the responsibility of all.  We are educating players that if the player inside them is concussed, they have a responsibility for their safety because, as has been clearly shown during this meeting, no one can see everything and we need to keep this in mind.  People also need to understand that we are educating them for their health, not for our health.  That is a culture change, which takes time.<br\/>The association between concussion and CTE was mentioned.  I cannot tell the committee the association.  A recent article in the <i>British Journal of Sports Medicine<\/i>refers to 158 cases worldwide.  All we seem to know is that traumatic injury to the head may have a connection with CTE.  We do not know that yet and, therefore, what we need to do to mitigate that is manage concussions well now in order that people do not suffer repetitive concussions.<br\/>Training was another issue raised.  All our trainers are pre-hospital care trained.  We give standard medical approach training to all our people.  It is not that they are getting different training.  This is what doctors have been trained in; it is pre-hospital level training.<br\/>The IRFU has a clear policy on supplements.  No supplements should be taken by under 18s.  If somebody has evidence to suggest that policy has been broken, they should tell us.<br\/>I refer to the issue of whether legislation is needed.  Zurich talks about medical clearance.  I would look for clarity and help on this.  My understanding is medical clearance can only be given by a doctor whereas in America allied health care professionals who have been specifically trained in concussion management and assessment are used.  That may be worth looking at.  Do we have the ability to use trained physiotherapists or others similar to practice nurses who have expertise in a particular area?<br\/>The pocket SCAT is included in our handout.  Let me be clear that I do not want people to become doctors.  If this helps make the diagnosis, that is fine, but, as has been reiterated, if someone has any doubt, he or she should not even take out the pocket SCAT and just take the player off.One of the kick backs we get is fear on the part of referees about taking responsibility for a decision they may get wrong and where they stand legally.  We would prefer if they put off lots of non-concussed players rather than the other way around.<br\/>I estimate 97% of the time I spend managing concussion, which is two to three days a week in terms of policy setting and overseeing it, relates to the amateur game.  One of the cases mentioned was a result of failure to follow the guidelines.  Everyone mentions education and I will not argue with that but implementation studies tell us that for education to be effective, it has to be proactive, user specific, instance specific and impact orientated.  For example, we have a six minute video that all our referees must watch.  It specifically tells them what they have to do on the pitch and in handover with specific sentences of guidance.  It is specific to referees, specific to an incident and it impacts outcome because we are telling them what to do.  It is the same with our coaching and, therefore, we are moving on from education to looking at how education has a greater impact.  We are also beginning to look at whether we are having an impact.  We will come back and tell the committee because we do not know.<br\/>We give guidance to all clubs on the terms of basic first aid content and so on and we have taken our safe rugby programme nationwide.  That is getting down and into the clubs.  We are very much trying to drive this within clubs.  Two weeks ago we gave a talk to 60 schools coaches because we have proactively gone after people.  We rang and e-mailed schools to get names.  We are going out there because one can produce the material but it can sit there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900012#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rod McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848800,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I would like to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of Mr. Stephen McNamara, IRFU director of communications; Mr. Feargal Carruth, chief executive officer of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association; Mr. Feargal Mac Giolla, Ceannaire Riarch&aacute;in na gCluich&iacute;-Imreoir&iacute;, GAA ceannaire; Ms Karen O&rsquo;Boyle, communications manager, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland; and Mr. Damian McDonald, chief executive officer, Horse Sport Ireland.<\/p><p>  I thank our witnesses for attending and for their expertise and time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900012#M00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848800,"counter":878,"content":"<p>It was great for promoting sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900012#M00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I thank them for the quality for their replies, which were helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900012#M00500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1412848800,"counter":880,"content":"<p>Our committee is not adversarial.

I am joined today by Dr. Miriam Owens, specialist in public health medicine, and Mr. Ronan Toomey, assistant principal officer, both of whom are working on the implementation of the Healthy Ireland project, which I will outline in a few moments.<\/p><p>  First, I take the opportunity to commend you, Chairman, and your committee for raising the profile of this important issue which I have no doubt will make an important contribution to the awareness raising that must happen in relation to concussion.  We have all seen some very public examples of concussion at major sporting events recently.  We are also very aware that it is not just at major sporting events that the dangers of concussion arise.  We know that there is always a risk of injury in every aspect of daily living.  Normal day-to-day activities, whether in the school, while commuting, at home or in the workplace can result in injury.  An injury such as concussion, wherever it occurs, presents particular challenges which we recognise need greater attention.  Wherever incidents occur, during sport or otherwise, the Department of Health recognises that more can be done to respond in a manner that ensures the safety and health of the person experiencing concussion.<\/p><p>  I understand that a number of medical experts presented considerable detail on concussion to the committee at last week&rsquo;s hearing so I will not repeat it again but it is appropriate to recall a few particularly important points.  First, it is important that we describe concussion as what it is in order to convince everybody of the severity of the problem.  Concussion is mild traumatic brain injury.  If those with responsibility for responding to incidents are convinced of this very real trauma to the brain, I think they will be more likely to respond in an appropriate manner.  The symptoms of concussion may not be immediately apparent but may evolve over a longer period of time and it is important that somebody who may have experienced an incident is monitored to see how they are affected.<\/p><p>  Concussion is not specific to any one activity and can occur anywhere.  The management of concussion includes evaluation, removal from active participation, medical assessment of symptoms, and physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve, followed by a gradual return to participation.  The second important point to stress is that the risk of further complications is increased if an initial concussion is not properly diagnosed and treated.  Members of the committee will be aware of Healthy Ireland, the framework approved by Government for improved health and well-being.  The framework provides for new arrangements to promote effective co-operation between various sectors involved in protecting, promoting and improving the health and well-being of the population.  The requirement to work together across sectors and across society is at the heart of what Healthy Ireland is about.<\/p><p>  If the issues that influence the health and well-being of people are left to be dealt with by the health sector alone, we will fail to deal with them as we should and we will limit not only the health and well-being of our people, but also their ability to play a full and active part in the economy and in society at large.  Healthy Ireland aims to provide a strong focus for modifying unhealthy lifestyle habits and, in particular, promoting awareness of the benefits of physical activity.  These benefits are seen not just in physical and mental health, but also through participation and community involvement.<\/p><p>  One of the priority actions under way is the development of a national physical activity plan, which will encourage greater levels of participation in physical activity.  Mr. Ronan Toomey, who is present, co-chairs a group tasked with developing the plan with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is a novel way of approaching something in which we have a shared interest and it is a very good piece of work which we look forward to being finalised in the near future.  We all want more people to participate in sport and physical activity, but we want to encourage that in a way that keeps people safe and healthy and provides appropriate responses when an injury such as suspected concussion occurs.  We must also ensure that we do not discourage anybody from participating in sport either directly or as a volunteer because of fears about sustaining injury or concerns about how to respond when in a position of authority or responsibility.<\/p><p>  The health and well-being programme in the Department of Health, together with the Department of Education and Skills, recently began to explore the issue of concussion in school settings.  The two Departments brought together a small group of relevant experts from key organisations to have an exploratory discussion about the implications of concussion and to identify current shortcomings in concussion awareness.  Many of the experts have already contributed to the deliberations of the committee.  A number of issues have been identified, many of which were also discussed by the committee last week - there is a need for a change of culture, particularly among coaches, players, officials and all others attending matches to remove a player suspected of having concussion from the field of play immediately and if concussion is suspected, a player should not be allowed to return to play until he or she has been properly assessed and medically cleared to return.<\/p><p>  There is a lack of data on the incidence of concussion in this country.  The need for cognitive rest is not fully appreciated and implemented.  That has considerable implications for learning and engagement in school settings.  There is a need for greater education and training of emergency medical personnel and general practitioners on the assessment and management of concussion.  Without that, there is a danger of concerned parents and others being unable to access appropriate medical assessment and evaluation of possible concussion.  It is vitally important that there is also education and awareness training for coaches, parents, teachers and all others involved in sport.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work of a number of sporting organisations, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and the faculty of sports and exercise medicine which have been very proactive in this area and have developed guidance on concussion, as they outlined to the committee, for participants, coaches, officials and others.  The Department of Health believes there is an opportunity to build on this work and develop a uniform approach to understanding and educating people about concussion and creating a better awareness about injury prevention, risk reduction and response and treatment for concussion.  While concussion is a complex issue, initially we intend to work with the Department of Education and Science and the group of experts from the key organisations to which I referred earlier, to raise awareness of the implications and responses necessary when dealing with suspected cases of concussion.  We want to reflect best international practice, which is well set out, to ensure physical activities and sport can be undertaken in the knowledge that if an injury occurs it will be dealt with in a safe manner.<\/p><p>  One way to progress the matter is the development and distribution of common information materials to reiterate that the management of concussion includes the elements I outlined.  We hope the material will be widely distributed to everybody with responsibility for providing sports and physical activity opportunities.  In our deliberations on concussion, we have recognised that we need to explore further what more needs to be done to ensure concussion is addressed in a safe manner.  It is clear that the national governing bodies have a very important role in demonstrating an appropriate and adequate response to concussion when it occurs in public view.  It is important for children and others involved in sport to see that what happens on television is in compliance with good practice and does not provide poor or bad example for them.  It is through a greater public visibility of such actions that everyone can be aware and appreciate the dangers and consequences of concussion.  Many instances of concussion are happening at events away from the public limelight and without medical or paramedical attention available.  That clearly demonstrates a need for greater awareness among match officials, coaches, teachers, parents and players when concussion happens at minor events and in recreational settings and also the need for those routinely involved in such settings to have adequate training in the early management of injury.<\/p><p>  While many organisations have developed excellent guidance materials for their individual sports - the committee has been made aware of them - there is an acceptance that there is not widespread adherence to guidelines.  While in no way criticising the excellent progress made by a large number of organisations in recent years, a singular process will be beneficial in encouraging everyone to understand the true importance and implications of concussion, which as I outlined is a mild traumatic brain injury.  Medical practitioners have the same duty of care when dealing with sporting or other injuries as they do in a formal clinical setting.  That is important in terms of the visibility of events portrayed on television.  In saying that, I also recognise that no medical or paramedical expertise will be present at the vast majority of occasions where people are participating in sporting and other recreational activities that take place every day of the week.<\/p><p>  My colleagues in the Department will continue to liaise with the relevant experts to identify what we can do to develop a more effective and uniform approach to understanding and educating people about concussion through the singular mechanism we advocate and on which preparatory work has begun.  I acknowledge the ongoing interest demonstrated in this issue and the evidence presented to the committee last week which clearly signifies the value and potential of the initiative on which we are about to embark.  I would be happy to return in the future to provide an update to the committee if members so wish.  I again acknowledge the commitment to this important public health issue shown by the committee and particularly by you, Chairman, in conducting these hearings.<\/p> <p>I welcome the inclusion of player representatives at these committee hearings, as their experiences provide a valuable perspective.  We look forward to the conclusions of the committee and to the continued ongoing engagement with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412850300,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I invite Dr. Tony Gaynor of the Department of Education and Skills to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900015#Q00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412850300,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for giving me an opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the issue of concussion in sport from the perspective of the Department of Education and Skills.  I work in the Department's curriculum and assessment policy unit.  I am accompanied by Mr. Se&aacute;nie McGrath, who is a post-primary subject inspector for physical education.<\/p><p>  The Department recognises the seriousness of concussion and its potential impact on an individual's well-being.  It is aware that concussion can happen to anyone, at any stage of life and at any time.  It is not the case that it only happens during school time or on school premises, or that it only arises in the context of sports or other physical activities.  The Department's focus is on ensuring school authorities are equipped with the appropriate knowledge and skills to enable them to promote pupil safety during school time or during the many extra-curricular activities that are supported by schools.  We assure the joint committee of our willingness, in conjunction with other relevant stakeholders such as the Department of Health, to take any measures necessary to further promote pupil safety.<\/p><p>  Each board of management of a school, or the relevant education and training board in the case of such schools, is responsible as an employer for ensuring as far as reasonably practicable the safety and health at work of its employees, pupils and anyone else on school premises.  In particular, each school is required under section 20 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to have a school safety statement.  These statements are intended to ensure each board of management has the appropriate procedures in place to safeguard safety and health at school level.  These include procedures in relation to first aid, accidents and dangerous occurrences and instruction, training and supervision.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills and the Health and Safety Authority have co-operated to produce guidance to assist the boards of management of primary and post-primary schools in developing their safety statements.  One of the key steps in this process is an assessment of the potential risks to safety and health within schools.  When these risks have been identified and assessed, boards of management are expected to reflect in their safety statements the means by which such risks will be eliminated or prevented as far as possible.  Safety statements should be regularly reviewed by boards of management to ensure they address any new risks identified at school level.  We believe the structures in place at school level, through the safety statement process, are sufficiently flexible to allow schools to respond positively to any new pupil safety and health challenges they are made aware of.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills is actively contributing to the Healthy Ireland agenda, which is being led by the Department of Health.  To this end, we support a number of programmes and initiatives to promote physical activity and contribute to tackling the growing problem of obesity.  As well as the physical education programme in primary and post-primary schools, the Department of Education and Skills also promotes the active school flag and active schools week, as well as a number of innovative pilot initiatives such as the Points for Life project, which focuses on improving the physical literacy of pupils.  We are also centrally involved in the development of the national physical activity plan, which has been mentioned and is being led by the Departments of Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>  The latest data, which were collated from schools through a life skills survey published by the Department of Education and Skills in January 2014, indicate that schools are very active in supporting extra-curricular activities among their students.  These data indicate that 81% of primary and 96% of post-primary schools promote physical activities outside the school day.  This encompasses a range of pursuits, including Gaelic games, soccer, rugby, athletics, swimming, hockey and horse riding.  According to the same survey, 98% of primary and 86% of post-primary schools that responded to the survey promote physical activity during break-times.  It is clear, therefore, that schools are playing an important role in the overall Healthy Ireland agenda.  As we develop guidance for schools on the topic of concussion, the Departments of Education and Skills and Health are conscious of the need to ensure such guidance does not discourage schools from continuing to promote physical activity among their students.<\/p><p>  The Department views the issue of concussion in sport or otherwise very seriously.  The potential dangers are clearly illustrated by the tragic case of Benjamin Robinson.  Following an initial approach to the Department from Benjamin&rsquo;s father, Peter, officials spoke with him via teleconference in January 2014.  Mr. Robinson outlined the progress being made at that time in raising awareness of concussion-related injuries in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Following that meeting, the information provided by Mr. Robinson was circulated by the Department of Education and Skills to the Physical Education Association of Ireland and the well-being team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers.  Such information will enhance the ability of physical education teachers to deal with suspected incidences of concussion.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills made contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Education.  The Northern Ireland officials agreed to share the work they were undertaking in this area, which subsequently formed the basis of the \"Recognise and Remove\" leaflet that was circulated to all school boards and other relevant bodies in Northern Ireland in May 2014.  Mr. Peter Robinson's concerns were also raised by Mr. Se&aacute;nie McGrath with the members of the national physical activity plan at a working group meeting on 12 February 2014.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health made it clear at that time that it was concerned about this issue and was interested in promoting awareness of the signs and symptoms of concussion.  Both Departments agreed to ascertain whether organisations providing information on concussion were interested in collaborating on an awareness raising campaign for schools.  Such organisations include a number of major sporting bodies - many of them, including the IRFU, the GAA and the Turf Club, were mentioned earlier - and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland.  Contact was made with the medical representatives of each of these organisations and a meeting was arranged in the Department of Health in July 2014.  This meeting was attended by representatives of Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, the IRFU, the GAA, the FAI, the Turf Club and both Departments.<\/p><p>  There was broad consensus among those present at the meeting about the seriousness of the issue of concussion.  It was agreed to draft a concussion awareness leaflet for discussion among the group, with clear and concise messages to support everyone providing and participating in sport or physical activity in schools and elsewhere.  There was broad agreement on the type of issues that would need to be covered in such a leaflet, including material on the sports concussion assessment tool, links to the resources produced by various sports national governing bodies and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and references to the consensus statement on concussion in sport that was produced at Zurich in November 2012.  While there is broad agreement on the main principles that should inform the leaflet for schools, some additional work is necessary.  As this is primarily a medical rather than a pedagogical issue, we would defer to the expertise of the relevant health experts in the Department of Health, the national sports governing bodies and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland in drawing up the final content of the leaflet.  We will be more than happy to advise on any education-related issues that arise in the course of drafting the leaflet.  We envisage our primary role to be to circulate the guidance to schools as part of a communications strategy.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by assuring the joint committee of our willingness to raise awareness of this important issue in schools.  We will continue to co-operate with the Department of Health and other relevant health experts to ensure appropriate advice issues to schools.  I would be happy to respond to any questions the members of the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900015#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Gaynor"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850300,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I thank all of those who have made presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900015#Q00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850300,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I welcome all of those present and thank them for their presentations.  We have learnt a great deal about sport-related concussions since last week.  It is obvious that we need to introduce clear protocols and to adhere to best practice.  I would like to pick up on one or two points that were made in the presentations.  Dr. Holohan said, \"we want to reflect best international practice... to ensure physical activities and sport can be undertaken in the knowledge that if an injury occurs it will be dealt with in a safe manner\".  What is international best practice?  What model or country should we be following in that regard?  We were told that broad agreement was reached at the meetings that took place about an awareness raising campaign for schools.  When will this be ready to circulate?<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to a few of the issues that have been discussed over recent sessions.  Who should be responsible for ensuring a player is forced to leave the field on foot of a concussion or suspected concussion?  Given that medical personnel will not be present at all amateur and juvenile games played across the country, should the referee, the linesman, the coach or a parent have to do this?  Should a person with first aid skills always be present before a match is allowed to start?  Should all officials be trained in first aid?  I was surprised to hear we have no national database to collate information.  What do we need to do in that regard?  The lack of proper concussion clinics is another issue that came up in the course of our discussions.  How do we rectify this?  We do not have an international centre of excellence.  There is a lack of neurosurgeons.  How can we change things so that we have the neurosurgeons we need?<\/p> <p>Regarding education, who should be responsible for rolling out awareness campaigns?  We have heard about a campaign that the Department of Education and Skills intends to roll out, but is the Department of Health planning to roll out a campaign?  Are the sporting bodies going to initiate campaigns?  Who should be responsible for this?  <\/p><p> Many of the other questions I intended to pose have been asked and answered already so I will leave it at that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900015#Q00500","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412850900,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Apologies have been received from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.

I apologise for not being here earlier, but there was a vote in the Seanad and a number of other committee meetings were taking place this morning.  At the last session, the GAA raised the issue of a task force.  I understand it has been in correspondence with the Department of Health on the subject.  Is the Department of Health going to give serious consideration to establishing a task force which would have representatives of various sporting organisations and sports medicine bodies as well as primary and post-primary schools?  Such a task force could devise a programme for dealing with the general issue of sports injury.  Can we proceed with establishing such a task force, as called for by the GAA, and could the witnesses outline the timescale for its establishment?  What is the thinking within the Department on this?<\/p><p>  The next issue I wish to raise relates to primary schools, particularly those in urban areas.  Where I work, on the north side of Cork city, one of the schools had more than 400 students but no indoor sports facilities, which was problematic given the Irish climate.  The school fought for over 15 years before it got an indoor facility that could accommodate the students for physical education.  Has the Department of Education and Skills carried out an audit of primary schools, particularly in urban areas, in terms of indoor sports facilities?  In fairness to the Department, I know it must prioritise areas in which there are no schools at all or where there is a sudden increase in demand for primary school places.  That said, perhaps it could roll out a five to ten year programme to provide or improve indoor sports facilities in primary schools.  Has an audit been done to identify where the deficiencies are at present?  What information is available in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900016#R00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850900,"counter":894,"content":"<p>A point was made in the previous session about equestrian and boxing organisations having a lot of strict rules and protocols.

In terms of where we look to for examples of best practice, we are talking about countries as well as individual sporting organisations.  Some sporting organisations, at both a national and international level, are better than others.  There are particularly good examples of best practice in rugby in South Africa.  In terms of public health initiatives on the wider issue of concussion in sport, Canada is an example of best practice.  We are looking at all of those examples and have material on them to build into what we are trying to do here.<br\/>We are at the initial stages of our engagement with the sporting bodies.  We would like to be in a situation in which we have a singular message.  We are all agreed on the science behind the message but we must reach agreement on how it looks and feels and how to promote it.  The Department of Education and Skills will be assisting us in the promulgation of the message to the school setting, which is very important because the question of children returning safely to learning is a big part of the management of concussion.  We still have some work to do in this area.  While a lot of good work has been done by individual sporting bodies, we are some way away from the point at which we have agreement on a singular mechanism and are actually putting it in place.  It would be hard for me, therefore, to predict how quickly it will be done.  There is no lack of willingness on our part or on the part of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage, and that is also the case with the sporting bodies themselves.<br\/>Deputy McLellan also asked who is responsible for the player leaving the field.  That is a complicated question and I will offer her my personal view, rather than a departmental one.  I am very involved in coaching myself, and when one gets down to a certain level it is difficult because the level of official engagement varies in the sports in which large numbers of young children participate.  There are generally referees for games - in GAA, for example, there are Go Games referees, but they are only trained to a certain level.  One of the big challenges for all sporting organisations is to get the volunteers and mentors trained to a sufficient level so that they understand their obligations as trainers.  Issues such as child protection come into the equation here.  There must also be a singular view among parents, which can be challenging.  We believe that having a singular communication mechanism, a tool or a leaflet, that has the same look and feel whether it comes through the school or through the GAA clubs, boxing clubs, rugby clubs and so forth, will help in terms of consistency and implementing the message.  <br\/>In terms of training requirements, the coaching courses that most of the major sporting bodies run have content on concussion.  However, getting people to participate in those courses is challenging and we must recognise that fact.  It would be very easy for us to sit in criticism of the sporting organisations, but we know they are doing their best to overcome the difficulties involved in getting the message out to very large numbers of people.<br\/>We do not want to introduce any artificial requirement that might raise the standard from a participation point of view only to see people dropping out.  We must remember that it is predominantly volunteers who get children out onto the playing fields at weekends and so forth.  Were they to drop out, even in small numbers, that would have a profound impact on the number of children participating in sport.  Indeed, if we reflect on the wider issue of children's participation in sport, that is something we as a Department are concerned about.  We are particularly concerned about the level of participation in sport by girls in their teenage years and about their access to sporting and physical activity opportunities.  We do not want to do anything that will interfere with that.  We must promote awareness and so on while preserving a lot of what is already in place that is good.  We do not want the volunteers to drop out either, because there is considerable evidence that volunteering yields significant physical, emotional and mental health benefits, irrespective of the actual activity.  <br\/>Reference was made to a concussion database, but one of the challenges is that a lot of concussed individuals never formally present to our health services, so capturing the data is difficult.  We have national data on those presenting and being admitted to hospital following concussion, but that is not representative of the total body of people who are being concussed.  My information is that most of the good information available in places such as the US is generated through special surveys as opposed to routine reporting systems, which would be very difficult to put in place to capture a full picture on concussion.  <br\/>Concussion clinics were referred to earlier and neurosurgery was also mentioned, both of which are important.  However, concussion <i>per se<\/i>is not something we will deal with effectively through the provision of neurosurgical services.  That is not where the gap lies.<\/p> <p>Again, I am not suggesting that the Deputy is saying that.  Neurosurgery is required for people who have significant brain trauma as a consequence of whatever mechanism.  We must promote awareness among first responders who are going to be dealing with the vast majority of people, particularly children, who are concussed.  They must understand what they have to do.  The provision of extra neurosurgeons, with all due respect to them, will not help us significantly in terms of dealing with the public health impact of concussion.<\/p><p> Senator Burke asked about the task force.  I understand the suggestion was made by the GAA and I had a very quick chat with Mr. Pat Ryan, the chairman of the player welfare committee, whom we know and work with.  This is something that is very resonant with the kind of idea we already have going.  There is a meeting of minds there.  We are already involved in an exercise and can look to how we might structure it in a way that addresses the specific GAA suggestion.  Our door is completely open in terms of working with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and with sporting bodies to address these issues and we would be very happy to look at what the GAA is proposing.  The idea we have already outlined to the committee this morning - the work we have put in train with the Department of Education and Skills with regard to its initiative - to develop a common information tool is an expression of our commitment to the way of working that the GAA was calling for this morning.<\/p><p> There was a question on the medical record book in other sports.  I cannot provide the committee with an informed answer to that.  It seems to me that many sports have a great deal to teach other sports.  There appears to be an increasing awareness or understanding of the value of the cross-fertilisation of ideas between sporting bodies.  Outside this arena, we see the use of yellow and red cards.  Some sporting organisations have demonstrated an ability to learn from others.  While there will be questions around the practicality of some of those things when one gets into the very large numbers of people, particularly children, in certain large-scale sports, we will do anything we can to facilitate and encourage cross-fertilisation of learning in the approaches to dealing with concussion and the implementation of the standard guidelines.<\/p><p> I hope I have not left any question out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900016#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412851500,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I am sorry to come back on the task force issue, but in fairness, witnesses came in this morning with a very structured set of recommendations.  One of the important things about meetings and public hearings such as this is to ensure we get something out of them and follow through.  I accept fully that a great deal of work has been done by both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health on this area.  However, a complaint I have about a different area in the Department of Health involves nursing homes and home care, where there has been a failure to get everyone to sit around the table at the same time.  It is fine to have the GAA come in and meet the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills, but they are doing so on a one-to-one basis.  By getting everyone around the table, which is the advantage of a task force, everyone's view is out there at the same time and it is possible to come forward with a far more comprehensive solution.  I wonder if their proposals and recommendations will be given serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900017#S00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412851500,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I can provide the Senator with complete assurance on that.

I am quite happy to reflect on the matter, advise the Minister and have him make a decision.  I am sure he will be willing to update Senator Burke on that at a future point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900017#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412851500,"counter":899,"content":"<p>A few of the questions were directly for the Department of Education and Skills.  In terms of the timing of the report, the findings and discussion by the joint committee have been very useful in informing our thinking, identifying issues and filling in the gaps.  To echo Dr. Holohan, we are very committed to concluding a process which we have started already.  We are also of the view that what we want out of this is a single resource.  We do not want duplication of resources out there, as it would lead to confusion among relevant stakeholders.  We want one common resource that can be used in any setting, although it might have to be tailored to specific instances.  That can be covered in the common resource, but what we do not want is a different resource for each sector.  We want the schools sector and the education sector to fold into the overall resource so that the final guidance developed by the Department of Health with co-operation from ourselves and the sports bodies will be applicable to schools as well.  Our role will be to disseminate that across the education sector and to schools.  We do not want to be involved in drafting a specific resource for schools, however.  A common resource that crosses sectors is important and that is what we support.<\/p><p>  Concussion is a society-wide issue and schools have an important role to play in that regard.  However, we do not want schools to be seen as a panacea for all of society's ills.  Children spend a limited amount of time in school in comparison to out-of-school time.  Parents have a huge role to play, and the information campaign that is launched and of which schools will be a part should be targeting parents and coaches, among other groups.  We have heard from the joint committee's proceedings over previous days of the importance of education for GPs and other medical practitioners also.  These are all sectors of society that must be informed and subject to awareness-raising.  One member of the joint committee indicated that she had had a fall in the bathroom and learned about the dangers of concussion the hard way, and that there is sometimes a time lag before symptoms manifest themselves.  We see it, therefore, as a society-wide issue.  We are committed to and supportive of playing a role in relation to schools, but will row in behind the overall expertise of the health experts.<\/p><p>  The question of first aid was raised.  In the safety statement schools must produce as part of their assessments of risk, one of the matters that must be taken into consideration is the extent to which first aid exists within a school.  If there are gaps, or if inadequate numbers of staff have received training, those will be identified in school training plans.  We leave it to boards of management of schools and to whomever responsibility for safety has been delegated within a school to make the call.  Boards of management are autonomous in terms of how they govern the schools and we leave the decision as to how many people are trained in first aid to them.  That is most appropriate.<\/p><p>  Senator Burke asked about sports facilities.  As new schools are built, sports facilities are provided.  The Senator is right that we have a huge capital budget that is spent on building schools, and within that the priority is on new school placements, which has to be the case.  However, it is open to schools to apply for funding.  If there are schools in urban areas which have deficiencies in relation to sports halls, they can apply to be considered as part of the capital programme.  Within the application process there is prioritisation across different sectors, so such applications will be considered.  While the Department must make a call on priorities, it is open to schools to apply and be considered for capital funding for sports halls.  Applications will be considered in due process as part of the overall capital budget available to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900017#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Gaynor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1412851500,"counter":900,"content":"<p>It is worth putting in context some of the work that is ongoing in the Department on physical activity, which will add to what Dr. Holohan and Dr. Gaynor have said.  As Dr. Holohan mentioned, we are in the process of developing a national physical activity plan and are engaging to a significant extent with a range of stakeholders to identify the best means by which we can get the population of the country more active.  While these stakeholders include the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, the sporting bodies, the Irish Sports Council and a range of other stakeholders are key to the implementation of what is a significant challenge for us.  Our primary message is that physical activity is one of the most significant decisions anyone can make that benefits their own health.  That message must filter down to everyone.  Of course, we must do that in a way that ensures the safety and security of any individual who chooses to participate in physical activity.<\/p><p>  The ongoing discussions we have had with the sporting bodies on developing a physical activity plan show that they are fully committed to working with us.  As Dr. Holohan mentioned earlier, one of the innovative aspects of Healthy Ireland is that it calls for genuine cross-sectoral engagement.  That is not just with the Department of Education and Skills, with which we have had a very good relationship on the delivery of the plan, but also the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is co-chairing the group.<\/p> <p>That is also the case outside our own areas of responsibility in the sports bodies and working with community and voluntary organisations to try to identify the best means of doing it.<\/p><p> I will make one further point about what Dr. Gaynor said about facilities in schools.  One of the engagements we have had with sports bodies is attempting to identify how best to use the facilities available in communities across the country.  Many sports facilities are available for particular single organisations, for example, football, soccer, rugby and athletics clubs and so on.  There might be an opportunity to better share these facilities at local level and we have been trying to identify how we can encourage this and ensure the sharing of facilities becomes a priority agenda in local communities throughout the country.  I hope it will add to the ongoing work the Department is undertaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014100900017#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Toomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412852100,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Toomey.  <\/p><p>  I want to make one or two comments in response to Dr. Gaynor.  I could not agree with her more that children do not live in schools; they live in communities.  Therefore, we all have a responsibility in that regard.<\/p><p>  Mr. Toomey spoke about getting all stakeholders involved.  I wish him luck in trying to have facilities shared, as it can be difficult to achieve.  I know that at local level we try to submit a municipal application for sports capital grants, but people want to make their own applications.  However, Mr. Toomey is right.  There are examples up and down the country of schools, in particular, opening their facilities in the evening which is hugely beneficial to communities.<\/p><p>  I am very involved in ladies football and since last weekend the very proud mother of a county champion, but ladies football and ladies' sport in general are often forgotten.  We talk about the GAA, but the GAA is not the Ladies Gaelic Football Association.  We use the GAA as an umbrella brand, but it only deals with men.  We have to remember the Camogie Association and the Women's Football Association.<\/p><p>  On how to deal with cases of concussion, we had a scary incident in a semi-final some weeks ago in which a young girl was concussed and there was not even a bottle of holy water available.  There is an onus on clubs which are struggling, particularly in women's sport, to raise money because they do not capture the same generosity from communities as men's football to provide first aid facilities, training and so on.  If we are serious about women participating in sport, we have to make sure they are resourced.  <\/p><p>  I thank everybody for his or her informative and challenging presentation.  This was our fourth meeting focusing on these important and challenging issues.  The delegates' submissions will be important to us as we continue our deliberations and prepare a report for the Minister for Health.
