We have six speakers remaining and I acknowledge the position on the Government side.  The proposal is sensible in that it will give everyone who wants to speak an opportunity to do so.  That is important.<\/p><p>On Tuesday, I tabled an amendment to the Order of Business on the new Central Bank statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears that the Government brought forward and approved.  The Leader suggested to me on that morning that I raise my concerns directly with the Minister for Finance under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.  I took him up on his advice and endeavoured to elicit as many answers to the questions as I could from the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, on the day.  None was answered because, as I mentioned to the Leader, they were not relevant to that Bill.  The Minister of State was not required to answer the questions that I asked.<\/p> <p>To remind the House, I specifically asked why the Government was removing the 12 month moratorium and would now be allowing banks after three months to issue legal proceedings to repossess homes.  I also asked why the Government was removing the maximum number of contacts someone in mortgage arrears could have with a bank from three a month to any number the bank wanted such that if at any time the bank wanted to ring the person concerned, knock at his or her door, call to him or her, hassle and harangue him or her, that was what the code of conduct on mortgage arrears meant it could do.  <\/p><p>Ulster Bank completely misled the public in its statement earlier in the week that 35% of those in mortgage arrears were strategic defaulters.  That is absolute rubbish and, frankly, a lie.  I ask Ulster Bank to produce the figures that apparently prove one third of those in mortgage arrears with the bank are strategic defaulters.  It is total nonsense.<\/p><p>Banks talk about co-operating and non-co-operating borrowers.  I asked the Leader on Tuesday what was the Government's definition of a co-operating or non-co-operating bank and why, in God's name, had the Government and the Central Bank given the banks everything they wanted in this new code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  There is no independent appeals office, which we brought forward by way of legislation, only for the Government to vote it down, although this was recommended by New Beginnings, the Independent Mortgage Advisers Federation and many other independent groups.  It would mean there would be an arbitration process whereby the decision would not be left to the banks, that the banks would be the ones to come forward with what they believed was a sustainable solution, and, if the mortgage holder could not meet this, all bets would be off.<\/p><p>What the Government is proposing in the statutory code of conduct is free gain for banks against those in mortgage arrears.  I remind the House that one in four mortgages is either in arrears for 30 days or more, or has been restructured.  Nearly 50% of restructured mortgages have gone back into arrears.  I do not believe anyone in his or her right mind can stand over the new code of conduct.  <\/p><p>During the course of the debate on the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 I directly asked the Minister of  State, Deputy Brian Hayes, the questions I had put to the Leader on Tuesday and not one answer did I receive.  As a result, I am again proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that we allow one hour for either the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Brian Hayes, to come to the House to answer the questions many of us have regarding how the code of conduct will protect mortgage holders and why the Government allowed the banks to get everything they wanted in it.  I will continue to propose amendments to the Order of Business every single day until we have a specific debate in order that we can all tease out this issue because I know Members on the Government side are just as concerned about it as I am, as has been referred to on the Order of Business and in debates all the way through.  I formally propose that amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372930200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As Senator Darragh O'Brien knows, I share his concerns about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It is ironic that people are having breakfast this morning and reading reports that the European Central Bank is going to leave rates as they are, even though many know they could not survive a rise of two interest points in the ECB rate; that is the situation in this country.  It is a very serious matter and I would go so far as to say it is the most serious matter facing the country.  I share Senator Darragh O'Brien's concern and ask the Leader to have the Minister come to the House at his earliest possible convenience, as I have called for on numerous occasions.  However, I appreciate the position the Leader is in and know that he has made his absolute best efforts to ensure that debate will take place.  Therefore, I would not be in favour of putting him under any more pressure than he is under.  We have to accept that he is doing his absolute best as Leader of the House.<\/p><p>I wish our American brethren a happy Fourth of July and the best on their national holiday.  <\/p><p>I welcome the announcement made yesterday that St. Patrick's Institution was to close, a most welcome development.  Some of the findings by the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, are nothing short of shocking and appalling.  During his visit, after last year's report in which serious concerns were raised, he found a prisoner in a filthy committal cell, with a considerable quantity of stale food on the floor.  There was a broken toilet which was filthy and full of excrement.  He found another prisoner who had been taken from his cell and strip searched, although no records had been created.  In another cell he found two prisoners who were afraid to leave because they had been badly beaten and one had been stabbed three times.<\/p><p>This is both serious and a national disgrace.  On a previous occasion I called for the setting up of a commission of inquiry to examine what had gone on in St. Patrick's Institution over many decades.  Calls for its closure have been made for in excess of 20 years.  It is a national disgrace that, as a country, we wait for people who have suffered at the hands of the State to take individual actions.  We should have a permanent commission of inquiry in areas where the State has provided care, particularly for children.<\/p><p>I will conclude by noting that two out of every three children who leave the care of the State and a greater number of those who have been in the prison service experience homelessness within two years.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in this House committed to having an after-care service for these children.  I ask the Leader to have the Minister in the House as soon as possible to explain what progress has been made in providing after-care services for children who have been in the care of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400003#B00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1372930200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I note that in the <i>Financial Times<\/i> today there is an article by the associate editor, Mr. John Gapper, which states:<blockquote><br \/>This week brought two announcements that strike at the distortions caused to banking by cheap credit and the underpricing of risk over past decades.  One was the US Federal Reserve's decision to implement the Basel III capital rules, and to add extra measures.  The other was the European Commission's assault on how banks trade credit derivatives.<\/blockquote>He concludes: &quot;It was never going to be easy to reform bad banking habits acquired over decades but, several years after the crash, banks are facing the inevitable regulatory reckoning&quot;.  We have to be alert to these developments and, as we had a bigger banking problem than anybody else, more resolute.<\/p><p>  In this House the issue of the tapes was raised.  I commend the Minister for Finance, Michael Deputy Noonan, and Deputy Pearse Doherty for pursuing the issue and hope we can get all of them.  Parliament will have to take on this task, as the Leader commented yesterday.  We did not get a sense of urgency in the legislation we discussed during the week, but I commend both the Minister and Deputy Pearse Doherty for pursuing the issue of the tapes and trying to discover where they have been for the past three years and why they have not been available.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes - or the other Mr. Hayes, as we will have to call him as we now have two Ministers of State with the name Hayes - for the strength of the debate here yesterday and accepting in principle the Food Provenance Bill proposed by Senator Feargal Quinn.

It gave us daft rules on the insuring of women in driving cars and tobacco marketing.  It also did not like smiling babies on infant formula, one of our major businesses.  At some stage it might add that the Bill, if implemented, will cause obesity and-or global warming.  The problem we face is that the knee-jerk reaction in Civil Service circles is to reject every Bill we propose.  We are living in a parliamentary democracy.

A person who had a car for going to work was allowed &euro;50 for depreciation, etc.  Since the beginning of April this facility has been withdrawn.  I phoned the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, yesterday and they told me the legislative basis for it was the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act, introduced on 28 March 2013.  I looked at that Act today in fine detail.  If this change is in that Act I am amazed and it is well hidden but I do not believe it is there.  To coincide with the introduction of that Act the HSE decided to withdraw both these facilities, which means people will lose their medical cards.<\/p><p>Banks encouraged people to take these home-improvement loans.  Yet again, the hard-pressed are being made to pay for this on the double.  I am flabbergasted by this.  It is sneaky and underhanded treatment of people who are up to their tonsils in debt.  Having worked with these people I assure the House that if we take away their mortgages, car loans and home-improvement loans etc., they would be better on the dole.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health and ask him if there should be a legislative basis for the HSE doing this or if it is the case that the HSE cannot be held to account for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400003#B00900","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372930800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Kelly.

I share in the congratulations to the United States of America on this great day, 4 July, the 237th anniversary of the independence of the United States of America.  What would Ireland have achieved if it had 237 years of independence, not just 90?  I commend Senator Kathryn Reilly on bringing forward her report today, Guarantee our Future: A Report on the Need for a Youth Guarantee from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is a very worthwhile report and I recommend our colleagues get it.  It is proof positive that the Seanad has done the State some service, having a young Senator here who can use her talents to bring forward a report of this quality and have it debated.  This should be recognised.<\/p><p>I have put the following point before, and I again propose the establishment of an organisation similar to the US Peace Corps, which would engage up to 50,000 young people, qualified and unqualified, such as plasterers, electricians, labourers, block layers, nurses, teachers and so forth, to use their skills for a limited period in Third World countries.  It would be very similar to the Niall Mellon Township Trust which does enormous work in shanty towns in South Africa.  It would be under the engineering corps of the Irish Army for security and support.  This would be a pilot scheme for Europe.  Instead of just sending out Third World aid money and not being sure who is spending it, where and how, it would be spent employing young people manufacturing houses in Ireland to be built in shanty towns.  This would create enormous opportunities.  We must be more innovative.  Let us do something radical, outside the box and think about this.  We have the skills knowledge and expertise in this House to tease this idea out in a debate this autumn and I ask the Leader to consider this in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400004#C00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1372930800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I agree with the general thrust of Senator Darragh O'Brien's remarks on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.

It is a scandal that we have not had a debate in the House on the banking situation.  Everywhere in the country, people are talking about the Anglo Irish Bank tapes and bankers and they want justice.  They hear the Government talk about an Oireachtas inquiry and they want that to happen as soon as possible.  What they really want, however, is a full criminal investigation which leads to people being brought before the courts.  There are many other issues which must be discussed as well as a criminal investigation, which will obviously have to take its course.  There are many issues with banking that we still need to tease out and discuss.  Everybody except the Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il is being given the opportunity to talk about it.  We should have the opportunity too.<\/p><p>  I join Senator Leyden in commending the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and the youngest Member of the Oireachtas, Senator Kathryn Reilly, on the publication of <i>Guaranteeing our Future<\/i>, a report on youth unemployment.  The Seanad is often criticised for its role, but here is an example of the youngest Member using her time in the House to hold consultation meetings with youth organisations and to bring forward through the committee a report on a very important issue affecting people in the State.  There was a very good attendance by Oireachtas members in the media.  It is an example of how Senators can use the Chamber and committees effectively to deal with important, relevant issues.  Importantly, the document is short and simple and makes clear recommendations underpinned by genuine consultation with affected people, including young unemployed people and the organisations that support them.  In light of what is happening in Europe and discussions on the youth guarantee, towards which the Government appears to be moving, I call for a debate with the relevant Minister in the wake of those discussions and the publication of the joint committee's important report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400005#D04400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1372931400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I congratulate Emily O'Reilly, the new European Ombudsman.

While I take the Cathaoirleach's point about refraining from comment on yesterday's business, I note that the discussion on the important issue of food labelling raised, yet again, the issue of children's health and rising levels of obesity.  I am aware that the Leader has been in negotiations with the Minister for Health to have a debate on the matter in the context of public consultation.  We spoke yesterday about the possibility of asking the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and, perhaps, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, to come to the House to discuss the matter.  The purpose of the debate would be to examine obesity in children, how we feed our children, exercise in schools and food labelling.  It is an enormous long-term difficulty on which we still have not grasped the nettle.  We are approaching the issue piecemeal without putting it centre stage where it ought to be.  The risk to children's health is one thing but the cost to the nation is huge.  While we talk about saving money in many other areas, we are saving a penny to spend a pound later in this case.  It is foolish economics and it puts the lives of our children at risk.

It is salutary to remind the House that not only is there a US Senate, but bicameral systems operate in all of the states and have done so since the 18th century.  Obviously they are doing something right, but the message has not got through to the Taoiseach, who, I am more and more convinced, is on a solo run.  He is increasingly isolated on the bizarre approach he has taken to parliamentary reform.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue that is totally unrelated to what I have just said, namely, that of the national bee colony.  While it may seem like a trivial matter, it is in fact extremely serious.  According to reports in the national newspapers today, the Irish bee colony is declining at an alarming rate.  It is something that started in the United States.  Bees are affected by a viral infection, which has been compounded by the atrociously bad weather we have experienced over the last two years.  When I refer to a serious decline, I mean a decline which has devastating consequences and impacts beyond those who are beekeepers.  It is actually affecting our tourist industry.  We have a very proud record of producing top-class honey in various parts of the country which is marketed as an Irish product abroad.  I ask the Leader to parallel the approach in the UK, where a similarly drastic decline is being experienced.  The UK Government has announced in the last two days that it is initiating an urgent review of the crisis.  I ask that the relevant Minister initiate an urgent review of the crisis in Ireland to establish exactly what the cause of the problem is and how it can be addressed to arrest the alarming decline in the Irish bee colony.  It is obvious that it is a matter within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, possibly, may be a responsibility of the newly appointed Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Tom Hayes, who attended the House last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400005#D04600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1372931400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to arrange at the earliest juncture for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the Seanad before the budget to ensure that the expertise and business acumen represented in the House is put to good use to help salvage the main streets and urban centres of towns up and down the country.

Tourists do not come to Ireland to visit Tesco, Lidl or Aldi.  They come to see the artisan businesses, the family shops and cafes up and down the country.  However, now many of our main streets are left with little other than bars, bookies and burger joints.  There are hollowed out centres and vacant and derelict sites.  It is a scandal and a disgrace and we must intervene and support family-run businesses.  We have the capacity to do so.  There was an urban renewal scheme in the 1980s and something similar could now be used.  It is not as simple as rates; other issues include tax incentives and planning.

I have worked with some of these young people and while they have done wrong in many cases, they have also been let down by society.  Many of the causes are complex.  Sometimes it is because they have had ADHD that has not been treated or they may have been let down by family, the education system, social workers and society.  This is a key group of young people to assist so that they do not reoffend and so that they see futures outside of crime.  That is good for us all because we all want to see crime figures coming down.  We do not want to be growing crime by not treating young people right in detention centres.

The employment issue dovetails with a call this morning by Senator John Whelan for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the revival and rejuvenation of town centres.  Many small businesses are going to the wall and shedding high numbers of employees, many of whom are young people.  The Senator is correct in that it is not an issue of rates alone.  We must look at what we can do as a Government to help stimulate some activity in town centres.<\/p> <p>He is correct when he says many tourists do not want to go to the larger supermarkets.  They want to see the real Ireland in the towns and villages throughout the country.  New businesses sprung up during the Celtic tiger era.  Many of them went to the wall and will not return.  New boutiques, cafes and venues for people to socialise were not sustainable but many long-standing small businesses are feeling the pinch.  I met a businessman recently who closed a men's clothes shop after 18 years in business.  It was in downtown Ballinasloe and he could not survive because the larger supermarkets had located on the edge of the town and all his customers were attracted there and away from the centre of town.  This is a major issue and a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be timely.  This would give Members an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution as to how we might kick-start economic activity in small rural towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400006#E02200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372932600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I raised the matter earlier this week of the obscene literature we have been receiving, which resonated with other Members.

The Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance have come to the House on numerous occasions to discuss banking issues, the insolvency Bill and many others.  I will renew my representations to have the Minister come to the House to speak specifically on the code of conduct.  I cannot assure the House that I will get him to come to the House today but I will renew my representations in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden and other Senators raised the closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  I commend the Minister on that decision.  It is long overdue.  There has been report after report on St. Patrick's Institution so it is a good day for the country that the Minister has decided the institution should now close.  The development of new facilities at Oberstown will commence and in the interim the transfer of all 17 year olds currently serving a sentence in St. Patrick's Institution to a dedicated unit in Wheatfield Prison will go ahead.  The 18 to 20 year old population in the institution will also be transferred to Wheatfield.  It is a positive development that action has been taken after the numerous reports calling for the closure of that institution.<\/p><p>I note Senator Barrett's comments about the Anglo Irish Bank tapes.  I agree with his comments on the Food Provenance Bill.  I understand that Senator Quinn and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, had discussions prior to the Bill being introduced.  It is positive that sponsors of a Bill can discuss matters with a Minister prior to the Bill coming before the House.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly raised the changes that are alleged to have taken place in medical card eligibility.  Perhaps the Senator would table an Adjournment motion on the matter so he can get specific facts on it.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden, Senator Cullinane and others referred to the committee on European affairs and the report of the rapporteur, Senator O'Reilly, on youth unemployment.  I join them in commending our colleague, Senator Reilly, on this report.  It knits in quite well with the negotiations the Taoiseach had in Berlin yesterday on the youth guarantee and youth unemployment.  It is an issue that affects not just our country but all of Europe.  A sum of &euro;6 billion has been set aside by the European Union to address it.  Some would say a great deal more is required but &euro;6 billion is a large sum.  Hopefully it will trickle down and we will see an improvement in our youth unemployment rate in the coming months.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan's comments, which he also made yesterday, that we cannot allow banks to ride roughshod over their mortgage holders and customers.  As I said previously, I will try to get the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss that and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>I note Senator Norris's strong comments on the Seanad abolition Bill.  All Members will have their say.  I believe another 16 Senators will speak on it today and there will be another three and a half hours of debate.  We allocated almost eight hours for debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400008#G02200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1372933200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The vote is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400008#G02300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1372933200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Mullen, we are not prioritising the Seanad Bill over the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.

The number of individuals and organisations which responded is testament to the public interest in the network and in its future.<\/p><p>This is the second significant report on the post office network in the space of a year.  The Irish Postmasters' Union commissioned Grant Thornton to produce a report on the future of the post office network which provides a number of interesting proposals to enhance the viability of the network.<\/p><p>Turning to the report of the Oireachtas committee, in general I agree with the thrust of the report which examines the current configuration of the network, the importance of government contracts and makes suggestions for extra business for post offices.  In its recommendations, the report acknowledges the vital role that post offices play in local communities in both financial and social terms.<\/p> <p> In financial terms, post offices serve as a financial hub and as the front office for Government business and utility providers.  Equally important, the post office serves as a social hub for local communities.  The desirability of channelling more Government business through the network is emphasised, although the requirement to adhere to EU procurement obligations is also recognised.  Improvements to the manner in which An Post handles the closure of post offices are recommended, as is the desirability of managing the cost of operating the network.  The recommendations reflect a common-sense approach to improving the viability and sustainability of the network and I am pleased to say many of the suggestions made have been adopted, at least in part, by An Post.  <\/p><p>The local post office is seen as an immutable, unchanging part of the Irish landscape.

While offices might look traditional on the outside, the network has experienced some significant developments, the most significant of which is that it is now fully computerised.  This investment was necessary, as post offices now operate in an increasingly competitive environment and face challenges from other retailers with electronic payment options and from online payment channels.  The national payments strategy envisages the increased use of card payments in order to align our payments infrastructure with that of competitor countries.  Financial institutions and utilities can make significant savings in switching customers to online channels and many are aggressively doing so.<\/p><p>An Post has responded to these changes and, to be fair to the company, the network has come a long way in the past ten years.  The investment in computerisation has broadened the range of services which can be offered to customers and increased the number of organisations which are prepared to do business with An Post.  In order to illustrate the scale of the changes, I will briefly list some of the services now available which have been introduced in the past ten years: banking business with AIB and Danske Bank such as cash lodgements which generate over 4 million transactions per year; foreign exchange for cash and card transitions; and One for All gift vouchers.  It is also worth mentioning that State savings worth &euro;17 billion, which represent over 15% of household deposits in Ireland, are handled by the network.  Again, the extra business has translated into increased payments for postmasters, growing from &euro;55 million in 2003 to &euro;79 million in 2012.<\/p><p>In addition, the post office network secures about &euro;126 million worth of business from the Government each year.  The most significant contract is that with the Department of Social Protection.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, that An Post has been selected as the preferred bidder for the social welfare payments cash contract.  This is very good news for the network as, in addition to the social welfare payments, much of the bill payment and other revenue streams flow from the social welfare business.  The fact that An Post won the contract after a competitive process augers well for the future of the post office.  As I have mentioned, the reality is that electronic payments options will become the norm, including for welfare clients.  Strengths such as automation, the physical scale of the network and the strong ethos of customer service will allow An Post to continue to be involved in welfare payments and I understand it will pitch strongly for e-payment business when it is put out to tender.<\/p><p>With the social welfare contract secured, continuing to build on the strengths of the network to obtain extra business is the next step.  I agree with the Oireachtas joint committee's report that there is scope to generate more business from the financial services sector and the Government.  The report recognises that extra business will be won through a tendering process or that business is offered to all players with point of sale facilities. <\/p><p>The model operated for the payment of the property tax also brought a new concept to the post office, namely, user charges for making payments.  While I understand these charges are not popular, they represent a fairly simple way of generating extra business and, by extension, extra revenue for the network.  After all, customers clearly value the network and the access it provides.  While the social dimension is important, the economic reality is that individual post offices are not viable unless the postmaster can make a living from the business.  If the payment of a small user charge helps to secure the future of individual post offices, I doubt that many customers would begrudge it.<\/p><p>The public sector reform agenda being pursued by the Government includes the use of outsourcing options in some circumstances.  I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to suggest the post office network is ideally placed to service more Government transaction services.  I understand An Post has met officials from that Department to explore options.<\/p><p>I agree with the Oireachtas joint committee that An Post should have a strong input into the roll-out of the basic bank account as many of the potential users of these accounts are already customers of An Post and know and are comfortable with using the post office.  Again, I will continue to remind my colleagues, in particular the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that without the post office network, it is difficult to see the adoption of these accounts gaining major traction.  When I addressed the postmasters' annual conference in May, I mentioned they also had a strong role in improving customer experience such as extended opening hours, where appropriate, and improved layouts, especially as the amount of cash throughput decreased in offices.<\/p><p>The post office network is the largest retail network in the country.  In a network of that size, inevitably, there will be closures and I understand the upset this can cause in local communities.  It would be fair to say the process adopted by An Post where a post office was to be closed was less than transparent in the past.  In response to my efforts with An Post and pressure from the Oireachtas joint committee, a new protocol for closures has been introduced.  It has been used six times in the last year and given local communities a greater say on whether a post office should be retained.<\/p><p>I again thank the Acting Chairman for the invitation to address the House.  I welcome the publication of the report of the Oireachtas joint committee and the opportunity it gives to discuss the future of the network.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Members of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400012#L00500","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1372934700,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I was one of the lucky few who received a copy of his statement.  It is quite light on detail and I can advise other Members not to scramble to obtain a copy. <\/p><p>I have some questions for the Minister.  As he knows, I have a lot of regard for him.  While he welcomed publication of the report of the joint committee, does he accept it or any of its specific recommendations?  It is positive that he has welcomed the report, but I draw his attention to recommendation No. 5, namely, that the post office network be considered for use in paying other State charges such as motor tax, hospital charges, water charges, property tax, business rates and other such payments.<\/p><p>The Minister and many of his ministerial colleagues have consistently stated they fully support ensuring the post office network is sustainable.<\/p> <p>That is certainly welcome, but what is the Government actually doing to ensure it happens?  Most of the changes we have seen within the post office network in recent years were driven by private sector operators, particularly the banks, outsourcing some of their functions to the network.  I fully appreciate the level of financial expenditure by the State in the area of social protection and the payments that go through the post office network.  I am, however, trying to square the circle with regard to the plan outlined by the Minister for Social Protection whereby, by December 2017, only 3% of social welfare payments, as compared with the current figure of 50%, will be made by way of cash transactions.  I accept the need for savings and the importance of security.  However, if that plan is implemented, what will fill the gap in terms of the threat to the viability of the post office network?  If it is done without the provision of support in the areas I mentioned, such as motor tax renewals, we will probably see an additional 400 post offices closing throughout the country.  None of us wants that to happen.<\/p><p>This is an issue of particular concern in rural areas.  We have already seen the closure, for example, of a large number of rural Garda stations and banks.  We heard this week that Ulster Bank is to close between 38 and 41 of its branches in the State.  Many rural people see the local post office almost as the last bastion of their communities.  Post offices perform functions which banks simply do not.  I commend An Post, both management and workers, on the level of service it provides to customers.  It far exceeds the service provided by banks, which no longer want any customers coming through their doors.  That is patently obvious to anybody who goes into a bank, where it is usual practice to have only one teller in place at any given time.  It is important, therefore, that we support the post office network.<\/p><p>I am concerned at the canard thrown out by the Minister - one which previous Ministers in previous Governments also put forward - in regard to EU procurement rules.  We in this country have followed those guidelines to the very letter of the law.  We do not unbundle tenders as is done in France and other member states.  A minimum of 17% of all State business goes abroad, and it is probably closer to 40% in practice.  I worked on a report on this issue in the last D&aacute;il, in my capacity as Vice Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and in conjunction with the then Chairman, former Deputy Bernard Allen.  I wholeheartedly agree that we must abide by EU procurement law.  At the same time, however, we would do well to be a bit more clever in how we go about it.  We might, for instance, consider unbundling tenders to allow An Post a better chance of winning them.  I often point out in these discussions that the French police drive Citroens because, in doing so, they are supporting French business.  Many of our fellow member states do not really give two hoots about EU procurement law.  In fact, the average across the Union for overseas expenditure by states is some 2% of total spending.  The closest to Ireland is Cyprus on 6%.  That is an issue of concern to me.<\/p><p>The Minister referred in some detail to State savings, which are worth &euro;17 billion.  I agree with the points he made in this regard.  I am concerned, however, that the changes the Government has made in terms of the interest paid on those savings will see a sizeable reduction in that book of business.  A similar reduction in prize bonds sales is a likely consequence of the reduction in prize funds, another change the Government managed to slip under the radar.<\/p><p>The fundamental issue here is whether the Government has an actual plan for the post office network.  The Minister referred to the Grant Thornton report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters Union and the report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications.  There has, however, been no plan from Government.  The Minister must take a lead on this, in collaborations with his colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Finance.  We are all agreed that our post office network is vital; the challenge is to ensure it is sustainable.  The committee has done a good job in its recommendations, but I would like to see the Minister being more specific in terms of the actions he intends to take on foot of those recommendations.<\/p><p>The Minister indicated that he has written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform suggesting that the post office network is ideally placed to service a broader range of Government transactions.  Will he elaborate on this suggestion?  What, for example, is his definition of &quot;more&quot;?  Did he ask his colleague to consider specific services such as motor tax renewals?  That information would be very helpful.  I thank the Minister for attending this debate and assure him of my intention to offer constructive engagement on this issue.  We all want to ensure the viability of the post office network, but that requires a proper plan with which everybody can get on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400012#L00600","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372935300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I take this opportunity to thank the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and its former Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes, for their efforts in producing this report.  I wish Deputy Hayes well in his new role as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>  According to the committee's report, An Post currently has 1,050 post offices in Ireland and some 9,500 staff, both full-time and part-time.  It is, therefore, a major employer with a network that operates in every part of the country.  This report adds greatly to the debate on the role of the post office network in this State in the 21st century.  As a consequence of Ireland's obligation to comply with the third EU postal directive, we have seen sweeping changes to the postal service.  This process began with the decision by the Council in 1994 to open national postal markets to competition.  Directive No. 97\/67\/EC, which issued in December 1997, set out common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services.<\/p><p>  The market in Ireland has been open to competition since 2000, which has seen significant benefits for end users of postal services.  An Post's designation as universal postal service provider has helped to safeguard its key role in the delivery and collection of mail.  ComReg, as the designated national regulatory authority for postal services, granted An Post its designation for a 12-year period.  There have been many changes for users of postal services over the years.  The age of the telegram is long gone.  Personal letter volumes have fallen as technological innovations led to greater use of electronic mail.  Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are increasingly used as primary methods of communication.  Mobile telephone texting is probably the main medium of communication among young people and adults alike.  It is a fast-changing world in which stakeholders must constantly adapt and develop new services if they are to prosper.<\/p><p>  In that context, it is important to acknowledge that the local post office, as much as the local shop, is a vital focal point in rural areas.  Of the 4.6 million people living in Ireland in 2011, 1.74 million, according to the census, resided in rural areas.  We cannot afford to see the post office network become obsolete.  It must adapt and be innovative in the services it offers.  After all, the days of selling stamps and delivering letters are no more.  There is competition out there, including potentially from operators who are interested only in making a profit from the Irish market and have little regard for social responsibilities.  I agree that Ireland, with a population of 4.6 million and a large, dispersed rural population, cannot be compared with Sweden, whose population of 9 million is concentrated around cities. <\/p><p>  The joint Oireachtas committee made nine recommendations in its report.  It recognises the social benefit of providing advice and face-to-face contact in rural areas.  I have spoken to people living alone who go from day to day without any contact with another person except when they go to the local post office to collect their pension.  There are 136,000 people aged 65 and over living alone in this country, according to the census.  Given our aging population, that figure is set to rise rapidly in the coming years.  We have an obligation to ensure that people can access services as close as possible to where they live.  No provider should be allowed to cherry-pick the areas in which they will operate.<\/p><p>  The report recommends the continued delivery of Government services to the public.  In 2012 the Irish Postmasters Union commissioned a report by Grant Thornton.  Given that the current social welfare and National Treasury Management Agency contracts make up 29 and 27%, respectively, of the post office network's retail revenue, that report reflected a considerable concern that its viability might be under threat.  In this regard, I welcome the extension of the social welfare contract for a further two years, which will afford An Post more time to develop alternative income streams.  Several reports have identified particular services which it could and should be offering, such as motor tax renewals and payment of business rates, local authority rents and hospital charges.  I welcome the facility to pay the property tax at one's local post office.<\/p> <p>It is a pity this facility was not available last year with the household charge.  Other financial collecting services that are currently carried out by local government could be carried out in local post offices.  In addition, with the closure of rural Garda stations which were only open for a few hours daily, some services, such as providing insurance documents, licences and passport application forms, could be carried out at local post offices.  Items could be scanned and e-mailed to the relevant Garda database and passport office, etc.<\/p><p> The <i>Financial Times<\/i>reported in January this year that Scotland Yard and the postal service are looking at this type of service.  Local post offices are open five and a half days a week and this time should be exploited to the maximum.  The report also recommended an early warning system, whereby local communities would have advance notice if their local post office was in danger of closure.  This is a very good idea.  There is nothing better to catch one's attention about a service that you one takes for granted, than the threat of its disappearance or closure.  We have had this experience over the past couple of months in County Clare. <\/p><p> The committee identified a phenomenon, particularly in rural areas, whereby the resignation of postmasters and mistresses is leading to the closure of local post offices.  The committee heard from Donal Connell, CEO of An Post, that one-third of resignations by postmasters since 2011 resulted in post office closures.  Some will say that younger people are not attracted to the challenge of taking on a post office as a career option.  I say that if the conditions are there to provide a livelihood, they will queue up to take them on.  The more services post offices offer, the more people will come through the door.  While post offices offer some banking services, there is scope for more to be added along with some local credit union services.  In the age of the microchip anything is possible if we put our minds to it.  We produce IT graduates of the highest calibre every year and should employ them to come up with new systems for the post office network that will offer fast, secure, cost effective methods of operating.<\/p><p> The committee's report states: &quot;The department of Finance's strategy for Financial Inclusion 2011 also refers to the important role that An Post could play in the creation of a Basic Payment Account&quot;.  The banks recognise the growth in the services it offers through the post office network, with AIB reporting that more than 3 million AIB transactions took place in the post offices.  Bank of Ireland and Danske Bank also recognise An Post as a suitable business partner.  As we are all aware from announcements made this week, Ulster Bank proposes to close more of its branches, both here and in the North.  Post offices should be allowed to fill this vacuum.  They should not be tied to one or two particular banks, but be able to offer customers of all the banks the same common services they get in their local branches.<\/p><p> I am somewhat confused with regard to recommendation No. 9 of the report which states: &quot;The committee recognises that the introduction of postal codes will lead to efficiencies through changes to work practices.  However, the committee expresses concern as to whether some of these changes, involving likely centralisation of sorting, could have negative impacts on the viability of rural post offices.&quot;  In fact, post goes every night to central locations to be sorted.  Once the letter is put in the post box, we need it to get to the recipient as quickly and efficiently as possible.  A proper post code will speed this up and will make deliveries to rural areas quicker.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister takes on board the recommendations of report.  I have no doubt he will and no doubt that the future of the postal network is bright.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400013#M00200","speaker":"1134","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372935900,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted we are having this discussion on the sustainability of the Irish post office network.<\/p><p>Our post office network is undervalued and few people fully appreciate and consider the vital and important role it plays in Ireland's social fabric.  Undoubtedly, with the rapid developments in new forms of instant communication, its importance has been diluted somewhat.  Nevertheless, it remains a significant player in the functioning of Ireland's communications infrastructure.  I would like to draw attention to the following facts.  An Post is a major commercial organisation, providing a wide range of services, encompassing postal, communication, retail and financial services.  It is one of Ireland's largest companies, directly employing over 10,000 people through its national network of retail, processing and delivery points.  Each week, 1.7 million Irish citizens visit the network of over 1,050 post offices nationwide.  Each day, some 2.5 million mail items are delivered to 2.1 million businesses and residential addresses.<\/p><p>These details illustrate the fact that our postal network is extremely vibrant, whether concerned with the servicing of Irish business needs or assisting people in their daily tasks, particularly people in remote, isolated areas of the country.  However, the current Government's attitude to our postal network needs close scrutiny.  The Minister will tell me that the Government's position on the network is clear, as it has vowed to protect it in its programme for Government.  This is of little comfort to me.  Perhaps I am becoming increasingly cynical about the promises and commitments offered in politics by governments and parties.  I judge people and governments by their actions rather than their words.  For this reason, I am deeply concerned for the future of our postal network.<\/p><p>In the past, I have spoken in this Chamber about the lifeblood of local communities right across the country, focusing my comments on small businesses in the main.  However, I feel that 400 post offices right across the State symbolise and are at the heart or our communities.  We must strive to protect them.  As we are aware, post office income is based on each transaction processed on behalf of clients and customers.  This brings me to my main concern if the Government presses ahead with its drive for all social welfare payments to be delivered electronically by the end of 2014.  This will decimate the income of post offices as the social welfare contracts account for 35% of post office business.  Such a move will result in post offices being forced to close as they will no longer be viable.  This will be a catastrophe for the network and communities, both urban and rural.  This move would see the lifeblood ripped out of communities who depend on their post offices for saving money, paying bills, buying postal orders or stamps, obtaining dollars or sterling commission free, using passport express and paying Garda fines and many other expenses.  I am not being dramatic here, just pointing out that this is what will happen in a few years if we do not think clearly now and make the right move.<\/p><p>Leaving business aside, post offices are also an important point of social contact for many vulnerable and elderly citizens.  The closure of some post offices would lead to people having to travel long distances to obtain services such as those I have outlined.  Some will travel, others will not and some will simply not be able to travel to another post office.  At a time when our not so kind-hearted banks are closing branches right across the country, in a drive to encourage people to bank electronically so as to enable banks cut costs and boost profits, the Government must proceed with extreme caution when it comes to any decision which may lead to post office closures, which ultimately results in less consumer choice and increased social isolation.<\/p><p>I am all for creating sustainable businesses and the environment to allow this happen.  My passion to see the post office network protected is not based on a false, nostalgic postcard picture of a lovely post office.  My vision is based on a sound and tested business model for the network.  It is an added plus that this will have a positive social impact.  The Minister might well ask what this vision is.  Senators will be glad to know that the Government could not make this all happen with the stroke of a pen, but it could be done with not much more than that.  Simply, the Government needs to direct more government business through the network.  I welcome the analogy Senator O'Brien made with Citroen in France - EU procurement rules how are you.  The French approach with Citroen works well.<\/p><p>The recent report by Grant Thornton found that if motor tax renewals alone were diverted through the post offices, this would save taxpayers some &euro;60.6 million.  Other services which could be directed to the post office network include: over the counter payments for water charges, local authority rents, driving licence renewals, electronic signing-on, the updating of the register of electors and credit union transactions.  The options and choices for protecting the post office network are vast.  There is no excuse for us arriving at a situation where there is widespread closure of post offices or any further dilution of the network.  It is time for the Government to act and to live up to its promise in the programme for Government to protect the postal network. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400014#N00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1372935900,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Senator John Kelly.  I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  In many towns in Ireland the post office is where people make contact with their neighbours.  Nowadays many people live in estates but do not meet their neighbours on the street.  However, once a week or more often they meet them in the post office, which most often also has a small shop attached to supplement its income.<\/p> <p>I refer to the important news last week from the Minister for Social Protection about the other preferred bidder for dealing with social welfare payments.  I live in Letterkenny and this week, a second post office was opened in a built up area of the town.  I have been calling for such a facility for years but for some reason, An Post would not contemplate a second post office even though there is a queue of 80 yds to 100 yds long every day outside the Letterkenny post office.  I raised the matter two years ago at the local town council.  Members of the town council who had outside interests voted against it while the same councillors welcomed the recent opening of the second post office.  I will not go into the details of why they voted against it.  An Post was very slow to recognise the need for a second post office when every person and every dog in the street can see customers are queuing in the rain and demanding a second post office.  It took An Post about three to five years to come to that conclusion.<\/p><p>I do not understand the thinking in An Post generally but I welcome the opportunity for An Post to provide extra services.  At one time, the town of Raphoe had a post office, three banks, two building societies and now it has one bank, one post office and a credit union.  There is an opportunity for An Post to develop its services in all areas.  I proposed that the motor tax should be payable through the post office system 25 years ago when I was in business in Raphoe.  People were taking out car insurance with me and then they had to go to Lifford to queue up to pay their motor tax.  The county manager at the time said my suggestion was a good idea but he said the Revenue and the tax service would not allow that to happen.  I ask the Minister to clarify if motor tax payments and other services could be facilitated at An Post offices in the future.  The Revenue deals with the property tax but in my view motor tax is straightforward.  County council charges are another payment that could be dealt with at the post office counters.  It does not matter the size of the office because the post office provides a vital service.<\/p><p>The future of post offices is more secure now than previously.  The closure of bank branches could be an ill wind because the post offices can deal with money lodgments and it may be time to consider allowing customers to withdraw money from their bank accounts at the post office counter.  For example, Raphoe has one ATM  in the town - this situation is quite common in other towns - and if it is not working the nearest town is nearly ten miles away.  Some shops are able to supply cash to customers but this is not always available.  The post office is open on Saturdays and could provide cash when the banks are closed or the ATM is out of order which is a regular occurrence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400014#N00300","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372936500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have always been a strong supporter of the small rural post office.  I have said on many occasions that every effort should be made to retain them.  I have a historical vested interest in that my father grew up in a post office and my sister has continued as the post mistress in the same post office.  I must inform the Minister that she is not making a fortune, she is just ticking over.  I am in favour of post offices providing a variety of services.  Other speakers have made passionate pleas for retention of postal services but one cannot put a price on the social service which the post office provides.  The postmaster knows his customers.  He knows when Mary does not turn up as usual on a Wednesday that something may be amiss and he will act on that.  Many of the banks are closing branches in small rural towns and customers must do their banking in an adjacent town.  Social welfare payments are payable in small post offices and the postmaster of postmistress knows his or her customers.  I would say that multiple identity fraud is rampant in this country but at least the postmaster will know whether a person has the correct social welfare card.  I spent 28 years as a community welfare officer dealing with people on social welfare.  If money is paid into a bank account the payee could be in Timbuktu and it could take six months to find out and all the while the money is being paid out.  I am concerned at any threat that the post office network might lose the social welfare tender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400015#O00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1372936500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is well known for his wisdom and his wit although I do not know whether this topic will lend itself to that.<\/p><p>  Great credit is due to the post office, as the Minister said, for the way in which it has transformed in light of the very strong decline in mail volumes.  I note An Post made &euro;2.2 million profit in 2011 and it has reduced its staff by 1,200.  The company has adapted and remained profitable and this is to its credit.  Many other bodies in both the private and public sectors did not adapt to a changing market.  I note the Minister's statement that the payments to the postmasters rose from &euro;55 million in 2003 to &euro;79 million in 2002.  The business has re-orientated away from the transfer of mail to the financial services that the Minister has described.<\/p><p>  It was strange that the rate of interest from the post office was reduced on foot of pressure from the banks.  The Irish Banking Federation issued a statement that it was in favour of this reduction because it was in favour of fair competition.  That was a remarkable body to endorse fair competition, having walked out of Government Buildings with &euro;64 billion or maybe &euro;90 billion on 29 September.  A case could be made that a post office which did not go bankrupt is able to pay its savers more than outfits which did go bankrupt.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.  A part of the utility function of banking was to promote thrift and savings, particularly among young people.  Banks used to do this before they were taken over by the casino types and perhaps there is a role for the post office.  <\/p><p>  I refer to Senator O'Brien's point about electronic payments and the payment of social welfare benefits.  In the trash section of my computer I have electronic communications from banks with which I have never had an account.  Therefore, I avoid electronic payments and I stick with the cheque book.  I suggest the Minister, Deputy Burton, should beware of using the electronic method for social welfare payments.  Ulster Bank went AWOL about a year ago and it was forced to apologise profusely to people.  I ask if this technology will be able to deliver and how does it compare with the current reliable system.<\/p><p>  I hear warm praise for the passport application system through the postal system as being an excellent alternative to a queue in Molesworth Street.  Regulations exist to prevent money-laundering through use of prize bonds.  However, a little old lady attempting to buy a present of a prize bond for her grandson is not likely to be a front for some criminal organisation.  I suggest the Minister might have discussions with An Post on that matter.  I hear praise also for the provision of foreign currency and gift vouchers.  A minor cavil would be that very fine boxes of stamps bought in bundles were replaced by just bundles.  I found the boxes much more useful.  <\/p><p>  I agree with the Minister that the opening hours need to be examined.  Some competitors based in filling stations, for example, are open longer.  The post office has a problem with the queues in its offices and it may take time to reach the top of the queue. <\/p> <p>I have some other thoughts allied to the fortunes of the post office.  As a consumer I am wary of the post codes proposal which I understand the Minister is bringing to Cabinet.  My constituency includes people on both sides of the Border.  Clones is in County Monaghan so I can write to my constituents there but I can never remember what the codes are for Lisnaskea, to give an example of ten or 12 miles down the road.  I read last week in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the post codes system is estimated to cost &euro;15 million, plus an annual running cost of &euro;2.5 million.  I thought it was intended to save money.  Might we have a full cost benefit analysis of that proposal?  Undoubtedly, there are salesmen for such technology, going around telling us it is wonderful, saying they would like &euro;15 million of public money.  Will we be better off afterwards?<\/p><p> The other proposal concerns the television licence for people who do not have a television, which I find very strange.  I can think of variations - a dog licence fee for people who do not have a dog, which would bring in a very large amount of money.  It introduces a new principle to public finances - being taxed for something one does not have.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will give the Minister a special prize for that idea but I would be reluctant to go there, even if more people without television sets would be buying such licences in the local post office.<\/p><p> In general, progress has been made in a difficult situation and I commend the Minister and the post office management, the postmasters and their employees.  They have a very splendid public image in the way they serve the country which is good to hear in times of recession.  I commend all involved, from the Minister down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400015#O00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372937100,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.

I think it was in Ballinasloe that the people involved told me that the night before they had discovered one letter that had not been delivered because it had slipped between two drawers.  They went out and found somebody who would deliver it that night, all because of their commitment to ensure that service was delivered.  That is a huge strength.  It is one of the reasons I believe there is need to listen very well to customers.  In my own business I always spent time each week, and arranged for everybody else to do the same, doing the actual work of the business.  I encouraged the senior executives in An Post to go and work in the post offices, whether delivering the mail, being behind a desk doing pensions, or whatever.  Some said, \"We did that 20 years ago, Chairman\".  I told them a lovely seanfhocal I remembered, \"&Eacute;ist le fuaim na h-abhainn agus gheobhaidh t&uacute; breac\".  Listen to the sound of the river if you want to catch a fish and you will catch a fish.  I told them the water in that river was not the same as it was last week, last year, or 20 years ago.  One really needs to keep in touch with what is happening.<\/p><p>There are so many developments that would benefit An Post, as a number of speakers have indicated, including the Minister.  Post offices can be the glue that keeps a community together, particularly in rural areas.  There must be things we can do on that basis.  If one goes around Europe, one seldom goes into a post office where one does not see a very broad range of services.  We are touching some of these here, whether banking, insurance or retailing, but one sees that range of goods on offer.  We can do the same.  In the past I have had the opportunity to visit post offices in New Zealand and Japan, both of which have privatised their post office system.  I do not say this should not be considered - everything should be considered at this time.  An Post has the ability to expand because it is trusted by the population to a considerable degree.  Some 18% of our population are &quot;unbanked&quot; - a nice word.  As the movement away from cash takes place something of that kind will happen here.<\/p><p>It is interesting to see what happens in France.  Taxes there are collected to a very large extent by the post office; so are rates, electricity bills and motor taxes, which were mentioned today.  I imagine we have all been approached, as I was, by the Irish Postmasters Union which is concerned about the anti-money laundering movement that will affect prize bonds.  They believe if there is to be anti-money laundering the rate should not be as low as &euro;25 but should be set at &euro;100.  I doubt very much if money launderers are going to launder sums of money at that level.  <\/p><p>Another issue is the delivery of mail.  In 1983, when relevant legislation was going through, there was a big battle to ensure there would be delivery to each home.  Is that still on?  Does it make sense?  When one goes to France, and other countries, in particular the United States-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400016#P00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1372937100,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I am sorry,  I did not hear that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400016#P00500","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1372937100,"counter":172,"content":"<p>In 1983 the new postal regulations stated that delivery to every home was a condition and this was included in the legislation, at the behest of the unions who were very worried that they might lose out.  That was 30 years ago and I wonder if the same should still apply.  When one goes to other countries one sees post boxes at the beginning of a road or an estate, or in the centre of the town, so that people collect their own mail rather than have door to door delivery.  I realise this would not be popular and is not something the postal unions would be happy to see.  There is a word for another service - parcel hotel - and it is interesting to see these items dotted around.  With increasing Internet shopping it does not make sense for the Internet provider to make deliveries to a home where there is nobody present during the day.  That is well thought out and is something An Post could be doing - perhaps it already is.<\/p><p>The steps the Minister has taken and is taking, having his eye on the ball, encourages the management of An Post.

The post office network is a key natural and rural resource so we should not measure its success primarily on financial measurability.  The socio-economic impact of a post office must also be taken into account.  I take a certain amount of umbrage with one of the suggestions made by Senator Quinn, namely, that we look at privatisation of the post office service.  I hope we do not.  If we go down that route it will sound a death knell, particularly to rural postal services.<\/p><p>It is important that the post office network is seen as more than a commercial entity.  It serves an important social role in communities throughout the country.  Obviously there are problems in the network, with falling revenues, branch closures and a high dependence on the single contract with the Department of Social Protection.  Based on an analysis of the staffing systems, the network has the capability of easily facilitating additional services, something we would all like to see.  Currently, turnover is derived from the three main sources outlined, traditional mail service, Government contracts and financial services.  Banking accounts for 3% of revenue, social welfare 29%, NTMA saving contracts 27% and traditional post 16%.  Taken together, this means social welfare and NTMA contracts account for 56% of total revenue so it is obvious we need to diversify, if possible.  There is a high dependence on State-related contracts for survival and therefore the State's role in maintaining postal services and the network is very important.  <\/p><p>In terms of strength, the network is Ireland's largest retail network, with more than 1,100 post offices in the country.  It has a very strong brand and is a household name, with positive customer perception.<\/p> <p>It is a household name with positive customer perception and a large customer base.  It enjoys a considerable goodwill and trust and also provides community and social centres.  Those who work in the system possess impressive local knowledge.  It has the capacity to handle additional businesses.  However, it also has certain weaknesses.  It is heavily dependent on State contracts and its offerings are inconsistent.  Its financial performance has been varied and it has faced restrictions on marketing.  The remuneration system is possibly outdated and inconsistent.<\/p><p>Other Senators have suggest potential sources of income, such as motor tax, court services and fines, local authority charges and ticket sales.  In my area of Connemara, the Courts Service's decision to close the administrative office of the local court left people asking how they might pay fines locally.  This could be an opportunity for An Post.  Reference was made to EU legislation and the fact that competition rules may make it more difficult for An Post to tender for certain contracts.  Can the EU also offer benefits, such as some kind of communications or information disseminating element that could be done through the post office network?  For example, the EU has established information points in libraries so that people can find out about the service it makes available.  Could we tap into the EU for potential contracts for the dissemination of information or services?<\/p><p>I am concerned that An Post is urbanising services.  Our current debate is about its office but postal staff provide an extremely important resource.  In the hinterland of Galway city, An Post is pushing to urbanise services by not replacing retiring staff in rural areas within a radius of ten to 15 miles of Galway.  It is important that post masters and delivery staff are based in communities.<\/p><p>Complaints have been made about the lack of communication with communities in regard to changes.  The Government should be rural proofing any policies that are introduced.  We have tabled a Private Members' motion on this subject.  If, for example, the Minister for Social Protection was required to rural proof all of the policies she introduced, the closure of rural post offices might be prevented because they would be in a better position to retain the social welfare contracts.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to publish the criteria for analysing the viability of post offices.  What makes a post office viable from the Government's perspective?  If the Department of Social Protection proceeds further with electronic payments, 400 post offices could be in jeopardy.<\/p><p>Will the most recent proposal on post codes be sent to open tender and will they be GPS based?

This is why An Post is in good hands with him.  The post office network is a strong brand.  Not many people realise the variety of services that it provides.  PostPoint is a strong product.  The national lottery is also operated by An Post.  We should move to a position whereby the post office is more a one-stop Government shop than a post office.  There is no reason small financial transactions between citizens and the Government should not take place in post offices.  One should be able to purchase a dog licence or pay a parking fine in the post office.  Not everybody is Internet aware.<\/p><p>The 1,100 post offices in the network can remain financially successful.  We had bad local government in the past because we did not need as many local area offices.  The post office network could have managed many of the financial transactions that are currently being carried out in area offices.<\/p><p>I look forward to seeing the ten year strategic plan that the Minister and his officials are working with An Post to prepare.

There is a large degree of agreement on the strong points of An Post but I would be churlish to avoid the points of disagreement raised.  As Senator Conway pointed out, the brand enjoys tremendous recognition, respect and trust.  That is a worthwhile place from which to start.  I agree with Senator Quinn that the commitment of An Post's workers to delivering a public service is recognised throughout the country.<\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien asked whether I was going to respond to specific issues.  He referred in particular to recommendation No. 5 on providing additional Government services through the post office network.  I can respond specifically to that recommendation.  Payment of the property tax is one example of the services that post offices already offer.  An Post and its postmasters have acknowledged the need to diversify, create new products and provide services at their counters.  They have been doing that.  The Senator also referred to hospital charges.  A pilot scheme is in operation with the HSE to investigate what might be done on hospital charges.<\/p><p>His comments reflected a central theme in this debate but we must be practical about these matters.  There is a good reason most local authority tenants go to their local authority offices to pay rent, namely, because they will also be conducting other business related to the fact that they are renting from the local authority.  It is not a matter of one size fits all.  An Post's management has been imaginative in developing new services but it makes sense to make certain payments elsewhere.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's central point was that all I have to do is direct Government business to An Post.  I am saddened that a person of such business acumen and well-known altruistic disposition has been infected by the cynicism she observes in the environment of this House.  She claimed that it is only the Government's cynicism that threatens the future of the post office network and that all I need to do is direct business to post offices.  However, we live in a deregulated environment.  I cannot direct contract business to the post office network.<\/p> <p>There are rules and regulations, regardless of whether we like them, that require these matters to be put out to tender, just like the contract at the Department of Social Protection, which An Post won fair and square.  I would not, therefore, be permitted to do it and not because I necessarily disagree fundamentally with what Senator Darragh O'Brien said about the operation of procurement in Ireland when compared with countries such as France.  I am in large measure in agreement with him.<\/p><p>One of the things I have learned since the banking crash is that perhaps not all 28 member states are as equal as we might have thought they were in the official babble.  We scrupulously apply procurement and state aid rules.  My colleagues and officials in different Departments say this is because we are required to do so, that we are monitored closely and that we largely get the benefit of this.  There is no doubt, however, that it also imposes serious demands on us in their preparation and duration and sometimes that confers disadvantage on us.  That is a fact.  Nonetheless, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien is addressing the central point running through many contributions, that the post office is manifestly good, is held in very high regard by citizens, that all the Government has to do is direct more contracts to An Post and everything will be grand and that a Government that does not do this is cynical.  It is not that we are cynical.  I would like to see An Post adapting, modernising and innovating, as Senator Tony Mulcahy argued, to ensure it can compete with the best.  We passed a postal Bill in this House not too long ago which made it plain that we were functioning in a deregulated environment.  If we look at the rate at which e-commerce is growing in Ireland - it was worth &euro;3.7 billion last year, 76% of which came from outside - there are competing companies here for that business.  It is a matter for An Post to make sure it can do this as efficiently, if not better.  I cannot roll back the clock in that regard.  It is the environment in which we are operating.<\/p><p>It is not a cynical Government that is responsible for the challenges confronting An Post - either this Government or its predecessors - but the changing environment.  It is technology.  The core business of An Post which was to deliver mail has been challenged by e-substitution; it is changing technology, deregulation and other big issues which challenge An Post.  As has been acknowledged by a number of Senators, it is adapting.  The postmasters produced their own report in which they acknowledged that they had to adapt, innovate and think about new services and provide in their premises for the idea of a one-stop-shop, as mentioned by a number of Senators.<\/p><p>I am in sympathy with a number of issues raised such as an exemption for prize bonds, a matter raised by Senators Sean D. Barrett, Feargal Quinn and others.  That makes good sense to me and we have been in communication with the Minister.  There are already discussions taking place to which I hope the Minister will agree.  I cannot let Senator Sean D. Barrett away without referring to his remarks about the television licence for people who did not have a television, which he said was like everybody who did not have a dog having to pay for a dog licence.  The difference is that one cannot take the mutt for a virtual walk with one's iPad or iPhone.  The generation coming after Senator Sean D. Barrett and me get their public service content from smart phones and smart tablets and platforms other than the traditional television set in the corner of the room.  Therefore, it comes down to whether we believe there is any particular value in maintaining public service broadcasting.  If there is such a value and people access this broadcasting through means other than the traditional television set in the corner of the room, it seems they should be required to pay for it.  A non-dog owner cannot resort to his iPhone on a Sunday evening and take the mutt for a virtual walk.<\/p><p>The postcodes issue was raised by Senators Sean D. Barrett, Feargal Quinn, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others.  I can confirm that I put the implementation of a postcode system out to final tender last week.  Obviously, I cannot go into financial considerations for very obvious reasons.  The bidders will return their tenders by the end of the month and we will evaluate them in August.  I will bring a recommendation to the Government in September.  The Senators should not rely on the figures about which they have read in the newspapers.  They did not come from me and I am happy that the CBA that will accompany the postcodes will show that there is considerable advantage to the State, not just for businesses connected with logistics and other areas but also for public service agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which need this information.  The services will be more efficient and delivery will be cheaper in the long run.  We can have a separate discussion about that issue at some time, but as it is at the tender stage, I do not want to go into detail.<\/p><p>I accept what Senator Jimmy Harte has said.  We opened a new post office in Letterkenny recently.  The protocol on closures is working quite well.  Senator Darragh O'Brien asked whether we had a plan.  We do.  We are in an environment that is changing significantly.  Many of the stakeholders have already put their views into the public domain, like the Irish Postmasters Union.  The Department has had NewERA carrying out an assessment of An Post today, while the board and management of An Post will have the basis of a five year plan with us in a few months.  That five year plan will have to look at some of the more central issues raised in the debate this afternoon.  The brand is trusted and plays an important role in Irish society, but there are major challenges in the way things have changed.  We have to take this on board.<\/p><p>I am a rebel in the Government on the State savings issue.<\/p> <p>I have made my view known that I did not agree with the change.  However, like so many matters, one has to see it in the round.  The plight of the banks and the prospect of the losing significant savings to the post office because of a perceived superior interest rate could have potentially added to the difficulties the banks have rectifying their own internal ratios.  It has been a big success for the post office.  The decision was made by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which reports directly to the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, it is a matter for him.<\/p><p>It also shows there is still a few bob in the country.  It would be marvellous if our citizens would take some of that few bob out of the post office and spend it on the high street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400017#Q00300","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An Bille um an Dara Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Deireadh a Chur le Seanad &Eacute;ireann) 2013: An Dara C&eacute;im (At&oacute;g&aacute;il): An Dara C&eacute;im (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013: Second Stage (Resumed): Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1372938900,"counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400019#S00175"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372938900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Thairg an tairiscint seo ar D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, 26 Meitheamh 2013:<\/p><p>Go l&eacute;ifear an Bill an Dara hUair anois.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372938900,"counter":182,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved on Wednesday, 26 June 2013:<\/p><p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372938900,"counter":183,"content":"<p>At&oacute;gadh an D&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar leas&uacute; a 1:\r\n  Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:To delete all words after ''That'' and substitute the following:\r\n&quot;the Bill be read a second time on 17 September, 2013, for the following reasons:\r\n(i) to request the Constitutional Convention to consider the constitutional role of the Seanad and to allow time for such consideration;\r\n(ii) to facilitate a consultation process with the Nominating Bodies and the Nominating Universities who have for more than 75 years fulfilled the constitutional role for Seanad General Elections as required by Article 18 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann;\r\n(iii) to allow other interested parties to make submissions; and\r\n(iv) to have the views arising from these consultations and discussions available to the people as they prepare to vote in the Referendum.&quot;\r\n   - (Senator Feargal Quinn).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372938900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

A figure of &euro;21 million has been knocked around but salaries for the Seanad come to &euro;6 million while Seanad staff will be redeployed.

There is a belief that Senators just drink tea for all three days of sittings; that is not true either.<\/p><p>I have no problem voting for the legislation.  However, I will not be canvassing for it.  For the first time, I will declare how I will vote before I enter the polling booth - I will be voting not to abolish the Seanad.  I am in favour of the bicameral system.  No one can tell me the D&aacute;il is any worse than the Seanad.  I have had plenty of experience of politics for the past 19 years.  The role of the Seanad should have been referred to the Convention on the Constitution if we are to be honest in the way we are doing business.<\/p><p>There is a notion that no one in the Seanad said &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; when it came to the economic crash.  I said it clearly on Clare FM between 2007 and 2009 and when I was mayor of Clare.  I could see where the problems were coming up.  During that time, I questioned the transfer of &euro;7.8 billion from Irish Life and Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank to bulk up balance sheets in September only to hand it back in November.  I will not be lumped into that claim that no one called for a stop.<\/p><p>In my two years as a Senator, I have been able to build up relationships with Ministers.  While I may not contribute very often in the Chamber, I certainly work here.  I have been involved in getting the International Air Transport Association, IATA, to hold various meetings in Ireland comprising 2,500 representatives from all the airlines.  This will allow us access to these people and will assist in developing our overall airline maintenance and composite, as well as tourism, industries.  The value of these visits will be approximately &euro;15 million which does not include the added value business that comes after that.<\/p><p>Developments at Shannon Airport happened a lot quicker because I was in the Seanad.  I believed we needed one management body for the airport and industrial estate.  I have no doubt the airport will now go from strength to strength.<\/p><p>I am also working on two major biomass plants to the value of &euro;180 million, &euro;90 million in Sligo and &euro;90 million in Shannon.  It is important we put our personal inputs on the record.  No one outside this House has the right to throw around statements like the Seanad is useless and they do nothing.  I heard a Labour Deputy claim the Seanad is rotten, an appalling statement.

Measaim go bhfuil bot&uacute;n m&oacute;r &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an Rialtas sa mh&eacute;id sin.  Caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; sin a r&aacute;.  I have listened to much of the debate both here and in the D&aacute;il on this Bill which proposes the abolition of the Seanad.  As a former Member of the Seanad, the Minister of State will be aware that many of the politicians currently serving in the D&aacute;il cut their political teeth in this House.  Some Deputies spent a period in this House after they had lost their seats in the other House.<\/p><p>Democracy is wonderful.  It gives the people an opportunity to have their say.  The 1937 Constitution provides for a bicameral system of parliamentary democracy in this country, with two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Martin Luther King once said, &quot;Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.&quot;  Before the last general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party went before the electorate and promised a new form of democracy that would be closer to the people.  The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, said the people would have their say and that their representatives would represent them effectively and properly.  We have since seen a change in the way the democratic institutions of the State are operating.  Irrespective of the promises made, more people have been appointed to State agencies and the boards of semi-State organisations, etc., during the short lifetime of the Government than during the term of the previous Administration.<\/p><p>The real crux of the issue is the attack on democracy happening under the Government's watch.  The proposal to abolish town councils is an attack on democracy at its lowest level because town councillors are the closest public representatives to the people.  The town of Letterkenny in my constituency has flourished under a thriving town council, the abolition of which will be proposed under legislation that will be brought before this House later in the year.  The Government blocked the holding of an election to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, of which I am a former member.  Bh&iacute; deis ag muintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid v&oacute;ta&iacute; a chaitheamh agus daoine a thoghadh ar an mbord.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; i bhf&aacute;bhar an chinnidh a ghlac an Rialtais l&iacute;on na gcomhalta&iacute; ar an mbord a laghd&uacute; &oacute; 20 go 12.  I had no difficulty with the proposal to reduce the size of the board from 20 to 12.  While I supported the decision made by the Government in that instance, I felt its decision to remove the vote from people who live in Gaeltacht areas was an absolute attack on democracy.  Now that the members of the board are appointed by the Government, the board consists entirely of members of Fine Gael or the Labour Party who were appointed under the Government's watch.  That does not represent democracy - it represents the creation of another quango by the Government.  That is not what was promised before the 2011 general election.<\/p><p>The proposal to provide for the abolition of the Seanad was made before the last general election.  In 2009, during the MacGill summer school in my constituency, the then Leader of the Opposition and current Taoiseach issued a statement saying he envisaged that a reformed Seanad, playing a greater role in Irish society, would be the best option for the people.  At a Fine Gael dinner or gig later that year, he engaged in a finger-licking exercise to see which way the wind was blowing.  Politicians are sometimes accused of doing this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400020#T00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1372939500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>There are no gigs in the Burlington Hotel, rather there are dinners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400020#T00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372939500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>On his way into the Burlington Hotel that night the current Taoiseach licked his finger to see which way the wind was blowing.  Rather than doing what he had promised to do a few months earlier, he decided to do the popular thing in line with how the wind was blowing that night.  Much to the shock of his own parliamentary party - his own Senators were certainly shocked - he announced that Fine Gael would abolish the Seanad if it were in government.  A few months previously he had spoken about the need to reform the Seanad to make it work better for the people, but in the Burlington Hotel he instead announced the proposed abolition of the democratic institution of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>We all recognise that this House has its flaws.  Gandhi once said, &quot;The spirit of democracy is not a mechanical thing to be adjusted by abolition of forms [but] requires change of heart.&quot;  Clearly, the Taoiseach has not had a change of heart since 2009, when he decided that the abolition of democracy was the answer.  He is giving the people an opportunity to vote on the issue in a referendum, which is due to take place some time in October.  I appeal to the Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators who are saying they will vote for the Bill but will oppose the proposal in the referendum to stand up and be counted and say they are not prepared to support this legislation unless the people are given an opportunity to vote for the reform of this institution.  The people should be given a proper choice between abolishing the Seanad, reforming it or keeping it as it is.  Having spoken to many people about this matter, I believe the people would vote for reform.  We live in a very dangerous Ireland because we have a Government that is controlled by four or five people.

Great debates have taken place in this House.  During the Minister of State's time here great debates took place.  We could reform this House to be an institution that could be reforming, reflective and scrutinise legislation, particularly that coming from the European Union.  Only 2% of the European laws that affect this country are scrutinised by the Oireachtas.  That means that 98% of all the laws made in Europe that affect this country are not scrutinised by the Oireachtas.  We do not even need a referendum or legislation to scrutinise those laws, all we need is to change the order under which the Seanad does its business.<\/p><p>We can make this Chamber a reforming Chamber, one that works more effectively for the people.  We can give everyone in the country a vote to elect people into this Chamber.  I would support that, whether it was done on a European Parliament constituency basis or some other way.  Let us give the people the option to decide what they want and not just go black and white, yes or no because if there was a referendum in the morning to abolish or keep D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann who is to know what way people would vote?  Maybe the D&aacute;il should be abolished and not the Seanad.  Has the Taoiseach reflected on that idea?  If he really wants to save money why not keep this Chamber and get rid of the other Chamber, which costs almost ten times more than this House?  If the Taoiseach is serious about saving money then he would simply decide to get rid of the D&aacute;il and have the people directly elect Senators into this House and they would form the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940100,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The Senator has spent too much time in Cairo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940100,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Shades of Cairo alright.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940100,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Like every Senator I am going to vote against the Seanad's abolition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01600","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940100,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940100,"counter":207,"content":"<p>That is obvious.  It would be utterly hypocritical of anybody to sit in this House and draw a salary and believe that it should be abolished.  There are many positive aspects to the House and a great deal of very positive work is done here.  All Senators, of all parties, make very valuable contributions but we must look at the big picture.  For the first time in the existence of this House it will be to the fore in political debate and discourse for a few months.  I support the holding of a referendum.  It is the correct decision.  The Taoiseach made a commitment to hold a referendum on abolition.  Many people here will not like to hear this but most people in the country do not believe that the Seanad is working and do not believe that in its present form it should continue.  I happen to be one of those.  I believe that a reformed Seanad is important and will play a useful role into the future.  If the people do opt to retain the Seanad it will be with a strict caveat that we have fundamental reform.<\/p><p>Many have asked why reform is not being put to the people in the referendum.  There is no provision within our Constitution for a preferendum.  The Constitution provides for a referendum with a yes or no option.  I hope that the people will opt to retain the Seanad.  If they do, it will be very clearly with the obligation on a future Government to reform it.  If the people opt to retain this House, within the present Government and its programme for Government there will not be the opportunity for reform.  In future election manifestos and in a future programme for Government I suspect that Seanad reform will be one of the top priorities.  It has probably gone too far to be reformed.  There have been ten or 11 reports on Seanad reform.  I understand that when Mary O'Rourke was Leader of the House and the Minister of State was Leader of the Opposition they worked very hard on a report that was widely acknowledged to be very good.  It was a shame and a pity that the previous Government did not move towards implementing that report.  The referendum will probably be the best thing that has ever happened to this House because it will be endorsed by the people.  I do not think that the people are going to abolish this House.<\/p><p>On a personal level I consider it a great privilege to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and it gives my community an opportunity to have a representative in the Oireachtas.  It gives County Clare an extra two national representatives.  With Senator Mulcahy and me, instead of there being four Oireachtas Members from Clare, the four Deputies, there are six.  The county can see the results.  In my area as a result of my work in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, speaking to Ministers and so forth several projects have got the go-ahead.  In the past few months we have seen the results of that in north Clare, where some vital infrastructural projects such as the Doolin coastguard have got the go-ahead, some years in advance of the community's expectation which was that it would go ahead in 2016.  Thankfully, the project will be finished and put to bed by the end of this year.<\/p><p>We have made inputs about aviation policy with Shannon Airport and the new independent structure and there was an announcement yesterday of direct flights between Shannon and New York and Shannon and Boston all year round.  As Oireachtas Members all six of us from Clare have worked extremely hard together to put forward the case for Shannon Airport which has worked in our favour and in favour of the country.  There are initiatives such as the Gathering.  The fact that there are two Senators in Clare, along with the four Deputies, helps tourism figures.<\/p><p>I hope that my being a Member of the House with a disability and the first Member of the Oireachtas with the disability that I have has created a precedent for others.  After a recent television appearance I received several letters and e-mails from teenagers with significant disabilities saying that they now believe that a career in politics is possible for them.  That would not have happened if the Seanad did not exist.<\/p><p>The initial purpose of the Seanad was to reflect, and give a voice to, minorities.  The 42 new Senators here reflect a vast array of minorities, for example Senator Van Turnhout with her expertise in the area of children's rights has influenced and helped to shape Government policy.  History will decide that the Government has done phenomenal work for children and Senator van Turnhout's amendments will enable her to claim justifiable credit for that type of work.<\/p> <p>Senator van Turnhout, through her role in this House and through the amendments that she has put forward, certainly will be able to claim justifiable credit for that type of work.  I look at what Senator Fiach Mac Conghail has done in terms of the arts, what Senator Eamonn Coghlan has done in the area of sport, what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has done in the area of small business, and many more.  We are fortunate here in this House to have such an array of talent, not only on the Independent benches but in the main political parties as well.  This House provides a wonderful forum for discourse and debate that does not happen in the other House.  The 60 Senators here punch way above their weight as compared to the 166 TDs.  If due diligence was done on the contribution and ability of the Seanad in terms of numbers as compared to the D&aacute;il, one would be surprised at the results.  Often we have debates here on the economy and finance and I regularly take great pleasure in listening to Senator Sean D. Barrett, probably one of the country's best economists.  We have his expertise in this House available to the Government free of charge.  That is something that really needs to be acknowledged.<\/p><p>The people will ultimately decide whether we need a Seanad or not.  I would suggest that comparing Ireland to other countries is not particularly relevant because few countries use the proportional representation single transferable vote, PR-STV, system of voting.  The only other country that has a PR-STV style of election is Malta.  With PR-STV, there are competitive adversarial multi-seat constituencies.  Countries that have a single parliament do not have that type of electoral system and their MPs can focus all of their resources and time on national politics and legislation.  In this country, that is not the case.  If one wants real political reform, one must start with the electoral system.  One cannot really suggest having a single House with a PR-STV electoral system, particularly with the multi-seat structure that we have in this country, because invariably there will be TDs who should be concentrating on national politics but are really focused on self-preservation, getting themselves re-elected and dealing with local issues.  As long as we have that type of system, we need a House of Parliament such as the Seanad which will represent interest groups and expertise in various areas.<\/p><p>The Irish people are a discerning electorate.  They will see this as being a small short-term gain but in terms of the long-term strategic benefit of Ireland, they will vote to retain the Seanad.  I want to send a clear message to the Government.  If the people vote to retain the Seanad, there will be a clear requirement for a future Government to introduce reform, and I suggest starting with the report of the former Leader, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400021#U01800","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372940700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brian Hayes, back to the bosom of his political life.<\/p><p>When introducing this Bill, the Taoiseach stated that there were too many politicians in this country and his remedy to this terrible malaise was to abolish, abolish, abolish.  The Government has taken a wrecking ball to the sum of our democracy.  Town councils, for instance, are being done away with altogether.  They are being wiped off the map.  City and county councils are being amalgamated.  My own county of Limerick has a modest political representation of 45 councillors and now, with both local authorities combined, is losing five.  We will be down to 40.<\/p><p>What we have now is a personal solo-run against this Chamber.  I played in a junior B county final on Tuesday night last and there are not many lads who would go on personal solo-runs in those circumstances.  The Taoiseach may end up on the flat of his back after this particular solo-run.  I wonder from where this crusade has come.  When the Taoiseach came into this House as a chap a long time ago, maybe a Senator told a Mayo joke that he took up the wrong way - I do not want the Cathaoirleach to be offended.<\/p><p>It is amazing that the Taoiseach, the longest serving Member of the Oireachtas, has been here nearly 40 years and suddenly this light switch has gone off in his head.  He had his St. Paul on the road to Damascus moment just as he was about to give his address to the Fine Gael presidential dinner.  I often wonder whether the few glasses of Merlot he had with the dinner did not agree with him fully.  He came up with this gem of wisdom that, as he was not getting the attention anymore and the spotlight had been taken off him, he would shout, roar and scream his head off until he got the desperately needed headlines that he deserved, and he would call for the abolition of the Seanad.  After 40 years here, it suddenly dawns on him that the Seanad was the problem all along and he wants to hang the Seanad out to dry.  It was always a bonkers proposal.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach was on the record the previous summer at the MacGill Summer School in Donegal - maybe there is something in the air in Donegal - stating that Seanad should be reformed.  He spoke of how fantastic a contribution a reformed Seanad could make to democracy in Ireland, but then, all of a shot, he changed his mind.  It is becoming somewhat of a feature that leaders and members of this Government can change their minds at the drop of the hat.  They say one thing and then turn around and do the other.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach, when he proposed this Bill, compared this country to Finland.  In fairness, Finland has a similar population to Ireland.  I studied in Finland for a while.  Finland has an elected politician for every 550 people.  It has a fantastic devolved system of local government that has real powers, and it works.  Here, we have a politician for every 2,476 people, including local and national representation, but when the Taoiseach is finished with these fantastic reforms that he promises, there will be one politician for every 4,144 people.  It does not add up.<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention was an admirable notion.  Fair play to the Government for taking the initiative.  The Constitutional Convention was set up by the Government to debate the Constitution but it has become an utter farce.  The Constitutional Convention, made up of fantastic persons such as Senator Bacik, can debate changing the voting age from 18 to 16 years, yet it cannot debate the future of this Chamber-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400022#V00200","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940700,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400022#V00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1372940700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>-----which is one arm of the Oireachtas equal to the D&aacute;il and the Presidency.

I stood for election and canvassed on behalf of the Fine Gael Party during the last general election.  Its manifesto contained a commitment that the matter would be put to the people in a referendum.  The same commitment was stated in the manifesto of the Labour Party and the Senator was a candidate for that party.  The referendum was also mentioned in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach made that point clear when he was in the House last week.  The matter was not referred to the Constitutional Convention because we did not want to sidestep the question but wanted to put it straight to the people.<\/p><p>I have listened to many of the contributions and read some of them.  It is clear that most people who have contributed to the debate recognise that the Seanad cannot continue as it is and needs to be changed.  A question has hung over it for a long time and, as we all know, numerous reports have recommended changes.  The reports were worthwhile and should have been considered, but this and previous Governments did not do anything about them.  <\/p><p>This Seanad differs from others because we have invited many speakers to attend such as Mrs. Mary Robinson and, recently, Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Other speakers have made worthwhile contributions to the debate.  The attendance of Irish MEPs here in recent months has been a constructive and worthwhile exercise.  The Government has also been requested to allow the Seanad to consider EU legislation.  That would be an invaluable use of the Chamber and the request still stands.  Since the Lisbon treaty, the Parliament has been granted more powers and functions, which means that we must supervise and scrutinise EU legislation.  The committees carry out this task, but EU legislation still does not receive enough attention.  The Seanad could play a valuable role in scrutinising such legislation. <\/p><p>I have been a member of local authorities and the D&aacute;il and I am now a Member of this House.  The problem with the Seanad is that it is a mini-D&aacute;il and has a Government majority which allows for legislation to be voted through.  A criticism of both Houses is that the hierarchy has the power and the numbers to pass legislation.  The same criticism can be levelled at Irish politics in general.  Members of Parliament, be they in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, really do not have an opportunity to contribute as much as they would like because power is centralised and lies with the Executive, the 15 members of the Cabinet.  &quot;Power&quot; is a strong word and needs to be used to emphasise and describe the situation in this instance.  As somebody said, this House and the committees are about ideas, information and bringing forward issues that would not necessarily receive the same attention as in the D&aacute;il.  That is the history in this House.  <\/p><p>We need to change politics.  We need to change the way we operate right across the board.  I would like to see stronger regional authorities and assume that many Members of both Houses would be interested in serving on them.  I look forward to seeing how the changes introduced at local authority level will manifest next year and hope councillors will step up to the mark.  I am sure that they will, if they are given further powers.  Like many Senators, I travelled the country during my Seanad campaign and gained a wonderful insight into the strength of councillors.  I have met people who serve their local community and make decisions on a regular basis for their local community, town and the area in which they reside.  I greatly admire local authority members and the valuable role they play is not appreciated enough.  This House provides a connection to local authority members by way of their nominating Senators.  That is the one say they have.  Some of us are better than others at communicating with them and it is important that they communicate with us.  <\/p><p>I have examined the various options proposed for Seanad reform and view it as a weakness that Senators are not directly elected by the people and do not receive a direct mandate from them.  I am concerned that if they were directly elected, it would be done on party lines and party politics would infiltrate the House again.  I have listened to the contributions here on reform and do not think that is what people want.<\/p><p>Reform should also mean that we reduce the number of Deputies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has told us that he cannot reduce the numbers in the D&aacute;il as he is prevented from doing so by the provisions of the Constitution.  The referendum is expected to take place in October.  If we are serious about reform, why not include a question on the ballot paper a question on whether to reduce the number of Deputies?  If we were to do so, we could then prove that we had introduced real reform the next time the political parties faced a general election.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach has spoken about committees and announced that he will establish new ones, but I have not seen the details.  The current committee system can be and has been good.  We can point to very fine examples such as the health committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Jerry Buttimer and the hearings it has undertaken.  That is an excellent example of how a committee can work.  The Committee of Public Accounts also meets on a weekly basis and commands respect, particularly for the DIRT Inquiry.  I hope a banking inquiry will be established.  However, the regular committees do not seem to have taken off as originally envisaged and we should take the opportunity to strengthen them.  Committees will break down along party lines and any question tabled will be voted on in the way the Government wishes.  <\/p><p>I have been a Member of the House for a number of years and know that the Independent Senators have played a valuable role in previous Seanads.  They continue to play a valuable role in this Seanad.  <\/p><p>I have received an email from my cousin who lives in Qatar.  He has asked me not to support the proposal to abolish the Seanad because it is the only opportunity he has to have a say.  I thought he did not have a vote, but as a graduate of the National University of Ireland, he can vote in Seanad elections.  He has made the valid point that he values that vote.<\/p> <p>Of course, not everyone is a graduate of our universities.  The university Senators play a very valuable role and connect with emigrants.  This man says he is living in Qatar and I have two sons who are away.  The one who lives in Boston listens to RTE and Newstalk throughout the day and reads <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>online.  My son in Chicago recently got up at 5 a.m. to watch a Lions match.  Emigrants may be abroad, but they are working to get back here and maintaining their connections.  They have Skype and come home as often as they can.  Those who are fortunate enough to have a qualification from our universities have a say in the election of six Members.  If we could expand the franchise further, it would be an opportunity to include the emigrant voice.  The prospect of giving the vote to emigrants in presidential elections was raised, but that would not be enough.  While the details of any condition can be ironed out, including an obligation to hold an Irish passport and time limits after which a person living abroad could no longer vote, the concept is very worthwhile.<\/p><p> I will support the Bill today.  We should put the matter to the people whose House this is.  I look forward to the public debate.  If the question were put now, people would vote to abolish the Seanad.  The campaign will be important and provide a focus to articulate the way the House operates and its potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400023#W00200","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372941900,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  It is ironic given that he participated in producing a very good report by a committee chaired by Mary O'Rourke and attended by Joe O'Toole and John Dardis, that he should be the here.

He participated as a Senator in the preparation of what was a reform report and put his name to it.<\/p><p>  &quot;For my part, I will resist to the last gasp of my existence and the last drop of my blood.  And when I feel the hour of my disolution growing, I will, like the father of Hannibal, take my children to the altar and swear them to eternal hostility against the invaders of their country's freedom.&quot;  I did not say this, rather it was said by William Plunkett, MP, against Lord Castlereagh and the Imperial British Government.  On 22 January 1799 the Irish Parliament had its first opportunity to express an opinion on the British Government's proposal to unite Great Britain and Ireland under one Parliament in Westminster.  The debate lasted for 21 uninterrupted hours, during which 80 MPs addressed the House.  We have been given a paltry eight hours to do justice to the proposed abolition of the Seanad.  The patriot orator, Henry Grattan, whose Parliament was called the Grattan Parliament, also spoke.  I have some recollection of publishing a related stamp on behalf of the philatelic section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1982.  I launched it here but never thought I would be back in the House to talk about Henry Grattan who purchased a seat in the Irish House of Commons, which cost him &pound;1,200.  He had been a Member previously but had left Parliament.  He rode overnight to Dublin and the House of Commons where the Bank of Ireland is located now.  He spoke for two hours and was seated, as he was not well.  He charged the Government with bribery and deceit and, waving his finger at Lord Castlereagh, stated:<blockquote>The thing which he proposes to buy is what cannot be sold - liberty.  He proposes to you to substitute the British Parliament in your place [...]  Against such a body, were I expiring on the floor, I should beg to utter my last breath and record my dying testimony.<\/blockquote>That is our great orator and patriot.  The betrayal culminated in a poem which was soon taught in every Irish school.<blockquote>How did they pass the union?  By perjury and fraud;<br \/>By slaves who sold their land for gold,<br \/>As Judas sold his God.<\/blockquote>It is not too dissimilar to the proposal before the House.<\/p><p>  The Constitution was voted for in 1937.  My parents voted for it and never expected that I would be here.  They voted for it because it was right and they voted with the majority.  It has served the people extraordinarily well during the years.  They have held it against the Blueshirts and the fascists.  It has been good to Ireland and should be held, honoured and preserved now.  As far as I know, I am the longest serving Member of the Oireachtas in the House.  The Taoiseach and I are the only Members of the Oireachtas who voted for a Taoiseach in 1977.  I voted for Jack Lynch and the Taoiseach voted for Liam Cosgrave.  Before I was elected to the Seanad in 2002, I had enormous respect for the House.  As a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, I brought numerous Bills to the House and accepted from it many worthwhile amendments.  I sat where the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is sitting and received the greatest advice from Senators who included Mary Robinson and Pat Kennedy from Limerick who was an expert on law.  We brought the Companies Act through the House.  I will not go through the litany of Bills.  I did not come to the House disrespectfully on my election.  I fought elections in 1992, 1997 and, successfully, in 2002.  I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1977 on the first occasion on which I stood.  I record these matters as a context for my respect for the House.  It is not that I am trying to preserve something for the future, rather it is something I believe.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach said we should abolish the Seanad because we had too many politicians.  This is the only commitment he gave in the 2011 election which he hopes to honour.  He promised in Roscommon town that he would retain its 24\/7 accident and emergency service.  He broke that promise and the accident and emergency unit is now closed.  He said he would not legislate for abortion, but he is now legalising it.  He said he would reduce the D&aacute;il by 20 Members, but it is to be reduced by only eight.  He has refused to put that proposal in a referendum on the same day as the proposal to abolish the Seanad to see if he would achieve it.  Possibly, he would.  The only promise he has honoured is his proposal to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the case he makes is not sustainable.  When one takes account of both local and national representation, Ireland has far fewer elected politicians <i>per capita<\/i> than other countries.  The Taoiseach provided the example of Finland to back up his assertions.  It has a similar population, at just over 5 million.  Currently, it has five times more elected politicians than Ireland.  If the Government succeeds in its proposal to abolish the Seanad, we will have one eighth of the number of politicians in Finland which is a very successful country.<\/p><p>  The Government is being disingenuous when it argues to advance the cause of Seanad abolition that we have too many politicians.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, have acquiesced to an increase in the number of local authority seats in Dublin to protect Labour Party councillors from the wrath of the electorate next year.  That is a fact and a very cynical exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400024#X00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1372941900,"counter":216,"content":"<p>That is a political interpretation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400024#X00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1372941900,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Putting Labour first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400024#X00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1372941900,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Senator Terry Leyden to continue, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400024#X00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1372941900,"counter":219,"content":"<p>It is a fact.

As the Accounting Officer of the Oireachtas, Mr. Coughlan publicly testified in January 2012 that the gross annual saving from the abolition of the Vote of the Oireachtas will be less than &euro;10 million.  The net savings will be very much less if we take into account the fact that 30% of it goes back to the Exchequer in taxes, levies and VAT.  The real annual cost of the Seanad is probably in the region of &euro;6 million, compared to an annual &euro;28 million for councillors in pay and allowances.<\/p><p> I am appalled by the proposals to abolish a House of such quality, which such quality contributors.  I find it extraordinarily insulting to those who went before him as holders of the office of Taoiseach.  Returning to my earlier remarks on Henry Grattan, another point was made in this contribution:<blockquote>Some MPs were raised to the peerage or promoted, for example from a baronage to an earldom.  In a few cases direct money bribes were made.  The viceroy wrote in despair: &quot;My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people&quot;.<\/blockquote>I heard Senator David Norris lecturing me this morning and I am sorry it was not recorded because it was very impressive.  He said that we should not sell out the Seanad, that we should stand firm and oppose the abolition and that we would be doing all a favour.  It reminds me that the people who were against the removal now find themselves in more elevated positions and are in a position to say that the Seanad should be abolished.  An example is the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who led the Opposition party in this House and is now in Cabinet.  None of them stood by the House because the Taoiseach felt, for political reasons, it was to his advantage.  I will not be beaten.  I regard the referendum on the Seanad as a referendum on abortion and a referendum on this Government and I will therefore ask the people to vote &quot;No&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, and &quot;No&quot; again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400024#X00900","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372942500,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I find it bizarre that we are debating the abolition of the Seanad.  Which one of us will say that we should not be here?  None of us will do so because, if we believe it, the door is there and we should walk out.  Every Member believes he or she is doing a good job and should be here.<\/p><p>When I was a member of Kerry County Council, we could not debate a motion where we had a conflict of interest.  We had to leave the council chamber yet here we are, 60 Members debating a referendum in which we all have a conflict of interest.  However, a commitment has been given to the people of Ireland that a referendum will be held.  I will honour the commitment and I will support the motion to hold a referendum.  The people, in their wisdom, will make the final decision.<\/p><p>Much of the debate in recent months has centred on the idea that the House is full of failed D&aacute;il candidates and would-be Deputies.  Perhaps there is some truth in that but as someone who aspires to represent the people of my county in public office, I make no apology to anyone seeking election to this House, as I did in 2011.  It is perfectly legitimate that someone who has narrowly missed out on a seat in the D&aacute;il seeks election to our second Chamber, not as the second-best option but as an attempt to bring experience and ability to bear in our national Parliament.  People who have contested the general election bring with them the experience of the most recent general election campaign and of being a candidate who has spent months talking to, and listen to the views of, the voters.  These views can be brought more easily to the floor of this House than the D&aacute;il.  <\/p><p>There is also an impression in certain quarters that Senators are part-time politicians.  I cannot speak for others in the House but I am anything but a part-time politician.  I gave up my employment to take this job and devote myself to politics full-time.  If I am not mistaken, I am the only Senator from Kerry who maintains a full-time office outside Leinster House.  I also hold weekly clinics all over south Kerry, where I meet my constituents, address their concerns, hear what they say and advocate on their behalf.  This influences the contributions I make in this House.  When in Leinster House, I devote my energies to my legislative duties and when I am in my constituency, I provide my constituents with a service that is as good as any Deputy.<\/p><p>Members remember the late Michael Moynihan from Kerry South.  He contested general election after general election for many years and finally made it into the Seanad, before becoming a Member of the Lower House and a Minister of State.  The late Michael Moynihan was one of the best public representatives Kerry South ever had.  I put my hand on my heart and say that.<\/p><p>President Michael D. Higgins went through the Seanad, on to the D&aacute;il and became President.  President Obama went through Congress and the Senate to become President.  I cannot see anything wrong with people seeking election to this House.  Although we do not get elected by the members of the public, we get elected by people elected by the public.  We bring forward their views.<\/p><p>A notion put forward by those who do not believe the Seanad is worth retaining is that the House has moved a long way from what &Eacute;amon de Valera envisaged in the Constitution of 1937 and what it was intended to achieve in the period after the foundation of the State.  The aim, in part, was to bring together diverse voices from a variety of sectors and vocations to offer an input into political debate.  In many ways, it achieved that objective for many years.  Like everything else, institutions evolve and the Seanad has moved away from being the preserve of sectoral interests and has in many ways become a more democratic institution.<\/p><p>We still debate the many issues that hardly ever get a mention on the floor of the D&aacute;il, including equality issues, international issues and minority issues.  I recently moved a motion on the issue of domestic violence on behalf of my Labour colleagues.  It is a topic rarely discussed in the D&aacute;il and I urged that domestic violence be included on our Statute Book as a specific criminal offence.  I have tabled an amendment with regard to deposit retention to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  It will be accepted by the Minister and I am also working on a Bill to bring to the Seanad.<\/p><p>There is need for reform and successive governments have failed to take reform seriously.  However, we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  If we look closely at the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, there is not much difference except in how we are elected.  The Whip system is the same, time constraints are the same and turns to speak are the same, etc.  It has been reiterated by speakers in this debate that legislation comes out of the D&aacute;il and needs to be amended in this House.  If they do not want us, why does legislation come out of the Lower House in that state?  Why are amendments not made before it leaves the House?  What will change when we are gone?  Will fewer public representatives in the Lower House be able to handle the extra work?  If so, why are they not doing it now?  What will be the difference?<\/p><p>I have already said that I run a full-time office outside Leinster House.  We cannot claim expenses for the office, telephone calls, heating or insurance.  I pay for it out of my Seanad salary.  If the Taoiseach is serious about saving money, why can Deputies not receive a cut in pay to the same amount as Senators and provide for their offices out of that?<\/p> <p>I am doing that and if I can do that, they can.  They have two assistants working for them: a parliamentary assistant and a secretary.  I have one and I still provide the same service.  There would be additional savings if the 158 Deputies in the next D&aacute;il had their pay cut to the same level as a Senator.  We would not even have to abolish the House to make savings in that case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400025#Y00400","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372943100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

It should not be forgotten that Fine Gael supported the bank guarantee at the time.<\/p><p>All that pales into insignificance compared with the arrogance of pulling the proposal for Seanad abolition like a rabbit out of a hat.  The Taoiseach must have had a bad night's sleep in Mayo before waking up in the morning and having to come up with something.  This is what he came up with.  He did not discuss Seanad abolition with anyone nor did he consult anyone.  It was a fantastic soundbite at a time when he was under pressure from his own backbenchers.  Who will ever forget the look of shock on poor Senator Frances Fitzgerald's face, the leader of the Fine Gael group in the House at the time, as she looked on at her party leader announcing on live television that he would abolish the House without even consulting her?  To describe it as ungallant and graceless is as understatement.  It was a poor show.<\/p><p>The de Valera Constitution was passed by the people.  It was an exceptional document by any standards and for all its flaws, it has stood the test of time.  From time to time naturally, with society evolving as it does, particularly since our accession to the European Union, we have had to amend it, but no previous Taoiseach or Government countenanced the notion of putting a referendum such as this on a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; basis to the people.  This involves taking out one third of the entire Oireachtas and ripping the heart out of the 1937 Constitution.  Is there a subliminal anti-de Valera thought in the Taoiseach's head?  Who knows?  Between that and the rogue gene, he has got it all wrong anyway.<\/p><p>The people are not being well served by having this question put to them.  We are all democrats and I believe the more democracy there is, the better.  Is it fair to the people to present such a question on a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; basis?  There is no simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer and we all realise that.  I will vote against this proposal not because I am anti-democratic or anti the people but because the people need to be protected.  If this behaviour catches on, a future Taoiseach could decide to do something crazy as well and go to the people with it.  Checks and balances must be in place before one goes to the people on a subject of this enormity.  How many articles of the Constitution are affected?  It is not fair to the people that such a referendum should be put to them when no earthly attempt has been made to reform the House in the meantime.  Every Member realises the House needs reform.  All the proposals to do so have come from the Seanad and they were all blocked in the Lower House, including by a Government led by Deputy Enda Kenny.  He refused to entertain reform proposals and to come to the House to debate them with us, but then he said the Seanad was no longer fit for purpose and it should be abolished.  It is good that he is not into horse racing because if he was, we would have a horse in the Oireachtas with a ministerial title just like when Caligula put his own horse in the Roman Senate long ago.  This proposal smacks of the same effrontery and craziness.<\/p><p>I am not an expert on the bicameral system of government but having studied politics all my life, I believe it is the best system and it works well.  The Seanad takes a significant workload from the Lower House.  Bills are initiated here and it makes it easier for the D&aacute;il to go through them afterwards.  An enhanced committee system would not do a better job on legislation than we do.  Senator Terry Brennan made that point well yesterday.  Committees are structured differently from the House.  An unelected Star Chamber appointed by the Taoiseach would certainly not be better than the Seanad.  The Taoiseach had talked about this for a while but he has been silenced on it.  The proposal that the Taoiseach of the day would fill this room with his own appointees with special skills or experience instead of the Seanad represents a diminution of democracy.<\/p> <p> Another old canard that has not been tackled and is a favourite with the media is that the Seanad is a stepping stone for those with political ambition or a retirement home for defeated Members of the Lower House.  I believe that any young man or woman who aspires to go into politics should start at the bottom, in what W.B. Yeats described as the &quot;rag and bone shop of the heart&quot;.  They should get their experience serving on the town council, then the county council and if they are lucky enough to get a seat in the Seanad they will be highly equipped from what they learn in a short time to go to the other House and into the higher echelons of Government and become Taoiseach.  I think that is a valid aspiration.<\/p><p> When a Deputy loses his seat, his choice is to retire or try to stay in politics.  His wisdom and experience will be valid and useful in any Chamber.  That is a legitimate aspiration.<\/p><p> We do not want the Seanad to become a second D&aacute;il Chamber.  We want something different.  The main reform is that everybody can vote in a Seanad election.  Under the current structure, the Taoiseach can appoint 11 members.  All the Taoiseach's nominees need is one vote from the Taoiseach, but I am not underestimating them because the reason they got that vote from the Taoiseach of the day is because they had given a significant contribution to the community, were outstanding in the fields of social work, the arts, business, farming and so on.  They earned that vote.<\/p><p> Six graduates are elected by the University Panel.  I would not stand for that election even if it got me into heaven because they face the battle of finding the electorate, establishing where they live and getting them to register as electors, then they must get sufficient votes to be elected.  My colleagues and I, the 43 Members that are elected by the county councils, have been elected by a system that only de Valera could have devised.  It is electoral torture.  One has to go around the country meeting all the county councillors and one will not be successful if one lands on the day with a smile on the face or a silk tie in one's hand.  Members must be in touch with councillors way before that and for the duration of the five years in office because, if not, they will be forgotten about for the next election.  Members must learn about local problems.  As Senator Moloney said one learns from councillors the problems of the people they represent.  We are a legitimate democratic conduit of opinion from the people, through the councillors up to the Seanad.  Let me say that county councillors are no fools and they will not elect a fool.  There are a great many of us but we are not fools.  <\/p><p> It is easy to write a smart letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>denigrating politicians at large and we are the target at present.  One can go on the &quot;Joe Duffy Show&quot; and have a great rant.  How many of these people would go through the system of election that either a Deputy or a Senator has to endure?  How many of them would go for it and how many would be elected?<\/p><p> I oppose this Bill because I think it is unfair to the people.  It is badly thought out.  It will create a terrible precedent that a Taoiseach can pluck an issue and put it to the people.  If the people are asked to vote in a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, I will fight it tooth and nail.  I would be very surprised if my colleagues on all sides do not have enough pride in themselves and in the position they hold and won hard to go out and defeat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400026#Z01700","speaker":"1142","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372943700,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about Fine Gael arrogance.

Nevertheless, in the opinion of many the Seanad does not have a unique selling point at the moment as the argument is made that there is nothing done in the Seanad that could not be done by other means, such as an enhanced D&aacute;il committee system.  In addition, the Seanad is seen by many, as my colleague stated, as a waiting room for the D&aacute;il or a retirement home for former members and others.  That this is a perversion and not its original function is sad and regrettable and it is not true, as the original vocational function of the Seanad has been replaced by a rigid party political system with the accompanying Whip system.  It was not the present or the previous Government that did that.  That happened within three years of 1937 so we are dealing with an historic legacy.  Therefore, those who would favour reform rather than abolition have their work cut out in persuading the people that this is the correct road to take.  As an aside, it is not today or tomorrow but the two or three weeks before the referendum that will be crucial.  Notwithstanding that, this is a very important debate.<\/p><p>Many say we need the Seanad to keep a check on the D&aacute;il and its loss would be an attack on the democratic system.  That is the major argument I hear in Haggardstown about the abolition of the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400028#BB00300","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1372944300,"counter":252,"content":"<p>In Sextons in Haggardstown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400028#BB00400","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1372944300,"counter":253,"content":"<p>And in other places.

Last week Senator Eamonn Coghlan wondered whether the idea arose over a pint or a cup of coffee, and for all we know, that is the case.  Certainly the idea was landed on a surprised Fine Gael Parliamentary Party in a hotel in west Dublin before a Fine Gael dinner live on television.  Therefore, Senator Eamonn Coghlan's theory has a semblance of some truth.  The idea came from the Citywest Hotel in west Dublin to radically change the Constitution with dozens of amendments.  I challenge anyone in the House who has not yet done so to read every single section of the Constitution that will be amended, because if not one should not vote to put the legislation through.  I suggest there are very few people who have read through every line of the legislation and every line of the Constitution that will be demolished.  What a kick in the teeth for Fine Gael Senators, in particular, who gave loyalty to their leader at a time when others were noticeable by their disloyalty and their opposition to that Taoiseach.<\/p><p>Maybe those who were disloyal and opposed the Taoiseach had a point.  His behaviour last week was disgraceful when he referred to the axis of collusion.  It is a theme he has continued with because he once stated that a file had been done away with or dispatched within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I do not know how civil servants who are in charges of these files reacted to that.  It has been rarely mentioned since that outrageous statement by the Taoiseach in relation to the files but Fianna F&aacute;il put in a freedom of information request and found dozens of documents in the Department of the Taoiseach, and they are included in the thousands of documents the Nyberg commission examined.  Instead, we have had a Taoiseach who has been willing to use his office and the D&aacute;il to smear people, and the smearing has started to move on to his own now.  I see colleagues in the House and Deputies who are shaking over what is happening within the Fine Gael Party.  The loyalty the Taoiseach seeks from his members is not the loyalty he gave to Members of the Seanad who, from media reports, backed him and ensured he remained as Fine Gael leader.  What is going on within that party is not fair and it relates back to the way the Taoiseach does his business. <\/p><p>Like Senator Marie Moloney, I am delighted I was elected to the Seanad.  I was a Deputy and I make no apologies for seeking election to the Seanad.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party got the second highest number of votes in County Meath, but due to the structure of the constituencies, we did not win any D&aacute;il seats.  It is legitimate that Fianna F&aacute;il has a voice in County Meath, having got more votes than some of the parties who got seats.  I have sought to represent the 6,000 people or so who voted for me in the general election and also the other thousands who voted for my colleagues to represent a viewpoint that is important in society.<\/p><p>In regard to Seanad electoral panels, there is an idea that somehow it is a doddle to get on to a panel and that one just goes in and ticks the box.  That is not true, and I speak from experience.<\/p> <p>I was initially asked by my party to consider running on the agricultural panel.  The Clerk of the Seanad in her wisdom, and she was right, refused to allow me to run on the agricultural panel because my qualifications were insufficient for it.  I was quite bluntly told that the cultural and educational panel was the only panel for me.  If one reads the Constitution, and many do not, it includes professions such as medicine and law.  As a solicitor, that was the panel for me and I was bluntly told as much.  Many people consider it to be the toughest panel due to the fact that it has the lowest number of seats and the highest quota.  I could do that because I had considerable experience in the law for many years before my election first to the D&aacute;il and then to this House.<\/p><p>It is said that nothing happens in the Seanad.  Only last week the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did not quite accept an amendment I tabled but offered his own alternative amendment to provide for something I had proposed regarding the public service Bill.  I was annoyed last week to see the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il blame the Seanad for the delay to the reform of commercial rates.  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill was introduced in the Seanad by the Government and the Taoiseach was asked about its status last week on the Order of Business.  He said he would have to inquire with the Seanad but that he knew it works slowly, or words to that effect.  The reality is that the Bill was stopped in the Seanad because it was deeply flawed, possibly unconstitutional and harmful to business.  The Bill was debated on Second Stage, when concerns were raised by the Opposition and, indeed, some Government Senators, and it is now back on the shelf, presumably being redrafted because it has not reached Committee Stage and appears to be going nowhere.  Significant constitutional issues were raised about the Bill, and the mode of appeal, by people in the industry and these were raised in the Seanad, so the Bill has been stopped.  It is thanks to the Seanad that it has been and it should not go to Committee Stage unless the Government puts forward significant amendments.<\/p><p>We have been given yet more promises about D&aacute;il reform.  All the people ask the Government to do is implement what is in the programme for Government.  Huge D&aacute;il reform is promised in the programme for Government but, in effect, nothing has been implemented.  Instead, the Government has taken over the committees.  There is no Opposition Member in the chair of any of the sectoral committees.  In the last D&aacute;il the two European committees were chaired by Fine Gael Deputies, the industry and commerce committee was chaired by a Labour Party Deputy, the Committee of Public Accounts is always chaired by an Opposition Deputy and I believe the committee on the Constitution was chaired by an Opposition Deputy.  Vice-chairmanships in some committees were also given to the Opposition.  However, the Opposition holds no vice-chairmanships in any committees at present.  The Government has gone backwards.<\/p><p>There are more guillotines now than ever.  The promise in the programme for Government that there would be two weeks between each Stage of legislation in the D&aacute;il has been observed more by its breach.  There were not even two hours between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill this week.  In promising more reform the Government is merely highlighting the failure to implement what it promised previously.  The Friday sittings are a farce.  So few Members attend the Friday sittings that the divisions are held on the following Tuesday.  That is the reality and it speaks for itself.  The Government cannot whip a division in the D&aacute;il on a Friday because not enough Members attend.  Real political reform was promised by the Government but it has not been delivered.  Instead, the abolition of the Seanad has been handed up on a plate while all the other problems continue.<\/p><p>A fundamental overhaul of the political system is required.  We need more than stunts, and this Bill is a stunt.  However, I will repeat my challenge before I conclude.  No Member should vote against this Bill until they have read every line of it.  There is a great deal more in this Bill than in the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention.  There was very little from the Constitutional Convention but this Bill amends the Constitution throughout that document.  It must be read by every Member before they vote to change the Constitution in such a way.  I will repeat that challenge to the public and ask people to look at every line of the legislation.  The reason a number of European treaties were rejected is that Ministers admitted that they had not actually read them.  Shame on them.  That is happening with this legislation as well.<\/p><p>There is another point.  The Seanad is referred to approximately 1,100 times in Irish legislation.  Has anything to be done about that?  Perhaps the Minister can answer that question.  We are told that the Parliamentary Counsel is extremely busy and that important legislation on health reform, sectoral reform and the legal services sector is being held up because of that.  Will the Parliamentary Counsel now have to amend the more than 1,000 legislative measures in which the Seanad is mentioned, aside from in the Constitution?  I have not heard anything about that.  It would take a huge amount of parliamentary time and a huge amount of time for civil servants.<\/p><p>I will ask the people to read this document and vote against it to ensure that this Government is held to account.  The super majority in the D&aacute;il is not doing that.  I urge the public to look at the promises and commitments in the programme for Government relating to D&aacute;il reform, see the evidence that they have been observed more in their breach and wonder about the promises being made now to change the way the D&aacute;il works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400028#BB00600","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372944900,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The first Seanad met on 11 December 1922 in the National Museum on Kildare Street.  Sir Thomas Henry Grattan Esmonde, the great-grandson of Henry Grattan, was the first to take his seat in the new Seanad in what was a very different Ireland.  Of the 489 Bills received from 1922 to 1936 the Seanad substantially amended 182 of them before they became law.  The weight of the Seanad's authority was such that of the 1,831 amendments made to primary legislation, the D&aacute;il agreed to 1,719.  In 14 years the D&aacute;il accepted 95% of all amendments and only rejected outright 86 Seanad amendments.  That was a time when the Seanad had real power, a time when it was a democratic and effective second Chamber in which real contributions were made to legislation.<\/p><p>Regrettably, this role has changed over the years.  It has changed to the point where we now have an Upper House that is treated with contempt.  It is a shadow of what it once was.  It disappoints me when I hear the Seanad, once a great institution, referred to as a cross between a political convalescent home and a cr&egrave;che or training ground for the D&aacute;il, where the real action takes place.  The Seanad was never designed to be a training ground or a resting place.  It was designed to give a voice to vocational interests to check and balance legislation to ensure that it was effective and, more important, to ensure that we operate as an effective parliamentary democracy.<\/p><p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann was established in our Constitution in 1937 and is mentioned 75 times in the Constitution.  It appears that it would be a great deal easier to draft a new Constitution than to go through the process of changing 75 times.  The references to the Seanad highlight just how integral it is to the functioning of our nation.  I stand today to argue that abolition will not solve but rather cause problems.  Let us be very clear.  Abolishing the Seanad is the easy option or easy way out.  While I agree it must be put to the people to decide on the future of the Seanad, we should be considering concrete reform proposals to give voters an alternative option and to show people what the Seanad could be if we radically reform how it operates.<\/p><p>Abolishing the Seanad for the sake of political grandstanding will be a retrograde step, one which I am sure we will regret in years to come.  What we need is a dynamic, cost effective, gender equal, functional second House that will act as a check and balance on the powers of the D&aacute;il.  A reformed Seanad would be a tool used by the people to hold the Government of the day to account.  Who knows what Governments we will have in the future?  Who knows what majorities they will have or what type of power they will wield?  Perish the thought that some Member of the other House would become Taoiseach with a massive majority.  It beggars belief.  In my opinion, in the case of some Members, and I will not name them, we could have a dictatorship in a very easy way.<\/p> <p> We now need new ways to choose Senators, ways that involve the wider population and gives the public a role and say in the make-up of the Seanad.  We do not need constitutional change to allow direct election to the Seanad by functional or vocational groups in substitution for the existing system of panel elected Senators.  A reformed Seanad could represent diverse interest groups from all over Ireland and give them a real input into how we craft and pass laws.  We need to create a Seanad that reflects the modern Irish nation which is confident, proud and emerging from years of mismanagement and political cronyism.  We need a second House with teeth that can hold the institutions of Government to account.  We need a second House that acts in the interest of people and on their behalf.<\/p><p>People are looking for an institution that they can turn to because the Government, the church and even the media have not covered themselves in glory for the past 20 years.  People are looking for an institution of the State that they can trust.  A reformed Seanad could be that institution but only with real and substantial reform.  Let us allow the Seanad to do the job that it was established to do, namely, to represent civic society, interest groups and all elements of a diverse island.  Let us not mutilate the Constitution and allow the D&aacute;il unlimited powers for the sake of saving a few euro.  I support giving the public a voice in the referendum but I cannot support the notion that democracy in Ireland will be enhanced if we abolish the Seanad.  I am disappointed that we are not giving the people concrete reform proposals for the Seanad in advance of the referendum, in other words &quot;a preferendum.&quot;  <\/p><p>It is with regret that I sometimes look around me at the layers of useless State agencies and quangos that depend on taxpayers' money.  Instead of examining their role and function we are looking to abolish a pillar of the State, one of the foundations upon which Irish democracy was built.  The Seanad is an institution that we could be proud of and it carries on the democratic principles of the men and women who fought so hard to bring peace and prosperity to Ireland.  Accordingly, I call on the people to direct their anger in the forthcoming referendum, and not make the Seanad the sacrificial lamb for the sins of a few.  <\/p><p>A proposal to get rid of the Seanad really means that democracy is being centralised.  I do not think that it will be abolished.  I think that the people, in their wisdom, will maintain the Seanad.  The intention of the proposal is to centralise democracy and not to the D&aacute;il but just to the 15 Members of Cabinet.  That is what we will be left with.  That is why we could in time have a dictatorship in this country. <\/p><p>It is ironic how many Deputies favour the abolition of the Seanad.  There are two reasons.  First, Deputies do not want an annoying Senator biting at their heels seeking to gazump him or her at the next election.  They want to rid themselves of Senators and get them out of their way.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400029#CC00200","speaker":"1163","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372945500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The parish priest would not know what else to do with himself.

That responsibility is even greater when the vandalism is being done to the most basic and fundamental institution in the State, namely, our Constitution.  That is precisely what we, as legislators and guardians of the Constitution, are being asked to do in voting for this Bill.  <\/p><p>Some colleagues on the Government side may want to comfort themselves by thinking that we are merely referring a matter to the people for their decision.  A quick read through the 19 pages of the deletions from the Constitution, set out in the Bill, should stir them from their complacency.  The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, acknowledged this himself when he stated earlier in May: &quot;My book is the Constitution.&quot;  Why is he now taking a slash hook to the Constitution to abolish the House?  Why is he giving the Constitutional Convention almost a year to reflect, debate and consider a range of individual changes yet expects the Oireachtas to swallow such a major democratic transformation in a matter of days?

As Senator Heffernan and other colleagues have said, it had more to do with the opinion polls at that time than genuine political reform.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach, at the MacGill Summer School in July 2009, said with regard to the Seanad:<blockquote>I see a different role for the Seanad here.  I would change the electoral system and give every graduate a vote here ... There is a real need for proper scrutiny of European legislation.  There is a need to have a forum for MEPs.  There is a need to challenge the Seanad in the work that it does.  Many people feel that it has just been a cosy House for far too long ... It has got real potential but it has got to be challenged in that sense. <\/blockquote>That was late July.  What happened in August and September to change the Taoiseach from being a reformer to an abolitionist?  <\/p><p>  The second myth is that the proposal is about reducing costs.  Senator Barrett and other colleagues have correctly pointed out that the abolition of the Seanad will not save a cent because the potential saving of a few million euro will be spent on extra committees to deal with the business that elected Members of this House should be doing.<\/p><p>  There are more myths but I shall not go through them.  Colleagues in both Houses asked for a calm, balanced and reasoned debate on this proposed legislation.  I shall mention a few words to the Minister of State that have been used by Ministers of both Government parties but not by him.<\/p> <p>This concerns me and all of my colleagues in the House.  We are surplus to requirements; we are wasters; we are not fit for purpose; and we are irrelevant.  Is that a balanced debate?  On 11 June a senior member of the Labour Party, Fergus \"head on a plate\" Finlay, said that we were \"a fossil, a meaningless artefact that adds no fundamental value\" to politics.  Is that a balanced and reasoned debate?  I suggest it is not.  Looking back in history, similar words were used to condition the German people on acts carried out in their name.  I will not get into that matter.  This House has had honourable and decent Members since its foundation right up to this day.<\/p><p>Political reform is not getting rid of town councils or reducing the number of Deputies by eight, when Fine Gael promised to reduce it by 20.  It will not reducing the number by 20 because we would need a referendum to do so and we could not have that.  Political reform is not reducing the number of councillors elected in rural Ireland and moving them to the east coast.  It is certainly not getting rid of one arm of democracy in our national Parliament.  The public wants a Parliament that scrutinises public policy, questions public officials and makes sure those who exercise power in the country, elected and unelected, are held accountable for their actions.  Getting rid of the Seanad would make the task more difficult.  The Government, particularly the Taoiseach, is proposing to replace this House with a committee.  We have all seen in recent days what happens to members of committees if they do not toe the line.  That is what our democracy will face if the people vote to get rid of this House.  We are asking that the question that we get rid of the Seanad or reform it be put to the people.  That is all we are asking if this dictatorial Taoiseach insists on putting a referendum to the people.<\/p><p>Another quotation is that it is &quot;populist nonsense for the Taoiseach to say that Ireland has too many politicians&quot; and that he is &quot;anti-politics and anti-democratic when he makes that assertion which contributes to the ongoing denigration of politics.&quot;   That is not good for any of us and it is not good for our democracy.  That comment came from a former Member of this House, Joanna Tuffy, who is now a Member of the other House, like the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  This is anti-politics and anti-democratic and I cannot disagree with the words of Deputy Joanna Tuffy.  I thank the Minister of State for sitting through the entire debate.  Only for this House, the country would have been deprived of him for almost five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400030#DD01200","speaker":"1164","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372946100,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, the Minister of State has been unavoidably called out of the House for a couple of minutes.

There have been many complaints, even on the Order of Business, that this is a Bill the objective of which is the abolition of the Seanad but its Title refers to the 32nd amendment of the Constitution, which implies the holding of a referendum.  We cannot change the Constitution without holding a referendum.  I compliment all those Senators who have spoken on their wonderful arguments.  I also compliment the Minister of State who, as Senator Diarmuid Wilson said, has great patience.  It is trying his constitution to have to listen to this debate, with some of which he does not agree, but we are all good democrats.  I, therefore, subscribe to what Senator Diarmuid Wilson said about him.  It was an honour to serve with him.<\/p> <p>I recall that the Minister of State, with the then Leader of the House, the former Senator Mary O'Rourke, and three other colleagues put together a wonderful report.  We might not have agreed with all of it, but we went with it because we were reformists in our own minds.  Perhaps I will come back to that theme.<\/p><p>We accept that the people must rule supreme in our democracy.  That is why this proposal is going to be put in a referendum.  The timing is lousy, in the sense that the term of the Government presumably has another two and a half years to run.  I do not know whether the referendum will be passed.  If it is - as a good democrat, my attitude is &quot;so be it&quot; - how will Senators be fixed for attending public meetings, etc?  Someone spoke about the jibes in newspaper letters and columns.  If this proposal is passed, what will people say to any of us when we attend various events?  I think the Minister of State understands why I think the timing could be better.  This referendum should have come much later in the term of the D&aacute;il, if at all.<\/p><p>I am a total reformist.  I subscribe to that view.  Like many other Senators on all sides of the House, I see this as a lessening of our democracy.  Obviously, there will be an automatic reduction in the number of politicians.  Some say it is a cheap shot to get rid of 60 politicians in one fell swoop.  It is obvious that this measure will increase the significance of the Executive, which is already pretty powerful in our system.  The Minister of State does not have to say anything because I understand from his smile that he agrees with me.  If the Seanad is abolished, this little country of ours will probably have more advisers than ever.<\/p><p>The referendum campaign will be very difficult for existing Senators.  I expect that the overwhelming majority of us will vote &quot;No&quot; in the secrecy of the voting booth.  The campaign will be difficult because whether we like it, we will be perceived to have a vested interest.  I do not intend to campaign in the referendum.  It will be difficult for me, given that the Taoiseach has already announced we will have at least one other referendum on the same date.  I assume that was a Government decision.  The Minister of State might confirm this when he responds at the end of the debate.  It is planned to hold a referendum on the same date to facilitate the establishment of a court of civil appeal.  Such a court is badly needed because the legal system is clogged up and a large number of cases are before the Supreme Court.  The Minister of State might comment on how many cases there are.  That is very bad justice and, of course, justice delayed is justice denied.  How many years will it take to have an appeal heard now?  I have no doubt that a court of civil appeal is necessary.<\/p><p>Much has been made of the financial saving that might result from the abolition of the Seanad.  Senator Feargal Quinn who is watching me like the wise old owl that he is has exploded that myth.  We know there will be no savings whatsoever.  There have been disputes about the figures.  I understand the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has said these resources will be diverted into a revised or reformed committee structure.  With respect, that is a possible waste.  All Deputies have to serve on one committee or another.  I am not sure they are all fully committed to committees unless a constituency matter arises, but perhaps I should not say that.  It is understandable, given our human nature, that the constituency is everything.  I am sure the Minister of State is always focused-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400031#EE00300","speaker":"1151","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372946400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I think that is changing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400032#FF00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372946400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister of State is right, but I do not think Deputies really see themselves as legislators.

I do not mean this as a slight on the Minister of State who is an exceptional person.  The same can be said about an awful lot of Deputies, if not most of them.  When the interaction and the play get going in the D&aacute;il, they feed into people's perception of the D&aacute;il as a hurdy-gurdy dysfunctional Punch and Judy show.  I am not saying it does not happen here on an odd occasion.  However, this is a more objective and less partisan Chamber.  It is sad that many people have that impression of the D&aacute;il.  It has been said the people might abolish the D&aacute;il also if they were given the choice.  That is a reflection of the effects of the recession and the terrible times people are going through.

As we know, there is a constitutional obligation on this House to process all legislation, just as the D&aacute;il does.  Many Ministers, past and present, have found this a more objective and less partisan Chamber which is more conducive to teasing out the core issues involved in every Bill.  The current ones do not go on the record about it, but some of the former ones do.  It may be the case that Senators have, or used to have, more time to devote to legislation.

In 1979 we had a referendum to extend the franchise for the university seats.  Every Government since has left that constitutional amendment in abeyance and failed to legislate for it.  It would have been wonderful for graduates of our third level institutions who live in Ireland and abroad to have had a say in the composition of one of the Houses of Parliament.

We are at a defining moment in Irish parliamentary democracy and we must proceed with great care lest we be sorry in the future.  The fundamental question we need to answer concerns what type of parliament we need to best serve the Irish people and whether the abolition of the Seanad will provide for that through this Bill.  I do not accept that it will.<\/p><p>Leaving out Seanad reform for the moment, this Bill could have presented a once-in-decades golden opportunity for the reform of politics, but it does not do that.  Unfortunately, this proposal is lazy and minimalist.  There are serious deficiencies in this Bill for what it envisages in the absence of a Seanad.  The first of these is the lack of any form of legislative delay provision, which is a glaring deficiency.  This is somewhat ironic, given the way this Bill was guillotined through the D&aacute;il, which is not unusual.  If this is agreed, there will be no constitutional requirement for a Bill to have even more than one reading or to go through more than one Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It will be quite feasible, even if unlikely, for a future government to change D&aacute;il procedures to require only a single vote to pass a Bill.  This is a clear danger of not having a second House.<\/p><p>Many of the small single-parliament countries held up as shining examples in the past few days or weeks have explicit constitutional requirements for at least two Stages when passing a Bill.  Most have some delay built in between these Stages, or at least the potential to trigger some delay.  This happened here naturally when a Bill had to come to the Seanad.  With the Seanad gone, this protection will be gone.  This is not good for democracy and will not provide for the necessary scrutiny of legislation which affects Irish people's lives daily.  For example, Luxembourg has a minimum delay of three months.  Finland has a veto of up to three months and in Iceland there is the potential for referral to a referendum.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, mentioned Denmark.  There, two-fifths of MPs can direct the Speaker to delay the Final Stage of a Bill by up to 12 weekdays.  Many larger countries still have their second chambers and the delay that comes with that.  Can we assume our Parliament functions so splendidly that such conventional safeguards would be superfluous?  We cannot.  We should not diminish democracy and nor should our Taoiseach.  Nor should we diminish the importance of reflection and consideration, which come only with time and legislative review.<\/p><p>What are the Taoiseach and Government offering instead in terms of an improved Parliament, which is ultimately about serving the people?  They are offering Friday D&aacute;il sittings, which are essentially window dressing.  These are not realistic for country Members and do not constitute meaningful reform.  D&aacute;il Deputies need to be in their constituencies to take soundings on the issues that matter to people if they are to inform policy and legislation effectively.  A strengthened committee system has also been promised, but that is not mentioned in this Bill.  I love the capacity for exchange in committees and find it useful.  However, only members of a committee can propose amendments and vote on them.  Committee members nominated by parties are frequently groomed into consensus.  Consider, for example, the effect of this on the health committee hearings on the abortion Bill.  Apart from a few independent voices, that committee in no way reflected the level of difference across the House or among the public.  Contrast that with the diversity and detail offered in the 2,664 amendments introduced to improve legislation in the Seanad during this term alone.  I was stunned by the number of amendments introduced here when I checked the number.  There is not time for such detail in the D&aacute;il.  Let us be careful, therefore, that in deciding to abolish the Seanad we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Remember, the devil is generally in the detail.<\/p><p>What is possible with this approach, with the promised referendum to change the Constitution?  Ideally, an amendment Bill would have transferred the Seanad's notional delay powers to the D&aacute;il and made them functional.  For example, it would write in an explicit requirement for two or more Stages into the Constitution and perhaps it would allow for a qualified majority of one-third of Deputies to ask the Ceann Comhairle to delay the Final Stage of a money Bill for 21 days and that of a non-money Bill for three months.  This provision is already in the Constitution for the Seanad. <\/p><p>Look at the folly of the blanket bank guarantee - something we rue to this day - which was rushed into overnight and left us in hock up to our ears for generations to come.  Of course we must move swiftly sometimes, but the provisions for emergency Bills already exist, if the President assents.  It is a concern that a Government with a majority of almost two-thirds, which guillotines more Bills than not, has neglected to include any form of legislative break whatsoever in this amendment.<\/p><p>The second major deficiency of this Bill is the elimination of the possibility of having two non-D&aacute;il Ministers, which may come as a surprise to Members.  A former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, appointed a Senator, Jim Dooge, as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would like to have seen that provision retained because, as we know, the necessary expertise is not always elected to the D&aacute;il.  What, for example, would be wrong with having an Elderfield, a Honohan or a Ken Whitaker appointed to Cabinet to provide expertise?  This would demonstrate thinking politics, rather than simplistic populist politics designed to pretend that abolition equates to reform.  I am sorry to say that the leader of my party, the Taoiseach, has subscribed to that approach.<\/p><p>The third deficiency is one the people need to be made aware of.  This amendment Bill will lead to the deletion of Article 27 of the Constitution, which provides the Seanad with the ability to petition the President for a referendum.  I know the people will be concerned by this when they are made aware of it.  Do other single-house parliaments have this provision?  They do.  Denmark, for example, has had an even stronger provision in its constitution for decades, whereby one-third of its members can petition the Speaker for a referendum.  I feel that the retention of this provision would be very useful, because it provides a useful safeguard for Bills of national importance, such as the abortion Bill.  However, with the proposed amendment to the Constitution, there is no replacement provision and this safeguard is gone.  Would Members consider that less or more democratic?  I see it as a further indication of a power grab and a move towards more absolutism.  If that is not the case, let us change this.<\/p><p>The fourth opportunity lost with this Bill was the opportunity to reform the election of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The fifth deficiency is that there are no proposals for D&aacute;il or committee reform in the Bill.  Despite the fact the Government has had two years to draft this Bill, there is no indication of any proposed D&aacute;il or committee reform in it.  This is appalling.  If the Government genuinely believes in D&aacute;il reform, why does it not enshrine the proposed new D&aacute;il and committee structures in our Constitution by way of this referendum?  This is a great opportunity.  Either the Government is serious about political reform or it is not.  If it does not want to do it in the Constitution, the D&aacute;il could, as we know, pass these reforms next week if it were serious about doing so.<\/p><p>As I see it, there are two options for genuine political reform.  The Seanad could simply be reformed in a way that would not need a referendum - for example, through the passing of a Bill such as either of those put forward by Senators Quinn and Zappone.  Alternatively, these improved roles or powers could be transferred to the D&aacute;il.  However, that is not built into this Bill.  It does neither of these.  It would be easier to vote in favour of abolition if the Bill provided for reform.  The Bill proposes a very poor offering to the people.  Thus, I believe that once the people realise what is going on here, there will be a strong vote against the abolition of the Seanad.<\/p><p>With regard to my position, I am fundamentally a democrat.  On that basis, I will vote in favour of a referendum and give the people the opportunity to vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to abolition.  However, I do not agree with their being given only that choice.  Today I call on the Taoiseach to frame the choice offered to the people in the form of a yes-or-no question asking whether they agree with reform of the Seanad.  Democracy is not something to be trifled with.  It was hard won by our forefathers.  All of us in these Houses, including the Minister of State, are but guardians of the Constitution for a very short time.  Therefore, before we decide to throw the Seanad, our second limb of democracy, away, I recommend that we look very carefully at how to improve and reform it before the referendum.<\/p> <p>If the choice is \"Yes\" or \"No\" to abolition, I will be recommending a \"No\" vote on the basis that \"No\" will be a call for a reformed Seanad at the next general election, or at the very least, a radically reformed D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>I want to speak very quickly on the opportunities for reform.  First, there must be universal suffrage.  Second, expertise matters.  A reformed Seanad should provide the expertise needed to represent the needs of Irish society in a functioning and effective democracy.  Third, a reformed Seanad does not a Whip system.  That is not envisaged at all in the Constitution.  Without the party Whip system, the people could have more confidence in the independence of thought of its Members.  With the Whip system, one is essentially asked to leave one's brain and one's conscience outside the door.  That is appalling and is not what Irish people expect when they put their confidence in electing politicians.  Without a Whip system, a consensus and a majority view can still emerge in the Seanad.  Directly elected by the people to the various panels of expertise, its members can represent independent thinking without fear or favour of the Whip system.<\/p><p>The Whip system in the Irish Parliament is more oppressive than any other in the Western world.  The American President, Barack Obama, tried to bring in gun legislation, but he could not do it because his party did not back him.  They do things over there by negotiation and by making a strong case.  In Westminster, Conservative Party backbenchers can introduce a Bill against the wishes of their leader, yet they do not lose the Whip.  Maggie Thatcher, as British Prime Minister, voted against her own Government on hare coursing, which is not unheard of here.  Such a democratic approach instills the confidence of the people in the Members they elect.<\/p><p>Between the lack of a free vote on conscience grounds, about which we have heard a lot in the last few weeks, and the elimination of the Seanad without a stronger alternative, I believe something very bad and unhealthy is afoot.  Our Taoiseach should not be afraid of losing control.  Nobody wants this Government to fall or to fail.  We want it to succeed, but we want it to be democratic in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400033#GG00100","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372947600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

The Minister of State has learned his skill well and made a major contribution to Irish politics since he first became a Member of this House and subsequently a Member of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>I was present on the night in 2009 when our party leader announced the decision to hold a referendum on the future of the Seanad.  I remember the shock and horror on the faces of Members of the Oireachtas that night when they heard the news.  However, I think everybody expected it would be quietly dropped and forgotten after the general election.  People misread the determination of the Taoiseach, and the commitment to hold the referendum was included in the programme for Government.  That is why we are here today debating this issue.  I have always had a high regard for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and as a political junkie I have always followed the proceedings of the House with great interest over the years.  I am acutely aware of the contribution that Members of this House have made to society and to our country in different walks of life.  It is worth recalling the contribution that was made to peace and reconciliation by people such as Seamus Mallon and Gordon Wilson, the contribution made to advancing human rights by people such as David Norris, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and Ivana Bacik, and the contribution made to business by people such as T. K. Whitaker, Se&aacute;n Barrett and Feargal Quinn, among many others who have occupied these seats over the years.<\/p><p>I was very honoured to be nominated by the Irish Vocational Education Association to contest the Seanad election on the cultural and educational panel in 2011.  I will always be grateful to the members of the local authorities around the country who elected me.  Because of that, I have a mandate to represent my constituency and people through the country.  I got a very significant first preference vote from councillors who in many cases were elected by up to 2,000 people.  Having served on a local authority for 25 years, I feel that the electoral process for the Seanad needs reform.  Even though we all have a mandate, it is somewhat elitist that 43 seats are filled through election by members of the incoming D&aacute;il, the outgoing Seanad and local authorities, and six seats are filled by graduates of the NUI and Trinity College, to the exclusion of other third level graduates.  The Taoiseach then gets to fill 11 seats to ensure a government majority.<\/p><p>In his contribution to the debate here, the Taoiseach rightly highlighted the fact that after 75 years and ten comprehensive reports, not one iota of reform has taken place in the Seanad.  Successive governments failed to do anything about reform because it suited them to keep the Seanad neutered.  Senators over the years must take responsibility for the lack of reform, particularly those from government parties that held power for long periods.  They failed to convince their government and ministerial colleagues that the Seanad had a significant contribution to make to our democracy and was worth reforming, in spite of significant reports highlighting the need for reform by many political heavyweights, including a former Minister and former Leader of the Seanad, Mary O'Rourke.  The Minister of State had an input into that particular document.  If he had had the opportunity, I feel that our current Leader would have succeeded in convincing the Government of the need to reform the Seanad, given the many innovative things he has brought to the House since 2011.<\/p><p>I was very disappointed that Seanad reform and the future of the Seanad was not included for discussion at the Constitutional Convention.  As the Taoiseach said, &quot;The convention is a new and stimulating means of examining constitutional reform, one which puts people in their proper place at the very heart of the process, because it is to them that the Constitution of our country belongs.&quot;  If the people of Ireland decide to retain the Seanad, I hope the Government will ask the Constitutional Convention to deliberate on this particular issue.<\/p><p>Few people will disagree on the need for reform of our political system.  We need better and stronger local government in which we devolve real powers to our councillors and our elected members.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is to be commended for his Putting People First programme, and I hope it works.  There are some sceptics out there who are disappointed that town councils are to be abolished.  I share some concerns about that as well, but I feel the Minister is on the right track and he will have the support of this House in his endeavours.<\/p><p>The D&aacute;il and Oireachtas committees need radical reform and I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to this.   However, our economic crash of recent years highlighted the impact of poor politics and poor regulation of our financial institutions.  As we prepare to exit the bailout, we need to put in place a political system that ensures we never repeat the mistakes of the past.  In my opinion, a reformed Seanad can play a crucial role in rebuilding our country and protecting our democracy through better scrutiny of legislation.  As we all know, the D&aacute;il does not always get it right.  This House has made many amendments to legislation that had been overlooked in the other House.<\/p> <p>As we know most of our legislation now comes from Europe and there is certainly no appropriate system in the House for the scrutiny of EU legislation.  What better place to do that than in Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  The Seanad should hold Government to account.  We should be using the expertise of the Seanad in a more productive way for the benefit of all our citizens.  We should have direct elections to this House with universal suffrage on panels of expertise.  Very few would disagree with that.<\/p><p>Much has been made of the cost of the Seanad and many Members have identified opportunities for reducing costs.  That is achievable.  The cost of the Seanad, even at the highest figure quoted, pales into insignificance when we consider what bad and poor government and bad regulation have cost this country over the past five or six years.  When they go to the polls the people will have major decisions to make.  They will have to decide whether they want to remove Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a major plank of our democratic system since the foundation of the State.  They will have to ask themselves whether they have confidence that a reformed D&aacute;il will be more effective than the current one and whether they want to give more power to unelected advisers, given our experience of them in the past.  I will be supporting the legislation here to enable the people to have their say but I must confirm that on referendum day I will be voting to retain the Seanad.  We must remember the people always get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400034#HH00600","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372948200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House today.  Like other Members I do not believe that the Seanad should stay as it is.  It has been an enormous privilege for me to be here for the past two years.  I am extremely grateful to the members of the county councils around the country who elected me.  It was a tough campaign, harder than the general election campaign, believe it or not, for a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate in 2011.   While the general election campaign was tough I had a team of people in my local area and I went home to my own bed.  For the Seanad campaign I met county councillors in different counties and was interrogated quite rigorously by them on a range of issues.  It was a tough campaign and assured me that the electors take their job quite seriously to ensure that they put all candidates through their paces.<\/p><p>  At the same time I fully appreciate that every citizen does not have a vote.  It means that the House is seen as elitist.  It is seen as the preserve of a small few and that is a shame.  The lack of universal suffrage means that, no matter what we do, our legitimacy is undermined.  Often the House makes a far greater contribution than is appreciated.  My experience is that in general debates here are much less partisan, reflect more on and tease out legislation.  Members take their job very seriously and do their best by proposing amendments and suggestions that some Ministers accept.  As spokesperson on education I have always found the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruar&iacute; Quinn very receptive.  He has accepted some of my amendments to important legislation on quality assurance in the third level sector, child vetting and other similar issues that had not been addressed in the other House.  He has taken them on board because he has come into the House with an open attitude and a willingness to listen to ideas from all sides.<\/p><p>  We have brought forward excellent Bills in the past two years.  I hope that the D&aacute;il will pass Senator Quinn's Construction Contracts Bill next week.  It is incredibly important legislation which would not have come to fruition but that we had an outlet in this House for somebody of Senator Quinn's expertise and business acumen, and the perspective which he brings to the Oireachtas.  The same is true of Senator Crown's Bill on smoking in cars.  I hope that, while the Government shot down the employment equality Bill that I brought forward last year, the principles behind it will be taken on board.  That has helped to put pressure on the Government to deal with an important gap in our protection for employees.  Much important work is done here.<\/p><p>  There are parts of the House and its business that frustrate me.  It will be no secret to Members that generally I do not participate in the Order of Business.  I table Adjournment Matters, two of which were selected this week and two last week because I prefer to have a debate with a Minister.  I do not see the point in shouting at Senator Cummins of a morning about all the ills of society.  I do not do the amateur dramatics.  I regret the fact that while excellent work is done here on legislation the only thing that is covered on Oireachtas Report and other programmes is the first hour of the day which makes it look like that is all we do.  That is a great shame.  We had a really good debate here a few weeks ago on youth unemployment, with really good suggestions put forward by Members on all sides of the House but that was not covered.  The same applies to mental health, jobs and other key issues.  Unfortunately that is not covered.  I am not blaming the media for that because that it is too easy to do.  In some ways we give them that content.  I respect the fact that people have different ways of contributing but that is part of what we do that I wish we did not do.  I wish we could just agree the Order of Business and get on with discussing issues and ensuring that we present that view to the outside world because there is much good done here.<\/p><p>  This Seanad has performed better than is sometimes appreciated but I believe that it needs to be changed.  I do not believe the House should remain as it is.  The electoral system is deeply flawed and undermines our legitimacy.  There is too much duplication of what goes on in the D&aacute;il.  As things stand we get the same business a week or two later.  That is good for checks and balances but it means we miss the opportunity to do extra business.  The Leader of our House was very supportive, and said so in his speech last week, of an increased role for this House in the scrutiny of EU legislation and made that request to the Taoiseach.  Incredibly important EU decisions are made week in week out and most of our legislation now comes from Europe.  The Fine Gael Leader of the House suggested to the Taoiseach that we play a role in enhanced scrutiny of that legislation but that was declined.  That is a shame.  It means that important decisions are made that are not considered by either House.  Some of it gets to the bottom of a committee agenda somewhere but it does not get anything like the scrutiny it deserves.<\/p><p>  Our Leader also made the point that there is a new EU yellow card system whereby national parliaments can give a yellow card to European measures and ensure that they are thought through again.  I understand that has been used once since the Lisbon treaty was passed.  That is regrettable.  This House should have been given the opportunity over the past two years to fulfil its potential.  This is because the Taoiseach has a point to prove about wanting to run down the Seanad and not wanting to give us the opportunity to do our best to represent the people and bring forward issues which would prove that we need a second House.  That is why there has been constant guillotining of debates.<\/p><p>  It is also very unfair to the people that they will not be given a choice in the referendum because what is there to fear from asking ordinary citizens whether they want abolition, reform or the <i>status quo<\/i>?  Why is the Taoiseach willing only to allow the people consider the <i>status quo<\/i> or abolition?  This House has put forward excellent legislation.  There is a general framework for a radically reformed and powerful Seanad in the Bill published by Senators Quinn, Zappone and others.  I would provide for a far better electoral system, a totally different cadre of politicians from those elected to the D&aacute;il, people with different perspectives, representing vocational interests, a direct vote and increased powers.  That option will not be put to the people.<\/p><p>  It has not even been put to the Convention on the Constitution.  I am a member of that convention and the citizens who take part in it take their role incredibly seriously.  They give up their weekends to deliberate on political reform issues.  At our first meeting the Taoiseach sent us an agenda to discuss the voting age and the length of the presidential term.  We disposed of the second matter in half an hour because people wondered why, in the scheme of things, with all that is going on in the country they were being brought together in a hotel to discuss the length of the presidential term.  It is crazy that when it was suggested at one of the convention meetings that we would discuss the Seanad a very clear message came from the Taoiseach that it was not our business and we should not do that.<\/p> <p>A very clear message came from the Taoiseach to say that was not our business, we should not do it and that as far as he was concerned a referendum on abolition was being put to the people and that was that.  It has made a mockery of the convention process, which is a good idea and if the Taoiseach took it seriously it would have a lot of potential in terms of deliberative democracy and better representation.  <\/p><p>I find it very frustrating and disappointing that people will not be given that choice.  I would love to be able to engage in a referendum campaign and talk about how we could change how things are done here.  The role of senates in the US and other countries involves two totally different houses of parliament which are elected differently with different agendas.  That means proposed legislation is better thought through and considered from different perspectives.  There is a strong system of checks and balances.  Ultimately, it delivers better value for money for the taxpayer because it stops governments making mistakes and ensures things are thought through properly. <\/p><p>In contrast to what we could achieve with reform, all the option of abolition will do is consolidate more power in a Cabinet and flawed democratic system.  We have a D&aacute;il, which is where the real problems in the Oireachtas lie in my view and that of most political scientists and commentators in the country who follow what goes on in the D&aacute;il.  There are huge problems there.  Despite all of the promises before the election, the Government has refused to make any real effort at political reform, as has been mentioned by Senator Healy Eames and others.  All we have seen is constant guillotining of legislation in both Houses and much more concentration of power in a very small number of people.  <\/p><p>As I said at the start of my contribution, I do not believe the Seanad should remain in its current form.  I would be the first person to admit there are flaws at times in how some of our work is done.  The House makes a greater contribution than is often appreciated.  The people should be given a genuine choice and real option in a referendum.  If we are to go to the bother of spending a fortune on a referendum at a time of limited resources, we should at least make sure that it is worth people's while going to the polling stations and give them an option.  What is the Taoiseach afraid of?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400035#JJ00200","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372948800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I thank him for the patience and diligence he has shown in listening to the arguments.  <\/p><p>When the Seanad was founded in the early years of the State, it was envisaged that it should offer real opportunities for building bridges for all citizens.  It was supposed to have developed into a political platform where the citizens representing different sectors of society, be they from the north, south, east or west, abroad or at home, but that did not happen.  That is not how it evolved and is not the Seanad we have today. <\/p><p>This year we had an attempt by the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, to address this lack of participative democracy.  Various groups have addressed the House with valued input from our EU representatives, but that has not been enough.  We did not get the help we need to ensure it was and it could have been more.<\/p><p>We all knew when we signed up to put ourselves forward for election to the House that there would be a referendum and, true to his word, the Taoiseach has followed through on that.  I will vote &quot;Yes&quot; to ensure the people of the country are given the choice.  I ask that the people of the country are fully informed when they vote and are provided with the full facts and information on the functioning and cost of the House, and the cost of government as a whole, and the democratic deficit that will follow if the House is abolished.  Some 72 areas of the Constitution will be changed.  How is it proposed to inform the people?  Is it proposed to publish the 72 areas in booklet form by the Referendum Commission or whoever will provide the information? <\/p><p>I will give some evidence on the positive elements of a bicameral system of parliament.  The evidence suggests that bicameralism is not on the decline.  That is a verifiable fact.  Currently 40% of parliaments in the Interparliamentary Union have two legislative chambers.  Of 34 developed countries in the OECD, 19 have bicameral parliaments and 11 are unicameral.  Ireland is one of 13 EU countries to have a bicameral system and over five sixths of the population of the European Union live in countries with a bicameral system.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the role he and the Taoiseach played during the Presidency of the EU.<\/p><p>Studies illustrate the positive effects of bicameralism on parliamentary democracy in terms of representation, such as the process of legislative bargaining and the quality of legislative oversight of the executive.  Bicameralism affects policy and law.  Of course, this will be made more significant when one chamber has enough leverage over the other to act unilaterally.  This has proven to be true even where one chamber has to decide policy after the other has voted, as is the case in the Irish system.  Bicameralism also has the potential to protect minorities.  This could have been stronger had we had a reformed Seanad.  Many Governments had the opportunity to do so but did not take it.  I want to see wider representation in the Seanad if the people choose a reformed Seanad.  It is up to them.<\/p><p>We passed Second Stage of a Bill tabled by Senators Zappone and Quinn.  Homework has been done on how it could be implemented if the people choose not to abolish the Seanad.  They may not know the Bill exists.  People have spoken about the fact that the legislative process is not covered by the media.  The Order of Business is covered.  I was in the Chamber for three weeks when I asked for the Order of Business to be abolished.  Such a move may result in media covering the legislative process. <\/p><p>When I was elected, people asked me what we do in here.  People do not know what happens here.  If the foundations of the democracy continue to be weak whatever we build on them will also be weak.  <\/p><p>Senators focus more on legislation than on local issues, unlike Deputies, present company excluded.  I congratulate the Minister of State for his focused attention to his brief, not just in government.  He has done Trojan work in the EU, as I mentioned.  His input ensured Ireland performed in an excellent manner during the Presidency.  As as a constituency colleague, I know the Minister of State's ability and capability are not everyday happenings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400036#KK00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1372948800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400036#KK00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1372948800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Can we blame many Deputies for focusing, as some other Senators have mentioned, on their constituencies?  No, we cannot.  That is the system we have and it badly needs reform, perhaps more so than this House. <\/p><p>We also need reform at local level.  Devolution of functions is something we have long spoken about.  Councillors must be given real powers and revenue raising abilities, taking the national politicians out of the power broking equation.  This applies equally to Senators.  We have seen reform from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with the abolition of town councils and 1,254 local town councillors, to whom I pay tribute for their Trojan work and commitment to local democracy.<\/p><p>I recognise what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has done in transferring some power from councils to districts.  Some 81 powers have been transferred to local district councils, which is a great improvement on what was in place when I was involved in an area district council.  More has to be done.  Deck chairs are being shifted from county to district level but not from central to district level. <\/p><p>The Minister has asked for reports from each Department on where more devolution of functions could take place, and I await the completion of that exercise.  In respect of the devolution of functions, I agree with the Taoiseach when he said in 2009 that a huge centralisation of power in Ireland is incompatible with a healthy republic.  <\/p><p>The Seanad has a role in counterbalancing the D&aacute;il, something to which many speakers referred and on which I will not dwell.  Since I came to the House I have heard many times that the quality of debate here far exceeds that of the other House, not because of lesser ability but because of time management and systems.  As one person who visited both Houses said, &quot;I know now why the Seanad is called the Upper House.&quot; <\/p><p>I also wish to note the non-adversarial methodology and style which usually pertains in the House.

If the question is carried, Standing Order 119 also provides that the Bill shall forthwith be declared to have been read a Second Time.<\/p> <p>Then we would really be talking about saving money.  It will it be shifting the cost of &euro;8.5 million from the Seanad to the committees, with less democracy.  I do not have the answer.  Participative democracy must be encouraged as well as the participative budgetary process.  Hopefully this work is progressing.  I have confidence in the Taoiseach in this regard.  This has not been a policy of any previous Government and it is time for a change.<\/p><p>Some years ago while in Germany I attended a local district authority meeting to observe local democracy in action.  The people participated in the budgetary process for their local area.  Previous Governments had plenty of opportunities for reform.  Ten reports were published and nothing was done.  They sat on the fence but now the Opposition is getting into action.  However, everyone is to blame.  This Government has only been in power for two years during which time there has been massive change and I look forward to more.  We sat on the fence for so long but we are ready to press the &quot;Exit&quot; button now if the people wish it.  They must make an informed choice.  At least the Taoiseach is doing something, even if we do not particularly like it.  We knew it was coming when we signed on the dotted line.<\/p><p>I ask why reform of the D&aacute;il must wait.  Why not carry out the reforms promised by the Taoiseach?  I suggest a simple change to Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il to provide for advance scrutiny of intended legislation, committee chairmanships and revised procedures.  As an avid attendee of committees of which I am a member I am not enamoured with the committee system as it stands.  It needs radical reform.  Participation is minimal and input is poor.  Why not try to reform and strengthen the committee system before the Seanad is abolished?  We have only a couple of weeks and I do not think that will be done.<\/p><p>The current D&aacute;il scrutiny of EU legislation in the post-Lisbon EU legislative process is virtually non-existent.  I do not believe that Members of the D&aacute;il have any intention of really doing that work.  It will not happen in the future for exactly the same reason that it is not happening now because it will not help a Deputy to be re-elected, as many Senators have said.  Senator Maurice Cummins, the Leader of the House, attempted to address this issue but it is not possible to achieve if our hands are tied behind our backs.<\/p><p>At least the Seanad offers an opportunity to contribute to political life to those other than politicians, such as from the universities and other institutions and this also offers voting opportunities to people who are abroad.   The Whip system is not ideal but I ask if anything could be put through the House without that system.<\/p><p>Finland, with a similar population to Ireland, has been referred to as an example of a unicameral system.  However, there is a significant difference between Ireland and Finland.  The independence of individual parliamentarians is constitutionally guaranteed in Finland.  The Finnish Parliament also has an opt-out conscience clause.  When comparing democracies and the bicameral and unicameral systems, like should be compared with like, because everything matters in democracy.  If we give away one, we should ensure that we retain the other.  I trust the people that they will make an informed choice and that they will be provided with information. <\/p><p>If the Seanad is abolished, issues to be dealt with will include: Article 36 of the Constitution which deals with the removal of judges - and I am sure they will have something to say about that; the Presidential Commission; Article 27 which provides for a petition to refer Bills of national importance to the people; Article 28-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400036#MM05600","speaker":"1120","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372949400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400037#LL00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1372949400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>-----provides that the Seanad has the right to ask for an inquiry.

The shocking revelations on the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme about the inspection procedures in cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities throughout the country appalled the nation.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in the immediate aftermath of the programme, promised a great deal of reform and I have tabled this matter in that context.  As chairman of Leitrim county child care committee, I am aware of a vacancy and, by extension, an inherent flaw in the inspection system in the county, which is also the case in other counties.  In this instance, there has been a public health nurse vacancy for some time.  The reason, I understand, is the Government embargo.  If the Government parties are serious about ensuring an open, transparent and effective inspection regime, they need to move rapidly to appoint people to fill these vacancies.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation recently announced that it would not allow any of its members to be reassigned to these positions where they were required.

The shocking revelations on the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme about the inspection procedures in cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities throughout the country appalled the nation.

As chairman of Leitrim county child care committee, I am aware of a vacancy and, by extension, an inherent flaw in the inspection system in the county, which is also the case in other counties.  In this instance, there has been a public health nurse vacancy for some time.  The reason, I understand, is the Government embargo.  If the Government parties are serious about ensuring an open, transparent and effective inspection regime, they need to move rapidly to appoint people to fill these vacancies.

Currently, following a number of Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reports, it is under increasing pressure to maintain the complement of respite care within the hospital together with catering for the long-term patient care.<\/p><p>HIQA has identified a number of issues which the hospital must deal with, but these issues primarily pertain to the high level of admissions into the hospital last year, at over 700.  Approximately 80% of those admissions were for respite care and HIQA is of the view that, given the high level of admissions and discharges, the hospital needs additional staffing to meet the demands of the long-term stay patients in the hospital.  To cut a long story short, additional staff are required at the hospital.  However, the moratorium on recruitment in the public sector is causing difficulties in this regard.  Unless that is dealt with in the community nursing homes throughout the country, these difficulties will continue indefinitely.  Obviously there are issues regarding the structure of the building and the need to develop it, but that can be done at a later stage.  The most urgent matter at present is the need to lift the moratorium on recruitment for the nursing units in community hospitals throughout the country, including St. Joseph's, as well as those in Carndonagh and Dungloe in Donegal which were discussed in this Chamber last night.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will give an indication of whether he is willing to consider lifting the moratorium on recruitment or providing some level of flexibility in the moratorium for the community hospital sector.  According to the Health Service Executive, HSE, approximately 2.4% of the population aged more than 65 years is currently in nursing units.  That will increase to almost 4% in ten years.  If that is the case, what plan does the Department have in place to meet the increasing demand?  There will be a requirement for additional staff if that demand is to be met.  In addition, there will be a need for additional capacity in terms of new beds and facilities.  However, the issue tonight is the need to lift the moratorium on recruitment.  I thank the Minister for attending to reply on this Adjournment matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400038#SS00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1372950000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme.  In 2012, with a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, financial support was provided to over 22,000 people in nursing homes.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar.  As the Senator is aware, these are challenging times for the HSE in respect of all services.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard, all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and Government policy to reduce the numbers employed in the public sector.  This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole-time equivalents.  Staff appointments may be made only where an inescapable service need has been identified and which cannot be addressed by other means, such as the redeployment of staff or reorganisation of services.  The recently concluded Haddington Road agreement has increased the working week of nurses to 39 hours from 37.5 and also provided for increased hours for all other staff who were working less than a 39 hour week.  This will have the effect of increasing the overall staff capacity available to management to deploy in service delivery.<\/p><p>St. Joseph's Community Hospital was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority in June 2012.  The registration period is for three years and the current capacity is 75 beds.  The hospital provides a range of services, including respite, rehabilitation, palliative and intermediate care and there are 27 beds available for long-term residential care.  Day services are available from Monday to Friday and this supports the discharge planning processes at the hospital.  Older persons can avail of personal care, assistance with medical care and meal provision.  This provides respite to relatives and carers on a sessional basis up to five days a week.<\/p><p>The hospital was last inspected by HIQA in April 2013.  Concerns were expressed regarding the complexity of the mix of residents and the level of activity within the unit.  While the inspectors observed that staff provided care in acknowledgeable, competent and respectful manner, there was a concern that this complex mix of residents can make it more difficult for the staff to meet the needs of long-term residents.  To address this issue, the Barnes View ward has now been designated for long-stay residents only.  Dedicated staff have been assigned to the ward, which opened on 10 June last.  I am confident that this response will facilitate improved compliance with national standards.<\/p><p>Arising from this reconfiguration, staff reassignments and revised rosters were required.  These changes have been agreed and the revised rosters implemented with effect from 24 June.  When all changes have been completed St. Joseph's will have an operational capacity of 67 beds, including the 27 long-stay beds.  Residents and their families can be assured that management and staff will continue to work to provide the highest standards of care at St. Joseph's.  The HSE has asked me to assure the House that the residents are receiving a safe and quality service.  Bed capacity across all community hospitals in Donegal will be kept under ongoing review.  However, although the moratorium on recruitment remains in place, there are no current plans to further reduce bed capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400038#SS00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372950000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>To be honest, whoever drafted that response does not answer the question.  The line, \"Bed capacity across all community hospitals in Donegal will be kept under ongoing review\", is an insult to the communities in Donegal.  Every community group in Donegal that is connected to a hospital is already doing that.  Anybody can keep the bed capacity under review.  The Minister said the moratorium on recruitment will not be lifted, therefore the problem will not be resolved.  I realise the Minister is new to the Department and that he has conviction and passion, but I plead with him to look again at this issue.  It is a train coming down the tracks that will go off the rails unless it is dealt with.  The Minister should meet with the troika and tell it in no uncertain terms that there must be flexibility here.

I know some efforts have been made to change the visa regime, which has for a long time caused difficulties for Chinese people who wanted to visit Ireland.  <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, better systems in the United Kingdom have the consequence of putting people off from coming here, reducing investment in the country and tourist numbers.  Efforts have been made to reform the system and there has been much bilateral contact between Ireland and China, to which the Cathaoirleach recently led a delegation, of which my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, was part.  Some work has been done to change some of the more restrictive systems and make sure Chinese visitors to the United Kingdom are able to travel onwards to Ireland without applying separately.  However, there is still huge room for improvement.  Up to 2 million Chinese tourists visit Europe each year, of whom only 10,000 come to Ireland.  Given the attractiveness of this country, its sites and the rave reviews, it is a shame more visitors do not come here.  In a  poll in <i>The China Post<\/i>Chinese visitors who had visited Ireland rated it the most attractive destination in Europe.<\/p><p> I understand there are difficulties with the visa regime which put people off.  Chinese nationals living in Ireland have difficulty in arranging for family members to visit them.  I was recently contacted by a Chinese businesswoman who runs a business in Drumcondra.  She has been here for 11 years and has an Irish passport, as do her husband and children, yet she has difficulty in arranging for her parents to visit her and see their grandchildren.  They are retired and have sufficient resources to travel anywhere in the world and would like to see their grandchildren in Ireland.  However, every time they wish to do so, they must go through a cumbersome visa application process involving many documents and delays while waiting for an answer.  Just because one has been approved once does not mean the same will happen the second time.  This causes difficulties in booking flights, making arrangements and knowing the dates they will be in Ireland.<\/p><p> I have written to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the immigration office about the case.  I know the Minister of State cannot comment on individual cases, but I wanted to highlight the general difficulty because Ireland has a huge Chinese population.  We need to look at the arrangements made in other countries to make it easier for family visitors to come to visit family members and children who live in Ireland or for people to come as tourists and spend money here.  People applying for visas are well able to look after themselves and will make a major economic contribution here for a few weeks.  We should be doing everything possible to encourage them to come here.  We need a robust immigration system, but it appears to be overly cumbersome, which is a shame.  I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister the need to address these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400038#TT00700","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372950000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Senator for raising this issue.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to update the House on the numerous positive developments that have taken place in the Irish visa regime since the Government came to power and, in particular, developments in respect of visitors from China.  <\/p><p>The commitment of the Government to the facilitation and growth in the number of visits to Ireland from China is shown by the fact that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of the Department maintains a dedicated visa office in Beijing.  In general, business visas are processed within two to five working days of receipt of applications, while visit visa applications for Chinese nationals are processed within one to three weeks.  The approval rate for visa applications lodged in China for travel to Ireland is 95%, which compares favourably internationally.  Application guidelines for all visa categories are published on the Irish Embassy website in English and Chinese.  Applications for visas for Ireland are made online using a user-friendly web-based form.  This is in contrast with many visa regimes which require the completion of lengthy paper application forms.<\/p><p>There is no evidence that the visa process is a barrier to tourist, business or family visits from China to Ireland.  In fact, the latest report of the European Tour Operators Association which examined the effect of visa obligations on tourists from India and China covering the year 2010 showed that the figure for cancellations owing to perceived visa delays reflected very favourably on Ireland, with only 15% of clients reporting cancellations, as against 21% for the Schengen area and 24% for the United Kingdom.  This demonstrates that Ireland is not at a disadvantage against its main competitors owing to any issue with perceived delays in visa processing.  The Minister is advised that the checking procedures and processes in place are at least on a par with those in the United Kingdom, with which we share a common immigration area, and less onerous than those in place for many other EU member states.  Of far greater impact on both tourist and business visits is the lack of a direct air link between the two countries.  If the Senator has a particular case in mind or has suggestions to further improve the situation, while maintaining sensible immigration checks, the Minister would be glad to receive them.<\/p><p>The Minister launched the short stay visa waiver programme, the first of its kind in the history of the State, on 1 July 2011.  This allows visitors or business people, including those from China, who have lawfully entered the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  CSO figures for the numbers of trips by Chinese nationals to Ireland show that there was a 24% increase in the 12 months following the introduction of the waiver programme compared to the 12 months before.  This demonstrates the positive impact of the Government's initiative.<\/p><p>With effect from 1 August 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other visitors was implemented in the Irish visa office in Beijing.  The regime has been extended to regular family visitors with a good immigration history.  The Minister has asked his officials to examine how this regime could be further developed.  In recognition of the growing number of affluent and independent tourists from China, a scheme to enable independent Chinese travellers to come to Ireland was introduced in November 2011.  The category was formally launched by the Taoiseach during the course of his official visit to China in April 2012.  The visa application requirements for independent tourists are minimal and I am informed that Tourism Ireland has welcomed this initiative.  This category of visa application is processed within ten working days.<\/p><p>With regard to Chinese nationals visiting Ireland for study purposes, in 2012 a pilot programme in respect of English language study was developed jointly between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and Marketing English in Ireland, the umbrella body for English language schools, for the Chinese market.  The programme seeks to target high quality, motivated English language students and aims to develop the market in a sustainable way.  The programme is designed to significantly contribute to the development of Ireland's reputation as a premier destination for Chinese students to achieve a high standard in English language education.  The programmes are at an early stage and it is important that they be given sufficient time to grow and develop before a final review is undertaken.  However, progress under these programmes is reviewed on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>All of these positive developments must be balanced against protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, which is a feature of all visa regimes worldwide.  All visa applications must be assessed carefully to determine, as far as possible, that applicants will abide by the conditions of their visas and will not become a burden on the State.  These concerns apply most pertinently in cases where elderly relatives are seeking to visit their relations in Ireland, a common feature of visa applications from China.  Such applications are not straightforward and present difficult issues that all countries must address.  Nevertheless, the 95% approval rate for visa applications from China demonstrates that the checks and safeguards in place allow, in the long run, for the vast majority of persons seeking to visit their relatives to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400038#UU00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1372950000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.

The shocking revelations on the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme about the inspection procedures in cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities throughout the country appalled the nation.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in the immediate aftermath of the programme, promised a great deal of reform and I have tabled this matter in that context.  As chairman of Leitrim county child care committee, I am aware of a vacancy and, by extension, an inherent flaw in the inspection system in the county, which is also the case in other counties.  In this instance, there has been a public health nurse vacancy for some time.  The reason, I understand, is the Government embargo.  If the Government parties are serious about ensuring an open, transparent and effective inspection regime, they need to move rapidly to appoint people to fill these vacancies.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation recently announced that it would not allow any of its members to be reassigned to these positions where they were required.  It is asking the Government, as I am, to take the necessary steps to ensure the appointments are made.<\/p><p>The public health nurse inspections are serious and significant.  They complement those of the environmental inspection officers by ensuring there is proper liaison between the children and child care workers.  They also ensure there is discussion and liaison on the curriculum.  All of these issues have come to the surface in the aftermath of the television programme.  I will not labour this matter, as it is self-explanatory.  I would like to establish when the Government will make these appointments and its policy on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400040#RR00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1372950900,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The delivery of a sustainable community nursing service that effectively meets the health needs of the population within a primary care setting is the primary aim of the public health nursing service.  Public health nurses in County Leitrim provide services across all care groups within the designated area and include universal, maternal, child health and child welfare services, focusing on the health and well-being of mothers and children and developmental screening of children from birth to preschool age; services for older people and people with disabilities, involving work with individuals-families-carers to carry out an assessment of need to plan, co-ordinate, deliver or monitor a range of nursing, personal and social care services; and primary care nursing services for people under 65 years of age, which involve assessment and the provision of essential clinical nursing care, as required; health education and health promotion activities for all care groups providing advice and support.<\/p><p>The public health nurses work in collaboration with other professionals within the primary care team and also link and work with voluntary and statutory agencies in providing a range of health education and health promotion programmes that support families and communities in the promotion and maintenance of healthy lifestyles within their geographical areas, as required.

The shocking revelations on the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme about the inspection procedures in cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities throughout the country appalled the nation.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in the immediate aftermath of the programme, promised a great deal of reform and I have tabled this matter in that context.  As chairman of Leitrim county child care committee, I am aware of a vacancy and, by extension, an inherent flaw in the inspection system in the county, which is also the case in other counties.  In this instance, there has been a public health nurse vacancy for some time.  The reason, I understand, is the Government embargo.  If the Government parties are serious about ensuring an open, transparent and effective inspection regime, they need to move rapidly to appoint people to fill these vacancies.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation recently announced that it would not allow any of its members to be reassigned to these positions where they were required.  It is asking the Government, as I am, to take the necessary steps to ensure the appointments are made.<\/p><p>The public health nurse inspections are serious and significant.  They complement those of the environmental inspection officers by ensuring there is proper liaison between the children and child care workers.  They also ensure there is discussion and liaison on the curriculum.  All of these issues have come to the surface in the aftermath of the television programme.  I will not labour this matter, as it is self-explanatory.  I would like to establish when the Government will make these appointments and its policy on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400042#RR00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1372951800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The delivery of a sustainable community nursing service that effectively meets the health needs of the population within a primary care setting is the primary aim of the public health nursing service.

Currently, following a number of Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reports, it is under increasing pressure to maintain the complement of respite care within the hospital together with catering for the long-term patient care.<\/p><p>HIQA has identified a number of issues which the hospital must deal with, but these issues primarily pertain to the high level of admissions into the hospital last year, at over 700.  Approximately 80% of those admissions were for respite care and HIQA is of the view that, given the high level of admissions and discharges, the hospital needs additional staffing to meet the demands of the long-term stay patients in the hospital.  To cut a long story short, additional staff are required at the hospital.  However, the moratorium on recruitment in the public sector is causing difficulties in this regard.  Unless that is dealt with in the community nursing homes throughout the country, these difficulties will continue indefinitely.  Obviously there are issues regarding the structure of the building and the need to develop it, but that can be done at a later stage.  The most urgent matter at present is the need to lift the moratorium on recruitment for the nursing units in community hospitals throughout the country, including St. Joseph's, as well as those in Carndonagh and Dungloe in Donegal which were discussed in this Chamber last night.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will give an indication of whether he is willing to consider lifting the moratorium on recruitment or providing some level of flexibility in the moratorium for the community hospital sector.  According to the Health Service Executive, HSE, approximately 2.4% of the population aged more than 65 years is currently in nursing units.  That will increase to almost 4% in ten years.  If that is the case, what plan does the Department have in place to meet the increasing demand?  There will be a requirement for additional staff if that demand is to be met.  In addition, there will be a need for additional capacity in terms of new beds and facilities.  However, the issue tonight is the need to lift the moratorium on recruitment.  I thank the Minister for attending to reply on this Adjournment matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400043#SS00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1372952400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme.  In 2012, with a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, financial support was provided to over 22,000 people in nursing homes.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar.  As the Senator is aware, these are challenging times for the HSE in respect of all services.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard, all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and Government policy to reduce the numbers employed in the public sector.  This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole-time equivalents.  Staff appointments may be made only where an inescapable service need has been identified and which cannot be addressed by other means, such as the redeployment of staff or reorganisation of services.  The recently concluded Haddington Road agreement has increased the working week of nurses to 39 hours from 37.5 and also provided for increased hours for all other staff who were working less than a 39 hour week.  This will have the effect of increasing the overall staff capacity available to management to deploy in service delivery.<\/p><p>St. Joseph's Community Hospital was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority in June 2012.  The registration period is for three years and the current capacity is 75 beds.  The hospital provides a range of services, including respite, rehabilitation, palliative and intermediate care and there are 27 beds available for long-term residential care.  Day services are available from Monday to Friday and this supports the discharge planning processes at the hospital.  Older persons can avail of personal care, assistance with medical care and meal provision.  This provides respite to relatives and carers on a sessional basis up to five days a week.<\/p><p>The hospital was last inspected by HIQA in April 2013.  Concerns were expressed regarding the complexity of the mix of residents and the level of activity within the unit.  While the inspectors observed that staff provided care in acknowledgeable, competent and respectful manner, there was a concern that this complex mix of residents can make it more difficult for the staff to meet the needs of long-term residents.  To address this issue, the Barnes View ward has now been designated for long-stay residents only.  Dedicated staff have been assigned to the ward, which opened on 10 June last.  I am confident that this response will facilitate improved compliance with national standards.<\/p><p>Arising from this reconfiguration, staff reassignments and revised rosters were required.  These changes have been agreed and the revised rosters implemented with effect from 24 June.  When all changes have been completed St. Joseph's will have an operational capacity of 67 beds, including the 27 long-stay beds.  Residents and their families can be assured that management and staff will continue to work to provide the highest standards of care at St. Joseph's.  The HSE has asked me to assure the House that the residents are receiving a safe and quality service.  Bed capacity across all community hospitals in Donegal will be kept under ongoing review.  However, although the moratorium on recruitment remains in place, there are no current plans to further reduce bed capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400043#SS00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372952400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>To be honest, whoever drafted that response does not answer the question.  The line, \"Bed capacity across all community hospitals in Donegal will be kept under ongoing review\", is an insult to the communities in Donegal.  Every community group in Donegal that is connected to a hospital is already doing that.  Anybody can keep the bed capacity under review.  The Minister said the moratorium on recruitment will not be lifted, therefore the problem will not be resolved.  I realise the Minister is new to the Department and that he has conviction and passion, but I plead with him to look again at this issue.  It is a train coming down the tracks that will go off the rails unless it is dealt with.  The Minister should meet with the troika and tell it in no uncertain terms that there must be flexibility here.

I know some efforts have been made to change the visa regime, which has for a long time caused difficulties for Chinese people who wanted to visit Ireland.  <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, better systems in the United Kingdom have the consequence of putting people off from coming here, reducing investment in the country and tourist numbers.  Efforts have been made to reform the system and there has been much bilateral contact between Ireland and China, to which the Cathaoirleach recently led a delegation, of which my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, was part.  Some work has been done to change some of the more restrictive systems and make sure Chinese visitors to the United Kingdom are able to travel onwards to Ireland without applying separately.  However, there is still huge room for improvement.  Up to 2 million Chinese tourists visit Europe each year, of whom only 10,000 come to Ireland.  Given the attractiveness of this country, its sites and the rave reviews, it is a shame more visitors do not come here.  In a  poll in <i>The China Post<\/i>Chinese visitors who had visited Ireland rated it the most attractive destination in Europe.<\/p><p> I understand there are difficulties with the visa regime which put people off.  Chinese nationals living in Ireland have difficulty in arranging for family members to visit them.  I was recently contacted by a Chinese businesswoman who runs a business in Drumcondra.  She has been here for 11 years and has an Irish passport, as do her husband and children, yet she has difficulty in arranging for her parents to visit her and see their grandchildren.  They are retired and have sufficient resources to travel anywhere in the world and would like to see their grandchildren in Ireland.  However, every time they wish to do so, they must go through a cumbersome visa application process involving many documents and delays while waiting for an answer.  Just because one has been approved once does not mean the same will happen the second time.  This causes difficulties in booking flights, making arrangements and knowing the dates they will be in Ireland.<\/p><p> I have written to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the immigration office about the case.  I know the Minister of State cannot comment on individual cases, but I wanted to highlight the general difficulty because Ireland has a huge Chinese population.  We need to look at the arrangements made in other countries to make it easier for family visitors to come to visit family members and children who live in Ireland or for people to come as tourists and spend money here.  People applying for visas are well able to look after themselves and will make a major economic contribution here for a few weeks.  We should be doing everything possible to encourage them to come here.  We need a robust immigration system, but it appears to be overly cumbersome, which is a shame.  I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister the need to address these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400044#TT00700","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372953600,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Senator for raising this issue.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to update the House on the numerous positive developments that have taken place in the Irish visa regime since the Government came to power and, in particular, developments in respect of visitors from China.  <\/p><p>The commitment of the Government to the facilitation and growth in the number of visits to Ireland from China is shown by the fact that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of the Department maintains a dedicated visa office in Beijing.  In general, business visas are processed within two to five working days of receipt of applications, while visit visa applications for Chinese nationals are processed within one to three weeks.  The approval rate for visa applications lodged in China for travel to Ireland is 95%, which compares favourably internationally.  Application guidelines for all visa categories are published on the Irish Embassy website in English and Chinese.  Applications for visas for Ireland are made online using a user-friendly web-based form.  This is in contrast with many visa regimes which require the completion of lengthy paper application forms.<\/p><p>There is no evidence that the visa process is a barrier to tourist, business or family visits from China to Ireland.  In fact, the latest report of the European Tour Operators Association which examined the effect of visa obligations on tourists from India and China covering the year 2010 showed that the figure for cancellations owing to perceived visa delays reflected very favourably on Ireland, with only 15% of clients reporting cancellations, as against 21% for the Schengen area and 24% for the United Kingdom.  This demonstrates that Ireland is not at a disadvantage against its main competitors owing to any issue with perceived delays in visa processing.  The Minister is advised that the checking procedures and processes in place are at least on a par with those in the United Kingdom, with which we share a common immigration area, and less onerous than those in place for many other EU member states.  Of far greater impact on both tourist and business visits is the lack of a direct air link between the two countries.  If the Senator has a particular case in mind or has suggestions to further improve the situation, while maintaining sensible immigration checks, the Minister would be glad to receive them.<\/p><p>The Minister launched the short stay visa waiver programme, the first of its kind in the history of the State, on 1 July 2011.  This allows visitors or business people, including those from China, who have lawfully entered the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  CSO figures for the numbers of trips by Chinese nationals to Ireland show that there was a 24% increase in the 12 months following the introduction of the waiver programme compared to the 12 months before.  This demonstrates the positive impact of the Government's initiative.<\/p><p>With effect from 1 August 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other visitors was implemented in the Irish visa office in Beijing.  The regime has been extended to regular family visitors with a good immigration history.  The Minister has asked his officials to examine how this regime could be further developed.  In recognition of the growing number of affluent and independent tourists from China, a scheme to enable independent Chinese travellers to come to Ireland was introduced in November 2011.  The category was formally launched by the Taoiseach during the course of his official visit to China in April 2012.  The visa application requirements for independent tourists are minimal and I am informed that Tourism Ireland has welcomed this initiative.  This category of visa application is processed within ten working days.<\/p><p>With regard to Chinese nationals visiting Ireland for study purposes, in 2012 a pilot programme in respect of English language study was developed jointly between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and Marketing English in Ireland, the umbrella body for English language schools, for the Chinese market.  The programme seeks to target high quality, motivated English language students and aims to develop the market in a sustainable way.  The programme is designed to significantly contribute to the development of Ireland's reputation as a premier destination for Chinese students to achieve a high standard in English language education.  The programmes are at an early stage and it is important that they be given sufficient time to grow and develop before a final review is undertaken.  However, progress under these programmes is reviewed on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>All of these positive developments must be balanced against protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, which is a feature of all visa regimes worldwide.  All visa applications must be assessed carefully to determine, as far as possible, that applicants will abide by the conditions of their visas and will not become a burden on the State.  These concerns apply most pertinently in cases where elderly relatives are seeking to visit their relations in Ireland, a common feature of visa applications from China.  Such applications are not straightforward and present difficult issues that all countries must address.  Nevertheless, the 95% approval rate for visa applications from China demonstrates that the checks and safeguards in place allow, in the long run, for the vast majority of persons seeking to visit their relatives to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013070400045#UU00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1372953600,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.

As I said, I have written to the Minister to provide details of the individual case I am referring to.  I will follow that up.

We should not make it overly cumbersome for them to do so.  I appreciate the opportunity to have this debate.  I note that there have been many positive developments over the past couple of years.

A number of initiatives in this area have been introduced by the present Government and its predecessor.  They are monitored regularly and constantly to see if there is room for improvement.  All of this work is leading to better understanding and co-operation between two ancient countries, Ireland and China.  I am absolutely delighted that the Taoiseach and others have been to China.
