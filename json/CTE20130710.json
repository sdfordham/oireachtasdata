In view of the importance we attach to the issue of youth unemployment, we decided to submit a political contribution on our position to the Presidents of the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the European Commission.  Within the overall challenge presented by unemployment, youth unemployment has the potential to cause the widest social and economic damage to society.  Accordingly, the course of action proposed by the European Commission, through the youth guarantee, is most welcome.  Youth guarantee schemes have a proven record in assisting people to find employment and training or education courses, thus reducing the economic and social burden of unemployment.  It is important that the youth guarantee be properly funded and fully implemented through the European Union.  For this reason, the European Commission's proposal that aims to provide matching funding from the European Social Fund for the youth employment initiative is welcome.  It is important that all member states fund the youth guarantee, to the maximum extent, in order to draw down as much matching funding as possible.  The political contribution the committee proposes to adopt will convey to the institutions of the European Union the importance that we attach to the youth guarantee.  I wish to see it implemented fully and speedily throughout the European Union.  Is the political contribution agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000003#D00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pre-Budget Consultation Process: Discussion with Minister for Social Protection","time":1373446800,"counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000003#D00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and thank her for joining us.

The Minister raised a number of issues.  I was interested in the last point on the Keynesian model which we have discussed before.  Social welfare acts as a stimulus to the local economy, as well as a support for those who depend on it.  However, the corollary is that if there is any cut to it, in any shape or form, this also has an effect on the local economy.  The cuts in social welfare in previous years and next year of &euro;400 million or so will obviously have a negative impact not only on those who have become dependent on social welfare or who need it as a support but also on local economies.<\/p><p>  The Minister has stated that at the height of the boom between 2004 and 2007 the share of households defined as jobless shockingly recorded a double digit increase to reach 15%.  Is that 15% of the number unemployed or 15% of society?  If it is the number of unemployed, the number has, in fact, dropped.  It could be a greater percentage of a lower number.<\/p><p>  I refer to processing times which we have debated in the context of family income supplement.  Everybody who has applied for family income supplement will be delighted that the processing times have been reduced.  However, the processing times and appeal times for medical claimants are still quite high, especially for those applying for carer's allowance.  Given the distress the families concerned are often in because of medical circumstances, what steps can be taken to address the delay?  Some 50% of decisions on medical claims which are rejected are overturned on appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000005#F00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1373447700,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation.

She mentioned the basic rate and how important it was in tackling poverty.  Does she agree that when one maintains the basic rate of social welfare, it acts as a basic underlayer for the economy, which benefits everybody because everybody's wage rate in the economy is based on the lowest level?  When one maintains the lowest level in the social welfare system, everybody in the economy benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000005#F00400","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373448300,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I would like to begin by responding to Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh's comment on the numbers of families in which no adult in the household has a significant amount of work, which is generally defined as less than ten hours a week of paid work.  I will send the exact technical definition to the Deputy.  This recognised measure of deprivation has become a very important social indicator in recent years.  It is now used by the ESRI which has worked on a couple of papers on the issue in recent years.  I invite members to envisage a family in which none of the three adults of working age - between 18 years and the pension age of 66 - has a significant level of work.  One or more of them might have a low level of work, which is defined as up to ten hours a week.  The children in these households are at risk of intergenerational unemployment because there is no role model in the household who goes to work.  In the social studies of this issue that I have read many commentators have suggested these children are particularly at risk.  This can be linked with the point Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was making on communities being particularly affected.  We have worked to identify communities in which there is a significant number of households in which all of the adults are jobless.  The children in these households are very much at risk.<\/p><p>  I was asked what the Department could do as it changed from a passive to an active role.  We have assumed responsibility for the community employment scheme.  As Minister, I have introduced two new schemes, T&uacute;s and JobBridge.  I launched the JobsPlus scheme in Waterford the day before yesterday.  Under this scheme, an employer who takes on a person who has been unemployed for one year will be given back &euro;7,500 in cash on a monthly basis over a two-year period.  If the employer takes on a person who has been on the live register for two years or more, he or she will be given back &euro;10,000 in cash on a monthly basis over a two-year period.  The community employment schemes represent one of the reasons I made a case to my Government colleagues in advance of last year's budget.  The economy has three really big issues - unemployment, debt distress and the failure of the banks to make credit available to small and medium-sized enterprises.  They are our three biggest problems.  We also have a major problem as we try to get back to the international markets in order that we can borrow money at a reasonable rate.  We have to take these balances into account.<\/p><p>  I was urged to consider the effects of these payments on families and communities.  Community employment schemes and the T&uacute;s scheme are really important because they allow families in which the adults may be jobless to participate in their own communities.  I think most people here would know that tremendously positive and good work is being done.  Last year I gave money from my budget to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for area-based approaches to child poverty, even though my budget was facing the kind of financial pressure about which we have been talking.  I am happy to report that when the first sample of youth unemployment schemes was examined last week, my Department came in strongly behind Ballymun's application to be the first youth guarantee programme area.  As an initial piece of work, all of the agencies in the Ballymun area will be brought together to work with young people.  When I visited the area last Thursday or Friday, I met young people who were involved in and participating in these programmes.  I received positive feedback about the effect they could have on young people from jobless households and who were not working.<\/p><p>  I was also asked about processing times.  I am happy to say that as in the case of family income supplement, there are no backlogs with regard to carers.  They are up to date.  The critical issue is whether people give all of the information required in support of their claims at the time when they submit their claims.  Just this week, a Deputy who is not present at this meeting made a query about a family on the basis that the mother was not in receipt of rent supplement.  When we examined the case, we found that the person in question had not yet made an application to the Department.  We had to tell the Deputy that the person in question was not being prevented in any way from receiving rent supplement.  We said we could not advance the matter in the absence of an application.  People are working with us to make sure the applications are made and are as complete as possible.<\/p><p>  I accept that the basic rates are really important.  I remind the committee that when I introduced my first general social welfare Bill as Minister, I reversed the reduction that had been made in the minimum wage.  The country needs a framework that gives jobless families the capacity to have a living wage.  A living wage consists of two elements, the first of which is the minimum wage.  In Ireland the minimum wage is relatively high compared to the provision made in many other countries in Europe.  The other aspect of the living wage is that if one does not have enough hours, one will not have enough income.  That is why an employer who wishes to benefit from the JobsPlus scheme which I launched in Waterford on Monday will be required to give the employee at least 30 hours of work a week.  <\/p><p>  One of the points that was repeatedly stressed by the groups I met on Friday was that these issues should be considered on a cross-government basis.  As we have mentioned, the economic impact of social welfare expenditure should be examined.  Equally, the impact of changes across the areas of government should be examined.  That is certainly another issue to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000006#G00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373448300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

At the same time, she has indicated that she wants to maintain core payments.  This really means that supplementary payments which are paid to those who are most vulnerable will have to be cut.  I refer to disability payments, carer's payments and old age pensions.  If supplementary payments are to be targeted for cutbacks, it will not look well.<\/p><p>  I compliment and commend the Minister on the introduction of the JobsPlus programme.

For employers, this means that they are not just taking somebody who has been unemployed for two years or more.  The people concerned might have been participants in a scheme and that is taken into account.  I would like to see employers appreciating the work people do and the contribution they make if they are participating in a well-run community employment scheme.  Community employment now lasts for a period of 18 months and we have developed a positive relationship with those running schemes.  We are trying to expand the number of schemes available, but there is a difficulty in that regard owing to the difficulty with Garda vetting.  Otherwise we could have activated up to 3,000 more people.  Members of the committee will appreciate that in a community environment for the majority of positions available, particularly those dealing with children or vulnerably adults, Garda vetting of participants is required.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is working on this issue.

Over 18,000 people have participated in the JobBridge programme since it started.  At any one time there are approximately 6,000 people participating in it.  Indecon carried out a study which indicated that five months after people had completed the JobBridge programme, 60% of those who were graduates had found work.  In the case of non-graduates, the rate was over 50%.  In the context of job placement schemes, this is among the highest levels of job placement in Europe.  Employers have been very surprised by the calibre of the employees recruited.  One of the most important aspects of the JobBridge programme has been the message it has sent regarding the quality of people available, who through no fault of their own had lost their jobs.  In the three years after the bank guarantee the economy lost 250,000 jobs.  We literally fell off a cliff in terms of employment.<\/p><p>  On the question raised by Deputy Brendan Griffin, the sustainability of the social welfare budget can be seen in two ways.  In terms of individuals and communities, the more people we get back to work, the less pressure there will be on the social welfare system.  Also, as the economy grows, the social welfare spend of &euro;20 billion will decrease in real terms.  For example, if the economy increases from a figure of &euro;100 billion to &euro;120 billion, at &euro;20 billion, the social welfare spend will reduce as a percentage.  As economists say, if we can get people back to work, the deficit will begin to drop rapidly.  I agree that a spend of 40% of Government spending on social welfare is high, but it is keeping the country going.  The way to reduce it is to grow the economy and get people back to work.  Every time we get somebody back to work, the social welfare costs, amounting to a minimum of &euro;12,000 and up to &euro;20,000 for a family, are removed.  The family in question gradually begins to pay PRSI and, ultimately, tax.  <\/p><p>  One of the major benefits of creating employment in the economy is that confidence increases and people with savings begin to spend.  There is considerable saving in the economy.  Many people are paying down debt, but they are also saving because at the back of their minds there is a concern that they may need savings because their job may not be totally secure.  The creation of employment brings an increase in consumer confidence and encourages more spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000007#H00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373448900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Deputy Brendan Griffin asked whether the Department could make the cuts of &euro;440 million without touching weekly rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000007#H00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1373448900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I certainly hope so, but at the end of the day, budgetary decisions are for the whole Government to make.

It is quite an improvement in terms of identity verification.  The Senator might be familiar with the photographs taken at airport security points and so on.  If a person has been visiting the social welfare office in Ballymun, the IT system will tell us if he or she has also been visiting the office in Blanchardstown.

It is hoped 2,500 places is a starter number.  We have to provide an indicative budget and there is a cap on it.  If an employer provides employment in excess of 30 hours a week, the person concerned is taken off social welfare.  Having a single person employed will mean a reduction in cost to the Department of &euro;188 a week, with any other benefits payable to the person.  It is a win for him or her because he or she is employed; it is a win for the employer because he or she receives cash back from the Department; and it is win for broader society because we are helping to boost the economy.<\/p><p>  We began with an indicative figure for the T&uacute;s and JobBridge programmes.  Some 13 local authorities have agreed to be part of the first wave of the initiative and the selection of participants is under way in the Department.  The local authorities will carry out their own recruitment processes.  In some cases, there will be a need for Garda vetting.  Nearly 3,000 people are available to be placed on various departmental schemes such as the community employment scheme, but the Garda vetting process is delaying their placement.  The delay currently is 14 weeks.  The caveat is that in some instances the local authorities may require Garda vetting.  They have identified 700 posts to be filled before the end of September.  I would be very happy to implement the suggestion to provide a greater financial incentive.  However, the Minister for Finance places restrictions on what Departments spend.  I, therefore, suggest the Deputy might have that conversation with him.<\/p><p>  Many men worked all hours in the construction industry during the boom period and made good money.  In many cases, their world of work came to a halt.  The Deputy will know that many of them went home to family farms because there was nothing for them to do.  Many young single men emigrated.  I hope the local authorities' social employment scheme, the JobPath scheme, will provide an opportunity for the people concerned to become re-engaged.  There will be work available of interest to former construction workers.  It will enable them to provide a significant service for their local community and be well regarded by it, as is the case with community employment scheme participants.  I am hopeful this scheme will be a success.  It has taken the local authorities an amount of time to flesh out the details, but they have given me an undertaking that the scheme will commence soon.

It is a short scheme designed to give people a kick-start where they have a particular qualification but are unable to gain work experience in the economy.  People who gain decent work experience under the scheme have something substantial to include in their CV and present to potential employers.  In fact, the evidence shows that, in many cases, they are retained by the host organisation.  In the case of a small business, for example, there might be an intention to take on an additional employee at some time, but the decision is only really made when the owner or manager sees how a particular individual can add value to the business.<\/p><p>  In the case of community employment schemes and T&uacute;s, on the other hand, the objective is that people have an educational and training experience that will result in their obtaining qualifications and certifications which will make them more attractive to prospective employers.  For instance, my Department has been working very diligently all year to devise an educational programme for child care and other care areas.  My ambition is that everybody who takes up a place under that programme will emerge with at least a FETAC level 5 qualification.  It is a combination of qualification plus hands-on child care experience in a properly supervised environment.  Community cr&egrave;ches have a very good structure of management, as anybody who is familiar with them will know.  If we have the certification and education process alongside the work experience element, we will, at the end of the process, have a person who is very employable.  Many participants in the scheme will go on to obtain employment through the Department's community support programmes, under which we support the social economy throughout the country in different areas.  Some might go on to become assistant supervisors or supervisors in a community-based facility, which is a good employment outcome in itself.<\/p><p>  In regard to the local authority scheme, I have been saying to managers that I would like to see participants being considered for local authority vacancies as they arise.  In the cycle of time, we envisage that people who partake in the scheme will be in a good position to secure employment in local government services.  I have yet to see exactly what types of employment opportunities the local authorities have in mind.  We are looking to countries such as Finland and Sweden as an example, both of which also experienced major bank crashes, although admittedly not as disastrous as ours or as disastrously handled in the form of the bank guarantee.  One of the elements that comes through strongly in the initiatives in these countries, as it does in all of the discussions in Europe on the youth guarantee, is that it simply makes enormous sense for the State to invest in people's education and training.<\/p><p>  In all cases, whether it be the community employment, T&uacute;s or local authority scheme, the ultimate objective is to put in place a developmental path for the individual.  Participants are contributing and participating in work that is of benefit to their community, the payback to them being that they acquire work experience, while also enjoying an investment in their education and training.  Since taking over this whole area my officials and I have been learning as we go along in the case of JobBridge and T&uacute;s.  In the case of community employment schemes our focus is on putting in place a robust framework.  The work is mostly done on the child care programme, as I said, which will see people emerging after two to three years of community employment experience with a FETAC level 5 qualification.  That is the model I wish to employ because it offers a huge plus for individuals and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000010#L00800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373450700,"counter":66,"content":"<p>On the general budget, my understanding is that an overall reduction of &euro;610 million is required, but some of this will be accounted for by savings accruing from previous budget changes.

The 2014 expenditure ceiling - this is something of a technical public accounting mechanism - for my Department, as included in the papers published by the Department of Finance, will be &euro;610 million lower than it is this year.  In Government accounting one has revenue which is money coming in and expenditure which is the cash that goes out.  The basic structure is that the ceiling will be &euro;610 million lower next year.  The Deputy is correct to state the ask will be &euro;440 million because there are carryover measures and changes which include some of the savings made.  As we have just been discussing, however, we must also be aware of the enormous impact on the system of the very large numbers of people, particularly jobseekers, seeking social welfare payments.  I have stated there are a couple of variables.  In the context of the number of pensioners, more people are retiring and they are also living longer.  The impact of this in each of the past three years has been a figure of approximately 3%.  The impact will continue to be felt for a further period.  Even if nothing else was happening, the Department would be obliged to find just under &euro;200 million per year in order to provide for retired citizens.  This is due to the way in which the structure of the population is changing.<\/p><p>  When we entered office, the numbers on the live register were heading towards 14.7% or 14.8%.  The figure is now down to approximately 13.6%.  The numbers have decreased and, therefore, some of the pressure on the live register has eased, which is something of a gain.  While pensions are a cost, reductions in the live register represent an enormous gain.  As stated, we are also spending more on employment supports.  In the context of the &euro;440 million to which the Deputy refers, we must consider the population demand.  The critical aspect in this regard is the number who are unemployed.  The major point I make to my colleagues in the Government is that we must get more people back to work.  While Ireland is doing very well in attracting foreign direct investment, the jobs to which such investment gives rise do not - as I stated during the discussion with Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - necessarily benefit those areas and communities with the highest percentages of jobless households, families and individuals.  Obviously, that is the really important aspect and it is a matter for the Departments with responsibility in the area of economics.  I continually put forward my opinion that employment creation should remain the focus of the Government's ambitions.  The more people we can get back into employment, the less pressure there will be on the &euro;440 million to which Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh refers.  There is also an economic argument in respect of this money.  In previous years I have been able to negotiate the position downwards by making the kind of arguments members have brought forward.<\/p><p>  I saw part of the documentary last night on the free travel scheme.  We co-operate strongly with Dublin Bus, CIE and Veolia which operates Luas.  As stated, we run a lot of multi-agency operations.  However, I accept that there is a problem with the free travel scheme being abused.  Last year when there was a great deal of discussion of this matter, I stated the problem did not relate to retired people or pensioners.  There are many other categories of individual who are entitled to free travel.  I refer to those who have companion passes and those with disabilities who can also avail of free travel passes.  We have in place a hotline by means of which all of the travel companies may contact the Department.  If a passenger presents what is supposed to be the current form of pass but which an employee of one of the companies believes to be forged, he or she can ring the hotline to check the name and number on the pass.  In the clip from the documentary which I saw last night a guy was shown ringing the Department of Social Protection.  We put that system in place.<\/p><p>  Rolling out the personal services card is going to be critical.  We hope to roll it out, in some cases, to retired people and pensioners this year.  The cards will bear the legend \"FT\" which stands for free travel and biometric pictures of the owners will also be printed on them.  Obviously, we will require technological co-operation in this regard from the transport companies and post offices.  I am delighted to inform the committee - I had not yet made the announcement in this regard when I previously came before it - that An Post is the preferred bidder for the cash delivery services for the Department.  It is a major employer in both rural and urban areas.  I would like the company to use information technology to verify and authenticate people's identities.  It already does much important work for us in this regard.  If a person frequents his or her local post office, the people who work there will get to know him or her.  In such circumstances and if a person's brother, cousin or someone else comes in his or her stead, then they are likely to be able to detect this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000011#M00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373451300,"counter":72,"content":"<p>As Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh inquired, does the Department have the facility to sue or pursue people for identity theft?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000011#M00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1373451300,"counter":73,"content":"<p>If someone is found to be behaving in a fraudulent manner, his or her benefit will be suspended almost immediately.

I want to stop all of what is going on in this regard because it is undermining the free travel scheme for pensioners.  The scheme is cherished and valued and the Department makes an extremely important subvention or payment to CIE in respect of it.  I understand it is worth approximately &euro;75 million per year to the company.  That is a big spend and we do not want it to be undermined.  We are obliged to wait for the OPW to roll out the IT required and convert the offices for which it has responsibility.  If this can be done as fast as possible, we can issue many more cards.  I hope that by the end of the year we will have been able to issue up to 600,000.  It is going very well.  We also have an arrangement with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of those who are retired and in possession of passports.

I appreciate what the Minister stated about the Nordic countries.  My wife is from that part of the world and I am extremely familiar with the ethos in these countries in the context of training provision and learning.<\/p> <p>I accept that education and training are not the responsibility of the Minister's Department and neither is job creation.  I commend the Department on the broad view it is taking in that it is not only issuing cheques but, progressively and productively, it is making sure that people are upskilling and it is giving them every opportunity to so do.  I genuinely commend the move by the Minister's Department in that direction as well as the job creation aspect of it.  <\/p><p> One of the biggest challenges facing a local authority such as Cork County Council, and I know the same challenge does not face the Dublin local authorities, is road maintenance.  There is a great opportunity for the Jobstart scheme to assist in addressing this issue.  The reality is that there will be very little upskilling for people who engage in that type of manual work.  Roads may not be an issue for the Dublin local authorities.  It is important to recognise the opportunity to assist in this respect with some financial recompense as opposed to simply saying that these people will benefit because the reality is that they will not.  People are happy to partake in manual work and there may not be upskilling opportunities for them.  That is my motivation in raising this issue and I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion.<\/p><p> We have briefing material on \"Ensuring Work Pays\" from the Department, but it is quite basic.  Employers tell us that they cannot get people to take up jobs and that they have advertised them but have not had success.  The Minister will have heard all these stories and I will not bore her by repeating them.  I would be interested in getting more information on this area from the Department.  I agree that many of these claims are myths but it is hard to convince employers that people are not better off not working and that they are not all at home, drawing every benefit under the sun, with no interest in working and having a great life.  I note the Minister's figure that 74% claim for themselves only.  Would the Department be willing to give us a few case studies of families, for example, Mr. A, who is 42 years old and married with three children, and the sum total of benefits he gets.  It is an educational adventure we have to go on and we have to let the employers know that there is a happy medium and that the reality is different from the perception that prevails.  That perception needs to be challenged and we as members have a responsibility to challenge it.  I would appreciate any assistance we could get from the Department on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000011#M00500","speaker":"994","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373451900,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Cork County Council and Cork City Council have committed to take on 60 people each on the first stage of the Jobpath.  We have had very good co-operation from them.  In terms of Cork city and county, approximately 6,000 people are participating in a variety of schemes supported by my Department, including community employment, in which there are a few thousand participants.  More than 2,000 participants are engaged in community employment and more than 2,000 are participating in the back to education allowance scheme in Cork city and county.  Nearly 1,000 people are participating in the back to work scheme.  Cork has a strong participance rate in these schemes.  As the Deputy will know, I have had an opportunity to visit quite a number of community employment schemes in different parts of Cork city and county.  This is a developmental process.  As the economy recovers and we have space in the budget, I hope it will be possible to increase the incentives.  Participants are offered 19 hours a week on the scheme I mentioned.  The opportunities for people to train and on the vocational developmental side and the education side are good.<\/p><p>  On the issue of ensuring work pays and the Deputy's example of a family of, say, two adults and three children, roughly 74%, or 317,000 people, claim for themselves alone.  In other words, they have no dependants.  They get &euro;188 a week and if they are long-term employed they also get the fuel allowance.  Some 5%, or 22,000 people, are couples who have no children, 4% are couples with one child, and 9%, or 40,000 people, are couples with two or more children.  It is among that latter group, particularly if one has a rent supplement, that there is a strong potential for people to be unemployed or to fall into the poverty trap.  If a family of two adults and three children have a rent supplement, the rent levels in Cork for a three of four bed-roomed house, depending on the part of the county or city one is living in, could be anything from &euro;900 to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 a month.  The Deputy can do the maths.  If one is getting social welfare benefits for a family of five and one is getting the back to school allowance and all the other allowances, the benefits could mount up to close to &euro;30,000 and if one adds to that an average of &euro;1,000 a month for rent supplement, then would bring the package of benefits up to over the &euro;40,000 mark.  We have done those figures and we do them regularly, and I can send them to the Deputy.  It means that for somebody to take up a job, he or she has to get that amount, but if one takes a job paying &euro;42,000 or &euro;38,000, one will also pay some PRSI and a small amount in taxation.  One will retain child benefit and one's medical card for three years if one has been long-term unemployed.  There is a bit of a myth that one will lose it, but that is not true.  Employers seem to believe that as much as people who are unemployed.<\/p><p>  If members come across people like that, they should let the local social welfare office know and also ask the employers to let the local social welfare office know.  We have a social contract with people who are unemployed.  We will support them with income support and do everything we can to help them to get back to work, but they have a social obligation to the wider Irish society to take up reasonable offers of work.  That is what the whole activation process is about.  We have an obligation to assist the person who has unfortunately become unemployed but they have social obligations, a social contract, to the wider society to make themselves available for work.  It would be very helpful to us if employers would let us know if they have make reasonable offers of a job and cannot find anybody to take it up.  As we work through the Intreo process, if an employer says he or she wants two people to work at X, we can look at the profiling we are doing and see if we have some people who fit that profile.  It is then up to the employer to interview those people and possibly offer them a job, and we will expect people to take reasonable offers.<\/p><p> To return to the housing supplement issue, that is the critical and main reason I would like that scheme to be transferred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If an individual is on the local authority rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or on the traditional social housing rented scheme, that person and their family would be on a differential rent.  If that person is in receipt of social welfare, they would be able to calculate what they have to contribute in terms of social welfare income into the house.  If that person is then offered a job, they can do the calculation, and the council would do it for them, of what the differential rent would go up to if they took up the job.  The rent supplement scheme in the Department of Social Protection was designed, and this is provided in law, as being only a temporary support while somebody is out of work.  That is the legal basis of the scheme.  If a person takes up a job while being on rent supplement, and Deputy Jim Daly gave the example of a family of five, the rent could easily be &euro;1,000 a month plus.  That family has to make up that &euro;12,000 of rent and that is where the poverty trap lies, because they will lose that support.  If the scheme were transferred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, such a person in the future would only pay an enhanced differential rent.  The extra cost to that person might be only an amount of &euro;20 to &euro;30 a week because that is the way local authority differential rents work.  That would be a critical piece of reform.  I can brief the committee on how that reform is going but I do not know if we have the time.<\/p><p>  Pages 5 and 6 of the members' information pack sets out the data of the number of people with families who are on the live register.  I remind members that more than 90,000 families are lone-parent families but not all of them would be on the live register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000012#N00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373452500,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Members might want to move on to deal with the programmes.

I had an engagement in my constituency with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Will the Minister indicate if any changes are to be made to social protection for the self-employed this time around?  We are entering our third year in government and I am aware that reports have been commissioned.  We have yet to see those reports but we must start making decisions about the self-employed.  I am on record as saying the Minister has been very good to the self-employed in lowering the threshold to allow them to get social protection.  Based on the last figure the Minister gave, between 24,000 and 30,000 self-employed people were on social protection in the past three years but we have to look to the future and put a new system in place.  We are talking about adding another 1.5% to the 4% a self-employed person pays in terms of an S class stamp.  I welcome that because we must start to move forward in 2014 and recognise self-employed people.  I would not like anybody else to go through what I had to go through as a self-employed person when I lost my business because of the recession.  I had a young family to feed but I was not entitled to anything.  I am adamant about that.  I am sure the members are fed up listening to me talk about self-employed people in the Chamber but I would love to see some system put in place to recognise self-employed people and for the country to move forward because there is no incentive to be self-employed here.  We have to put a safety net in place to ensure that if somebody makes a go of a business, employs people and puts their heart and soul into that, they will have that safety net if they get sick, become disabled or their business fails.<\/p><p>  I plead with the Minister to start recognising self-employed people.  I know that is difficult in difficult times but my argument would be that in putting the 1.5% on to the 4% one is paying in one's business through income tax, even if one is not making a profit, one is still paying it on one's drawings.  Revenue might not like me for saying this but I would rather put something into a type of class stamp to ensure that if things go wrong, my family and me will have some protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000013#O00200","speaker":"1079"},{"type":"speech","time":1373452500,"counter":79,"content":"<p>We received a letter from the Minister's Department stating that the report on the entitlements of self-employed people in terms of social protection payments is on her desk and that she is considering it.

Almost all the 100,000 people who lost their jobs, particularly as a consequence of the collapse of the construction industry, ended up being self-employed in one way or another with the changes in construction during the height of the boom.  We have given almost all of those people access to social welfare protection.<\/p><p>  The other issue that affects people in that situation is that their partners may be working.  That would reduce the level of support they would get from this Department but the chairperson of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare was at pains to point out that self-employed people do well.  The actuarial report on the Social Insurance Fund stated specifically that 4% of self-employed people get access to retirement pensions and to widow's, widower's and survivor's pensions.  That is the best value for money in the social insurance scheme.<\/p><p>  The critical issue, and this is something that is a judgment call, is that an employed person, between him or her and the employer, is contributing 14.75%.  A self-employed person currently contributes only 4%.  We may be able to move to getting self-employed people to contribute more to get specific benefits but we will have to cover the costs.  Would people currently self-employed do that?  <\/p><p>  I strongly agree with Deputy Butler.  I know many people who became self-employed during the construction boom.  There was never a thought, understandably because they were working all the hours God sent, about whether they should be paying PRSI and a full stamp, to use the old terminology.  It was only when the boom ended that they suddenly found they did not have the protection of unemployment or jobseeker's benefit or allowances.  The question is whether people could afford to move to a higher level of contribution and the level at which that should be set.  There would also be other ways of mitigating that.  With self-employed people being very resourceful, their benefit periods might be more restricted.  <\/p><p>  I received the report recently and we are examining it in detail.  In any report on social welfare we have to examine the cost factors involved in introducing it, what people would be charged, and the benefits they would get.  We would then have to examine the system's implementation; I think the fancy name for it in the Department is the business process implementation plan.  It often means that many changes to IT are required to take account of it, and we have to plan in that regard.  We are looking at both of those and I will revert to the committee when we have had an opportunity to examine how we would go about doing this, the implications for the individual and the Department's budget, and the IT business systems that would be required to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071000013#O00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1373452500,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Regarding the pensions programme, could the Minister give us a figure for the money saved or anticipated to be saved this year from the changes to social welfare pensions in terms of the number of contributions a person has to make, the bands and so on?

In addition, the State is paying quite an amount of money abroad to people who contributed but who then emigrated.  However, going back to the additional approximately &euro;200 million per year the State is spending on people coming into the retirement income supports, one must ensure it is all funded as, otherwise, what is called a hole in the Social Insurance Fund will get bigger and bigger.  The biggest reason for the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund at present is unemployment and the amount of jobseeker's benefit the Department is paying.  However, we must close that gap because we have a contributory social welfare system and as the Deputy noted, it is important for people to have a system they can build up because private pensions from private employers, as well as those for public sector employers, also are under pressure.

I greatly appreciate members' work and look forward to receiving their report in due course.  Substantial progress has been made in terms of developing the national climate policy agenda since I met with the committee in December 2011.  Arising from that constructive meeting, I responded to a request from the committee to set out in writing the policy development agenda, issuing the programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation in January 2012.  In spite of the enormity and importance of the task, the programme is broadly on schedule.  Great credit is due to several key players, particularly this committee and the secretariat to the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.<\/p><p>  I delivered a comprehensive statement to the committee at the outset of the policy development process in December 2011.  In addition, the committee recently had a full briefing by departmental officials, the Environmental Protection Agency and the NESC secretariat.  Rather than going over the ground again and given there have been no major developments in the meantime, I propose to take this opportunity to set out the key issues in the national climate policy and legislation agenda from my perspective.<\/p><p>  First, and perhaps most important of all, is Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions profile.  That is the critical starting point.  We have a somewhat unusual profile in the European context due to several factors, including the high share of emissions associated with ruminant livestock in the agricultural sector.  This situation has not arisen because we do not have an efficiency in that sector; on the contrary, we have a carbon-efficient agriculture and food sector.  It is simply due to the scale of the industry relative to our overall economy.  In any debate on national climate policy and legislation, it is essential both to understand Ireland's emissions profile and respond specifically to it.<\/p><p>  As I said in my previous statement, the challenge we face is significant and serious and must be dealt with in a manner that has regard to our specific national circumstances.  I have heard suggestions that we should follow the policy or legislative approach taken in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom.  When I look at the latter's emissions profile, however, I see little similarity with ours.  In short, that country's challenge is very different from ours.  Lessons from other countries must certainly be considered, but it would be naive and potentially very harmful to assume that what works elsewhere provides an easy or appropriate solution for Ireland.  We must make progress on the basis of what will work best for this country in meeting its greenhouse gas mitigation obligations in the medium and long term and pursuing new growth opportunities in a low-carbon future.  We need an informed and mature response to our specific greenhouse gas mitigation challenge.<\/p><p>  The second issue I will address is the serious gap that exists in international and EU policy and legislation in terms of accounting for greenhouse gas emissions and removals of the use of certain lands, including agricultural land.  This is a critically important issue for Ireland but one which is often overlooked.  In fact, it is central to the climate policy development process as a consequence of its direct relevance to our agricultural sector.  Efforts to resolve the gap at the European and international level raise matters with profound economic implications for Ireland, particularly our agriculture and food sector.  Every sector must of course play its part in the national transition agenda; there can be and are no exceptions.  The main issue is that policy on agricultural land use at EU level and in the international process under the UN convention is incomplete.  We must bear in mind that gap and how it might ultimately be resolved in our deliberations on climate policy and legislation.  Irish engagement in the ongoing efforts to resolve the gap is focused on seeking to optimise the opportunity for the highest ambition possible on the part of the agricultural sector as a whole, that is, livestock and land.  I will outline presently the highly ambitious agenda which the Government, in anticipation of the planned primary legislation, has set for four sectors of the economy, including agriculture.<\/p><p>  The third key point is greenhouse gas emission targets.  Domestic targets at whatever level or timeframe, be it 30% for 2020, 40% by 2030 or 80% for 2050, are not just numbers.  It is very attractive to talk about ambitious headline numbers such as 80% by 2050 but entirely shallow and indefensible if they have no substance.  In other words, there is little point in putting forward such objectives if there is no clear case for an additional layer of targets or if proposed targets are not presented and considered in the context of Ireland's specific greenhouse gas emissions profile and on the basis of where and how they are expected to be achieved.  As I said in my letter of January 2012 to the Chairman's predecessor, while targets, trajectories and institutional arrangements are of huge importance as part of a robust national position, they are elements of structure and process which do not directly address the core political issue of where and how greenhouse gas emission reductions are to be achieved across the economy and society.<\/p><p>  The need to re-frame our national agenda from \"how much\" to \"how to\" is strongly borne out by the comprehensive climate policy analysis reports from the NESC secretariat.  When I spoke in the House in February in response to a Bill brought forward by Deputy Catherine Murphy, I made the point that Ireland already has a challenging greenhouse gas reduction target for 2020 which is binding under EU law.  I also told the House that the legislation the Government proposes to bring forward will be unequivocal in terms of compliance with existing and future obligations of the State under EU law and any other international agreement to which the State becomes a party.  The unequivocal commitment on compliance relates both to existing and future obligations of the State.  For Ireland, future obligations under EU and international law are not some remote possibility.  They are a reality and we are fully committed to meeting them.<\/p><p>  In publishing the recent Green Paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policy, the European Commission has already initiated a debate on a 2030 EU target.  The Green Paper is a political priority for the EU in progressing decarbonisation across the European economy and further developing EU leadership in preparation for negotiations on a new international climate treaty which we hope will be finalised in Paris in 2015.  We already have a challenging and binding 2020 reduction target under EU law.  In the relatively near future we expect to have a further challenging target for 2030.  We are fully committed to meeting these and all subsequent targets.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that targets are not the only barometer of ambition or commitment.  In anticipation of the planned legislation, the Government has already announced a high level of mitigation ambition for 2050.  Work is under way on low-carbon roadmaps in four key sectors of the economy, namely, energy, buildings, transport and agriculture.  The ambition is to achieve near zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 in the case of energy, buildings and transport, and carbon neutrality in the case of agriculture.  This sectoral element of the road-mapping process will underpin work on a 2050 national low-carbon roadmap which will be completed by my Department following public consultation next year.  This approach has substance in that it addresses Ireland's specific greenhouse gas emissions profile and sets out a way forward that is realistic and relevant to the negotiations on the policy gap to which I referred.  The steps already taken by the Government in anticipation of the primary legislation demonstrate the depth of consideration underpinning our approach and the proposed provisions of the climate action and low carbon development Bill.  The underlying policy may not be immediately evident from the text of the outline heads.<\/p><p>  The fourth point is that Ireland is not a laggard on climate protection.  In fact, it is quite the contrary.  As well as meeting our greenhouse gas reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol in the 2008 to 2012 commitment period, due in part the impact of economic recession, we also put in train the intensive analytical and policy work necessary to underpin much higher ambition in the future.  We certainly face a challenging target for 2020 under EU law, but one of the priorities in initiating the policy development process in which we are now engaged was to identify and adopt the additional measures necessary to achieve our 2020 compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000003#B00400","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will take members' questions in groups of three.

I can only speak on my own behalf but the recent sessions at which we have discussed the heads of the Bill with many of the stakeholders have been invigorating and interesting.  Points of divergence and tension have emerged and we hope these will be reflected in our final report.  I hope that report, when it is published, will be of assistance to the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister was very clear in the context of what he said with regard to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  I do not wish to put words in his mouth but he appears to be suggesting that we have not arrived at a clear set of measurements which we can use to quantify Ireland's exact level of such emissions.  He also seemed to suggest that putting in place targets or objectives in this regard would be premature and that there is more work to be done in the context of developing a national and specific greenhouse gas emissions measurement mechanism.  The Minister was also very clear with regard to how reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should be achieved.  He is consistent in this regard in that he is not necessarily in favour of national targets or objectives being included in the body of the legislation.  Two questions arise from what the Minister said.  Is he of the view that burden-sharing would offer us an outlet in respect of this matter?  He suggested that the agricultural sector should be carbon neutral and that the other three sectors should try to achieve certain reductions.  Is he suggesting, therefore, that burden-sharing would provide us with a way to reduce overall emission levels?  The Minister does not agree with including targets or objectives in primary legislation.  A former Scottish Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, Mr. Stewart Stevenson, addressed this committee and indicated that Scotland put in place annual targets which were separate from the legislation.  These targets were not designed as a way for politicians to be admonished if they were not achieved and, as a result, they became self-fulfilling in nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000004#C00300","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Ms Lyons and Ms Tallon.  The main issues which I believe arise relate to the need for overall targets in the context of 2050 and the need for five-year carbon budgets.  Some of those who previously made presentations to the committee have actually argued for three-year targets.  I would not argue for the latter in the context of trying to be restrictive but rather from the point of view of taking small steps forward.  If there are only eight steps on a staircase which should contain 13, then one will be obliged to take very long strides as one ascends.  It would be much better if we took small incremental steps.  We must also ensure that successive Governments will fulfil their obligations.<\/p><p>  Another matter which arises is the advisory body, the make-up thereof and the need for it to be completely independent.  Said body must also be in a position to publish its reports.  As it is currently drafted, head 10 would appear to allow for a break in this regard in that a Minister may decide not to follow the advice or recommendations of the advisory body.  What is the position with regard to the Taoiseach's office having overall responsibility in this area?<\/p><p>  I have raised the issue of mitigation with the Minister on previous occasions.  I accept that work, which is being done in conjunction with Teagasc, is ongoing in the context of assessing the position with regard to mitigation and the sequestration effects of bogs, forests and grasslands.  One of the matters which continually arises relates to what we can count in this regard.  I do not want the position to be overstated or understated.  Regardless of the system we choose, it must be accurate because it will need to be credible.  Apparently the mitigation offered via the sequestration of bogs and forests cannot be offset against agriculture.  As a result, there is a need for a decision to be made on this matter.  Will the Minister comment on this matter?  It is extremely important - in the Irish context - that the sequestration effects of bogs, forests, grasslands and hedgerows should be able to be brought into the equation in the context of offsetting overall emissions.  What is the position in respect of this matter and who will be responsible for making the decision on how we should proceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000004#C00400","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before us.  The key issue at the heart of this debate relates to whether we should set targets.  I am of the view that we cannot set targets unless there is a proper alignment of policies throughout our entire national framework.  We are informed that agriculture, transport and industry are among the main contributors of carbon emissions.  We have put in place ambitious targets under Food Harvest 2020 in respect of food production and exports in order to assist the country's economic recovery.  I read an observation on a blog in recent days which indicated that at these hearings only one group - the IFA - has objected to the setting of targets.  I was present at the hearings which took place on Friday last and many people from industry, business and other sectors stated that by setting targets we could seriously undermine the national recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000004#C00500","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373478000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail asked some general questions on our approach to climate change policy.  The best example I can give the Senator is that during our Presidency we did an enormous amount of work in completing files in the European Parliament process which were lying around for a considerable period and which we prioritised.  We got conclusions on priority substances - water, CO2 emissions on cars and vans, F gases and the emissions trading schemes.  All of those files have resulted in a progressive approach towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in their own way through the legislative process in the European Parliament without any targets.  A whole-of-government approach was taken in terms of what the Government was trying to achieve.  We have issues of sustainability and a framework to promote that at international level as well through the sustainable development goals and the millennium development goals, on which a huge amount of progress was made.  Council conclusions were reached on those during the course of our Presidency.<\/p><p>  I prioritised our future level of ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions at our informal Council meeting in April.  It might come as a surprise to some people, particularly those in the non-governmental organisation community, that I would prioritise where we go between 2020 and 2030 to develop even greater levels of ambition than those we had between now and 2020 to keep up the momentum in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  I have prioritised in a practical way some of the issues that will be centre stage in the European process in the coming years.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Stanley is aware, we do not have legally binding targets in Ireland.

I am aware of a mantra going about that we should sign up to a 2050 target before anyone else, that we should demonstrate that level of ambition.  We are a competitive, open economy and we will work in conjunction with our European Union partners.  The European Union states are the leaders in trying to do something about this issue in the world in terms of ambition, and Ireland is among the progressive states that are forging alliances with people from outside the EU to drive that particular agenda of meeting all of the various policy changes at local level to meet the 2015 UN convention outcome, which we all hope we will able to complete by that time, in Paris.  That is ambitious enough but from Ireland's point of view, we will be participating fully, and we have done so in the past six to 12 months, as part of the EU Council deliberations in driving that  agenda in Doha and in Poland at the end of this year when it is hoped we will make further progress in meeting the EU legally binding targets to which we signed up.  Otherwise, we will be in the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p>  When I became Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government I inherited 31 files where Ireland had been brought to the European Court of Justice and where we were running the risk, as we were on the wastewater treatment systems and the groundwater quality, of fines on a daily basis.  I tackled that issue.  I am very conscious that we could be facing fines again if we do not hit our 2020 targets.  We will do everything we can in that regard, but I have a different approach.  I have an approach where all of the stakeholders are involved, by agreement, rather than imposing a solution which somebody would like me to do.  For that reason we have the roadmap process and with the help of the NESC secretariat and the Departments of energy, agriculture, transport and buildings, we will be able to get agreement from those Ministers on the milestones we need to reach and the progress we must make in all those areas because this is a whole-of-government approach.  This is not my approach or the Deputy's approach.  This is what is required in each of the Departments to help us achieve our 2020 targets, which are onerous but on which I am prepared to seek the support of the Government, with the chairmanship of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet committee process, to deliver.  We will have objectives in those sectoral roadmaps for each of the Departments that are causing the major difficulties for us in meeting those EU legally binding targets by 2020.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Coffey that we need to have a whole-of-government approach.  Pragmatic suggestions must be taken on board by all communities, local and national authorities and agencies as well as business to ensure we do things differently from the way we did them in the past.  We no longer have an option in the way we do our business, in agriculture or as a society, of taking an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>  approach to this issue.  We must do this on the basis of achieving the objectives we set out in a practical way.  Any encouragement I can give, I will do so.<\/p><p>  Deputy Stanley mentioned carbon sinks.  We have an issue with the area of land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, in the European Union.  We took our eye off the ball in regard to the way forestry, peat and grassland is calculated for the purposes of Ireland's effort sharing in relation to our EU obligations.  We took our eye off the ball in 2008 and 2009 when that was being negotiated but we have peatlands in the context of being used as a carbon store and sink, including any institutional arrangements, for moving on this issue.  That has been the subject of a bogland study where the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in co-operation with the Peatlands Council, is preparing a draft peatlands strategy.  I hope that will be completed by the end of the year.  Obviously, it will have some impact, depending on the negotiations, in terms of the way, under the LULUCF, peat, forestry and grassland generally will be calculated in the post-2020 emissions proposals that will come forward from the European Commission by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000005#D00600","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1373478000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Regarding what the Minister said, Teagasc is doing a study of grasslands-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000005#D00700","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1373478000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>No.  It is feeding into the process in agriculture from the point of view of the sectoral roadmaps.

Please feel free to stop me if I am being repetitive but the process has been quite informative.  The concept of having hearings on the heads of the Bill has been highly informative in respect of this joint committee's thinking and, it is to be hoped, when the Minister proceeds to flesh out the heads of the Bill into legislation.  A consensus that emerged among all groups was that the Fiscal Advisory Council could be a good template for an expert advisory body and I ask the Minister to consider this possibility.  There certainly was a lot of what I would call negative reaction when the heads of the Bill were first published.  However, much of that may have arisen from misunderstandings, in particular with regard to head 3, in which targets actually are set under international agreements although the 2020 target is already enshrined in legislation.  It also provides for any such targets negotiated in the proposed 2015 agreement.  It would be interesting were the Minister to revert to the joint committee at a later stage on the negotiations for 2015 and the process by which we can improve the position in respect of peatlands, grasslands and forestry, which probably was not covered.<\/p><p>  Arising from the hearings themselves, I have come to the viewpoint that the best mechanism probably involves setting the national roadmap first, rather than drawing up sectoral roadmaps first and then setting the national roadmap subsequently.  This might be a better process although I do not know whether the Minister has yet given thought to it.  As for the seven-year review period, everyone, right across the board, considers it probably to be too long and has sought a reduction to a period of five years.  One item to emerge through the hearings concerns black carbon, which does not appear to be covered under any of the existing heads.  If the report of this joint committee recommends the inclusion of black carbon, does the Minister have thoughts on where it might be included under the heads of the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000006#E00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1373478600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and appreciate that the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht will have an input into shaping the Bill.  I believe it to be a new way of engaging in the business of government and note that participative democracy is at work in this regard.  It is to be hoped that some recommendations will be brought forward.  While I believe everyone shares the same objective, the question is how to get to it.  In addition, all members share the objectives of ensuring that whatever is done is sustainable and that the country will be able to bear it economically because, as I have stated previously, there is no point in having airy-fairy ideas while being unable to implement them.  I am a realist and have listened carefully to the advice coming from all sectors, including scientists, meteorologists, community groups and others who have made studies of this issue, as well as very good input from the Department.  While this has been a learning experience, a point I took from the Minister's comments, which also had been made to members in another submission, possibly that of Professor Bates, is that the European Union's accounting procedures definitely required examination.  Obviously, this issue must be considered in more detail because 30% of Ireland's emissions output comes from agriculture on which much of our economy is based, whereas the European Union average is 10% overall.  In other words, Ireland is starting from a different base and, therefore, the accounting methodology must be revisited.  The joint committee also heard a presentation on how the measurements were conducted and the area that was taken into consideration.  As the position is very different when one compares Ireland with much larger countries, this is another issue that must be considered in greater detail.<\/p><p>  As Deputies Humphreys and Coffey have noted, the targets comprise the main topic of the day.  One submission, I think from Friends of the Earth, suggested they should be called national objectives and not targets as, therefore, they would be primary objectives and a roadmap could be laid out.  The Minister himself and other submissions have referred to the question of \"how much\".  However, we must concentrate on the question of \"how to\" to get to the question of \"how much\" and were we to lay down \"how much\" without knowing \"how to\", we will not get there.  Consequently, we must know how to get there.  As for the stakeholders, particularly in respect of transport, heat and so on, that sector's objective must be raised, even though wind energy has risen from 1% up to 16% at present.  However, in the absence of all the Departments coming together, it is difficult to try to get renewable energy of the ground if one faces objections all the time.  Obviously one also must educate people to bring them with one but in addition, consideration must be given to the co-ordination between Departments.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government must drive matters to ensure the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources considers financing and whether it must be changed to include wind energy at sea and facilities for that.  I know it is increasingly expensive but the output is greater, the return is much greater and it would be faster.  Consequently, a coming together of the stakeholders would be desirable.  Deputy Humphreys also mentioned a point I had intended to make regarding the possibility of revising the seven-year review period to five years and while the Minister probably will not comment on that suggestion today, I will make a point to flag my perspective.<\/p><p>  What I have most in mind is to learn more about the accounting procedure.  Three or four people around the table have stated that farming is important to us, that it must be considered and that we must ensure we are starting with a level playing field.  In addition, one of the climatologists who appeared mentioned that because of climate change and the warming of the Mediterranean countries, the food output there will not be great, as the facilities around the Mediterranean will not be as good as they are at present.  Consequently, from the perspective of food security, it will fall to the Nordic countries and ourselves to look at food production and this must be taken into consideration.  The Minister has just concluded his role in the Presidency of the European Union, in which Ireland did a great job.  While Ireland has been noted as a good, clean, green country, we must ensure we keep it that way and that is what is going forward.  Moreover, we should build on where we are and as the Minister himself has stated, we no longer have an option but must go forward with the climate change Bill.  Hopefully we ultimately will come up with some good recommendations and I thank the Minister for his input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071000006#E00500","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1373478600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.

It was hoped that there would have been further progress to date.  As part of our Council conclusions in June, we agreed an EU-member state adaptation policy on climate change.  I hope this will trigger additional resources through various EU programmes for member states.

Very important to Ireland is the balance between our ability to produce quality food and the opportunities presented by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with the abolition of quotas, bearing in mind that we export 90% of what we produce agriculturally.  It is very important that we strike the right balance between environmental protection and food production.  Will the reformed Common Agricultural Policy present Ireland with difficulties in the lead-up to 2020 in that many farmers will be considering increasing their herds, particularly their dairy herds?  I recently met a farmer who was increasing his herd from 80 to 150.  Unless there is balance in the legislation, there will be a negative impact on our capacity to produce quality food.

They are voting with their feet in regard to how they will respond to the growing need for additional food and the manner in which the manufacturing and production processes will work towards reaching targets, such as the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  The share of the Common Agricultural Policy has now enshrined for the first time an increased amount of consideration for environmental objectives.  I would have believed a little more would have been appreciated but what I describe indicates the new consciousness of the new cross-departmental role in the areas of agriculture and environmental protection.

I guess that would include many service providers like Rehab, COPE and the Brothers of Charity.  Nonetheless, it is a very impressive figure.  From looking at the forum's report, one can see that the annual philanthropy figure is about &euro;500 million, which is not something I would have been fully appreciated.  Not only do we have a patent cliff, we are facing a philanthropy cliff, which presents a very significant challenge to the country.

With regard to research, much discussion about the scheme has taken place with finance houses such as PwC and KPMG, legal houses, the Institute of Taxation and others used to this world.  We have made a proposal and it will have to be worked by those who put the final design on it on if it is to be implemented.  It is done in a very simple way because simple schemes work best.  People would get additional time in Ireland by paying money.  The tax is additional to all existing taxes and would be a new superlevy which is not instead of anything.  I do not know what it will look like when the drafters are finished.<\/p><p>  I hope everybody will join in; I do not know whether the scale is too high but the potential is there.  Most countries, including United States, Britain and Portugal, have implemented this measure in precisely this way.  Several countries are trying to attract capital back to their countries and are doing so in different ways.  Some are providing fiscal incentives to those bringing money to their countries, such as lower than usual tax rates.  This is what Britain is doing to attract capital investment.  Our residency requirements, as I understand it, are very restrictive and this proposal, if people sign up, would normalise it.  Every country uses this type of measure in one way or another to try to regulate its affairs with the part of its capital structure conducting its business outside the country for business reasons.<\/p><p>  I believe we will get a minimum of one in ten which would be very significant.

One would be absolutely certain it would be distributed throughout the economy in the most effective possible way.  There is a very strong emphasis on the social economy and social entrepreneurship.  We will try to assist organisations.  It would be a source of capital and development capital for the not for profit sector, which is being starved of resources in every size, shape and form at present.  This is another aspect of it.  The Government might very well state if people are contributing money that other types of operations would be equally valid.  Who is to say relief of poverty or organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are at least as necessary as some of the issues we are discussing?

None the less, we view it as an opportunity to bring in additional funds to do necessary work.<\/p><p>  There is also the possibility that those in question would then have a better relationship with the Irish people.  Might the public at home not view them better if they did more for Ireland?  Even if their residency status does not trigger it, they might simply desire to participate further in what Ireland is trying to do officially.  That aspect is more philanthropic, but I would not rule it out.  It has been proven worldwide that people with resources surplus to their requirements cannot take it all with them.  There is no pocket in the shroud.  The idea of dispensing one's extra funds while alive is gaining currency.  We should give people opportunities to do so.  We should certainly offer them the challenge.  If they do not accept it, they do not accept it, but that would confirm what people say about them.<\/p><p>  There are more reasons to do this, for example, one wants to help one's country more.

I can speak from two angles.  I am a co-founder of the One Foundation and, until approximately one week ago, ran it for the past ten years.  Setting up a foundation or fund equivalent to the social innovation fund takes no time at all, but raising capital takes time.  One can do nothing until one has the capital to reinvest or re-grant, depending on one's point of view.  Hence, the urgency.<\/p><p>  I will cite a few examples from my experience in the One Foundation.  We were involved in providing growth capital to the not-for-profit sector.  It largely went to social services, for example, children's services, youth services, some human rights services, migrant services and education.  For the past seven years or so, we have been involved in providing growth capital to Educate Together.  We did not provide it all in one chunk.  We took three decisions at different points and Educate Together needed to re-satisfy the criteria each time.  In that period, Educate Together has entered the second level sector and will open three new schools in 2014 with all of the jobs and local investment that entails, for example, building the schools and satisfying parental needs in the areas in question.  During that eight-year period, Educate Together also added 12,000 new primary school pupils and approximately 30 new primary schools to its network.

Finance is provided by a combination of the Government, the HSE in the northwest, the health board in the North of Ireland, Unilever, some private philanthropists and the EU.  A mixture of finance is used.  The scheme now operates in 160 schools across the island of Ireland.  The model is key to the restorative process in the North and is an example of one solution.

This Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising document is an excellent one.  It has busted a few myths for me and I am quite sad about some of the myths it has busted.  We always had this impression that Ireland was the most giving nation in the world but the witnesses have outlined some very hard facts in regard to comparisons between ourselves and our closet neighbours.  Some 15% of Irish donors give in a planned fashion compared to 36% of donors next door while the Irish figure in terms of percentage of disposable income is 0.8%, compared to 1.2%.  The witnesses' analysis of high earners is stark.  The top 400 earners in the country make up of 10% of charitable giving compared to 30% in the UK, Germany and the US.  Corporations are worse.  Only 1.4%, or &euro;25 million, came from corporate donations in 2005, which is less than 0.1%, whereas in Britain, it was an average of 1.2% of their pre-tax profits.  That is the standard.<\/p><p>  I commend the witnesses on the views and proposals they have put forward, which merit further discussion.  I will not have the time but I would like to go into a number of the taxation proposals in regard to charitable bodies and the hybrid rate of 33%.  I will probably not get the chance but if I do, I will come back in later.  I would like to talk about why the witnesses are here.<\/p><p>  Any proposal that increases investment in philanthropy should be discussed and teased out.  I have serious initial concerns about this proposal, which stems from the point of view that it is a fundamental change to the tax residency laws.  We call these people tax exiles.  They are Irish residents but they do not stay here for more than 182 per year and, therefore, they do not have to pay taxes on their global profits but only on their Irish interests profits.  We know many of them and it has been reported in the media that they go to the limit.  They will be here for 182 days per year, or 280 days over two years.<\/p><p>  We saw an abuse of this system up to 2008.  One of the proposals suggests increasing the number of days they can spend here in two consecutive years but the witnesses want to row back on the change made in 2009 when we got rid of the Cinderella clause where we had the jets taking off from Dublin Airport at 11.59 p.m. so that the day was not counted.  I have serious concerns because it could lend to the view that we are selling tax residency.  However, that is not to ditch the whole proposal and the concept.<\/p><p>  The witnesses said there is a demand.  The previous Government took in the domicile levy which would have had a lower threshold in terms of what people would have to contribute.  The witnesses suggest a &euro;5 million levy with no return for them on that &euro;5 million.  The domicile levy is &euro;200,000, which can be written off against taxes on Irish interests.  Only seven people paid the domicile levy in the last year for which we have figures.  There are 11,307 people who made an income tax return in 2011 who have claimed they are non-tax resident.  The pool of people to whom this could apply would be 11,307.  We see with the domicile levy that it is very low.<\/p><p>  The immigrant investor programme, on which the witnesses say this is modelled, is welcome in terms of bringing in new money but only nine people have signed up for it.  I am not sure this will be the panacea and that is why I am concerned about it.  If we only get four to seven people, there is an argument that it is money we never had, so let us grab it with both hands and invest it into social enterprises and philanthropy and try to keep the wheels moving as these to big projects start to wind down.  However, there is another argument which is that some of these tax exiles have considerable interests in this State and some of them are very high profile and that to grant them additional days in this State is to facilitate their tax exile status.  If they were to stay those extra days in the State, they would actually be taxed on their global profits, so they State would lose on out a lot of money.<\/p><p>  I am not fully sure about taking the two steps the witnesses want, including increasing the number of days.  The Cinderella clause takes it further because it will be an additional number of days because the day they fly off will not be counted.  Currently, if they spend a minute in the State on a particular day, they are tax resident for that day.  I am concerned about that.<\/p><p>  The Department of Finance has done a review on tax exile status and the programme for Government commits that they will pay more.  Did the witnesses look at the 183 days and going in reverse?  For example, 163 days would apply but it would be 183 days if one made the &euro;5 million levy and the &euro;1 million contribution.   <\/p><p>  The witnesses acknowledged other issues which we would need to tease out in terms of where the investment would be in regard to the SMEs.  The concept is good but it could be abused by a small number of people who would make huge gains as a result.  Those are my views on that.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the other proposals in the document, including the proposal on the simplification of the Tax (Consolidation) Act and tax relief going to individuals.  Will the witnesses talk through the proposals they have put forward?  Proposal one is that it would all go to the charity.  Proposals two and three are that the donor would keep it and so on.  Why are those arguments being made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000009#H00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373464500,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty has hit several nails on the head.

If people in question are being asked to pony up an additional &euro;15 million over ten years, of which &euro;6 million will come in the first year, human nature being what it is, there has to be some incentive for them to do this.

We think we can get some significant money out of this population, or at least we should be able to challenge them for it in a very direct way, as I said.<\/p><p>  The Deputy employs the concept of the carrot and the stick; in other words, if an offer is made to the group and people do not take it up, there could be a negative impact, whereas if they take up the offer, there will be a positive impact.

There would be a positive aspect to the scheme to encourage people to move in this direction.  I do not know what the practicalities would be, but the Revenue Commissioners would know the practical consequences.  That principle could easily be applied and it bears out the Deputy's argument that there is a fair degree of thought, work and talk to be undertaken about the scheme to make it practical and workable.  From our perspective, that practical and workable form should be something we could propose to be able to tell people it would be in their interests to sign up to it.

I am speaking from my experience in my position in One Foundation in the past ten years.  On the question of why we would bring forward such a proposal, it is because the existing philanthropic cliff looks like being &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million a year, but it will be going within two years.  We need to find money fast or there will be a car crash.  It is a case of where one finds money that does not take it away from somewhere else in the economy.  There are not very many places in which to look.  In my experience over ten years, when we set up One Foundation, which was founded with tax-resident money, we really believed philanthropy was a relay race and that we would play our part for ten years, spend our capital and then other philanthropists would come in.  That was the Celtic tiger and we were not expecting a recession.  However, even during the Celtic tiger period, that did not happen and new philanthropies were not set up on any scale; in fact, there was hardly any.  We learned that this took longer and we are not yet there in terms of potential Irish philanthropists, tax-resident or otherwise, actually going ahead and making these donations and of the scale we urgently need in the next two years.  This would not always be our preferred scheme, but we are in a situation where we really need to find new money and we need to find it in ways that will not dislodge existing tax income or spending in the economy.  We are undertaking a national giving campaign, but there is one group we are not targeting.  There is an equity argument which questions why would some of our wealthiest citizens do not play their part in the national recovery and asks how can we encourage them to step forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Mortell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373465100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty has raised very salient points.

In our view, this is punitive for that community who are the tax exiles.  This is a significant investment - I do not care how much money a person has - it is a lot of money.  I do not think Ireland could be perceived as being soft on the persons who are not paying taxes and who live outside for that reason.

As Mr. Flannery said, we can put flesh on the bones of this idea.  If I thought there were hundreds of people availing of this scheme and some of them might attempt to abuse it, it could be justified by the number of genuine people who have Irish residency status in America or Canada or wherever else who want to contribute to this scheme, but the reality is that we all know there are people here who moved their interests overseas in order to reduce their tax liability.  The State has been trying to restrict this behaviour.  We have got rid of the Cinderella clause.  The Commission on Taxation has recommended that we tighten further, for example, that the abode and centre of interests not be recognised on the basis of a number of days.  Some of these individuals may buy tax residency because their accountants will advise them that &euro;1 million per year for the next ten years will buy tax residency, with the clause that &euro;5 million must be invested which may or may not provide a return.  It is a cost of &euro;1 million for tax residency for an extra 42 days per year.  That is a significant bonus for people who deliberately moved their interests overseas in order to reduce their tax liability but still have interests here.  It is a very cheap price.  I am concerned about that aspect.  While there would be a gain in terms of philanthropy, overall, there would be a loss to the State because if we were to change the tax residency rules to make them more restrictive, the State would benefit far more.

I am very nervous with regard to an issue that could run again against the tightening up policy we propose.  It has been said we could be talking about from 40 to 50 individuals.  I know of one or two of these and have seen them come in to the media events around their donation and then fly out the next day.  These people choose where they pay their taxes.  They would originally have made their money in Ireland, but have not chosen to be tax exiles.  Ms Glucksman said this was painful for them, but to be honest I think it is not painful enough.  They should pay their taxes in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The real concern is the 182 days and since the Government took office, it has tried to ensure this time is accountable and that these tax exiles cannot fly in an out as they please, as they had been doing.  I hope this is very painful for them and wish it was a lot more painful, particularly for some individuals.  Although I would like to mention them, I will not, but one or two of them live in the constituency I represent.  This is my main concern in this regard.  The 40 or 50 individuals, a couple of whom I could name, became tax exiles because they did not want to pay taxes in this State.  They like doing media events and contributing to some of the high profile events we have here.  Citizens would be annoyed if we started giving them additional days for &euro;36,585 a day.  That is not a lot of money for some of these individuals, but &euro;585 is a lot for somebody on a low income.  Why should people be able to buy domicile?<\/p><p>  I understand why this proposal is being made, because I have worked with many organisations that have access to those funds, but even those organisations and individuals would have questions about this.  Deputy McGrath asked what research had been done on this proposal and Mr. Flannery said he had spoken to a few financial houses.  Last week, I discussed this with a few people who work in these financial houses and they had a broad grin on their faces.  I understood from this that our financial houses here are fairly good at running a horse and four through our tax laws.  That is where I come from on this.  I fully respect the work that has been done on this proposal, but it would turn my stomach if some of these individuals were allowed have additional days in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The same is probably true for many people here.  They have seen these tax exiles make their money and leave the country but retain expensive show houses in Dublin and return to Ireland for their 182 days.  If these people could buy additional residency, citizens would probably go along with Deputy Doherty's proposal to reduce the number of days they can spend in Ireland.  I might go along with the proposal that if we reduced the number of days to 100 and offered an additional 30 days for a &euro;5 million investment and &euro;36,000 a day, we could look at that sympathetically.

However, that was a different Ireland and society.  Most of what was done in Ireland, in great public buildings, services, hospitals, etc., was done through philanthropy.  Those were different times, but philanthropy was very strong.  In a way, that same culture is still very strong in Britain.<\/p><p>  What happened in Ireland was that this economic model was destroyed through the land Acts at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, when there was a huge transfer of wealth, followed by an economic war and a period of extreme protectionism.  This was followed by the free trade Act in the 1960s and then the European Economic Community in the 1970s, which blew away what remained of that old wealth, industry and thinking to a large extent.  Some of the trusts still in existence here are old endowments from 100 or 200 years ago and they now only provide a small amount of money.<\/p><p>  The wealth we have now in Ireland is a creation of the Ireland of the late 1950s, 1960s and since.  This was driven by the State incentivising behaviour it wanted to encourage.  It started off by making profit on exports tax free, back in the late 1950s.  The first programme of economic expansion was built on such ideas.  Then we incentivised inward investment through setting up a low corporate tax rate.  We developed outfits like the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, C&oacute;ras Tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la and so on, giving grants and assistance of all kinds to help people.  More recently, when we did not have enough hotels, we created schemes for their development, until we had too many.  We also created incentives for house building.  Every activity in the economy we wanted to push, we incentivised it in a similar way.  This is how we developed our economy.<\/p><p>  The wealth we have now is relatively new wealth that came through in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  Basically, the whole thinking in the past 50 or 60 years in Ireland has been to do with making money, but there is no generational feeling with regard to what to do with it.  There certainly was no such feeling during the Celtic tiger era, when there was a mad dash to create more money.  Anyone would say that what went on in the development explosion was that all of the profits from the previous deal were pumped into the next deal.

There are tax exiles who made their money in Ireland and this gives them an additional day here for what would be a very modest sum of money out of their incomes.  They are back in Ireland making more money on their investments.  There is a lot wrong with our tax code and there was greed throughout the boom.  A lot of the people who made money then were extremely greedy and this is probably why we did not see that giving.  I would like to encourage giving.  The 1% proposal is good and corporate Ireland should be encouraged to give that.  The element of Mr. Flannery&rsquo;s proposal with which I take issue is that of the 40 or 50 individuals he mentioned there are greedy people who are tax exiles, having made their money in Ireland and this would give them a get-out-of-jail card, even if only for one or two days, for what to them is probably a modest sum of money.

I was working in the McKinsey Dublin office when this work was done and I have been using those data.  Sadly, we are less charitable than we believe.  We have our moments.  For example, the Irish gave more to the Darfur crisis<i> per capita<\/i> than any other nation on Earth.  This is something of which to be proud.  As a percentage of our net income, however, we do not do well.  Our corporates are a disgrace.  I have worked in philanthropy in the UK and the US.  As per the 2009 McKinsey report, our corporates give &euro;1 for every &euro;12 that corporates in the UK give.  The private sector in Ireland should be ashamed of itself.  I hope that the various ideas presented at this meeting on a national giving campaign will make this obvious.  Our corporates benefit from a variety of measures.  For example, they enjoy one third less taxation than the rate in the UK.  Even benefitting from that, they still only give one 12th what corporations in the UK give.<\/p><p>  Sadly, our rich people are some of the meanest rich people in the world.  The McKinsey analysis is a wonderful bar chart that shows the number of philanthropies established as a percentage of high net worth individuals of the population.  An interesting graph that is not included in this documentation shows some European countries.  At the bottom on its own, almost in need of its own scale, is Ireland.  Mr. Declan Ryan was generous in funding the One Foundation.  Mr. Chuck Feeney was also generous, as were a few others.  Our rich people are in their own category of mean.  It is not that they are 10% worse than the average.  They redefine a new level of mean.  A bunch of them do not even stay in the country to pay their taxes.<\/p><p>  It would be great if this information got out and we started calling it as it was.  We believe that we are a wonderful, gregarious and charitable nation.  We are not.  We have our moments, but we give less, our corporates give much less after paying much less tax and our rich people are the meanest rich people in Europe.  I will not do well for political funding for the next election, but we must call it as it is.<\/p><p>  This proposal is a practical solution.  I am happy that the various members of the forum have suggested that it does not sit well with them, as it does not sit well with me either.  I would prefer it if the people in question lived in Ireland and paid their taxes like everyone else.  However, it is what it is.<\/p><p>  I will ask a few specific questions.  How would the distribution of the funds be prioritised?  Let us take scenario C of the proposal.  If 40 people participated, we could have investment of $200 million - I presume that is US dollars - in business and charities and extra revenue of $400 million to the Exchequer.  That is a huge amount of money.<\/p><p>  The proposal is called a job and social cohesion initiative, which sounds good.  Selling it would be good politically, as everyone likes jobs, but my understanding is that it would take over from philanthropic money.  Straightforward, good, valuable, local job creation is not what the One Foundation, the Ireland Funds or other bodies fund currently.  They fund philanthropy and community-based measures.  For example, they target disadvantaged youth, recidivism and so forth.  As we know from Mr. O'Hara of Ashoka and Ms Casey, they also target social entrepreneurship.  Would this initiative replace the philanthropic funding or would some of that funding drift towards straightforward and valuable, but non-philanthropic, non-social cohesion, job creation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000013#M00600","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373466900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  If this money emerges, precisely how it will be distributed has not been defined.  We provided some strong recommendations, for example, investment in the social innovation fund of Ireland and the job generation scheme.  They are different types of scheme, as the former would assist projects in the social economy.  As Ms Mortell explained, these projects would be scalable and be capable of being successful and sustainable.  In other words, they would not need continual help.  They would have the capacity to stand on their own feet.  Regardless of whether they would provide services to the community, the Government or whoever, they would need to be sustainable models.  It is a real economy.  The number of employees in the not-for-profit sector is 102,000.  A real injection of energy could double that number.<\/p><p>  The discussion on how this would be done is yet to be held.  The Government or the scheme could identify certain categories of investment that were acceptable within the scheme, for example, the social innovation and job generation funds.  It would depend on the emphasis placed by the Government or the Legislature on certain uses for the money.  That is up for discussion to a certain extent, provided that the money is invested generally in the development of the social economy, services and jobs.<\/p><p>  Why jobs?  At the heart of Government policy is the issue of jobs.  It will remain a high priority for a number of years.  Investment in the not-for-profit sector is capable of a more efficient transfer of investment into employment than any other sector, albeit with the possible exception of opening new hotels or the like.  The services sector can be good at generating jobs.  There is little leakage of investment in the not-for-profit sector.<\/p><p>  This proposal is not an attempt to replace philanthropy, but to increase the amount of money available by attracting new, non-displacing money.  We do not want to set up a largely philanthropic-based social innovation fund that would compete with existing operators who are already struggling.<\/p> <p>The market at the moment is too small for that.  Our proposal is part of an effort to create a larger market which would generate more resources.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to the finding in the most recent McKinsey report that our corporates give &euro;1 for every &euro;12 given by their counterparts in the United Kingdom.  The headline figure is that 0.1% of corporate profits in this country are dedicated to philanthropy compared with a figure of 1.2% in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  I do not know any reason for the discrepancy other than that Irish corporates are not switched on to giving, do not think about it and have no reason to do it.  It is not a discussion they have with their auditors, tax advisers or anybody.  One of the triggers internationally in encouraging giving, whether by corporates or individuals, is where a discussion takes place at the end of the year when people are doing their final returns.  If one's philanthropic effort has some effect on one's final return, it becomes a matter of discussion.  It has been shown that where that discussion does take place, the amount of giving increases fourfold on average compared with what is given in the absence of discussion.  The problem is that this type of discussion would never take place in a company in Ireland because there is hardly any reason for it.  In the case of expenditure on research and development, for example, there is a tangible incentive.  There is no incentive at all to give philanthropically; it simply does not arise.<\/p><p> I do not know whether one can conclude that rich people are inherently mean.  It is more likely that they are simply not switched on to giving and do not even think about it.  Perhaps they have an idea that they will do something in their will.  Our objective is to get the concept of giving while living into our system.  Problems need to be solved now, not in 50 years' time.  We would very much welcome a debate with the public wheel as represented by the Parliament and the political system in general and dragging in the Civil Service as well.  We must, in the first instance, ascertain the capacity of the sector to deliver.  We must consider how we can put some investment in, whether a body modelled on IDA Ireland, for example, might be appropriate.  The bottom line is that there has never been a real attempt to develop the sector.  It was always looked at as being relatively insignificant.  Members today have expressed surprise at the scale of the sector and the reality that 102,000 people are employed in it.  We are used to encountering people's surprise, but the reality is that there is scope to make the sector much larger.  It is a sector offering tough employment.  It is indigenously structured and will be there when other stuff is gone.  It will never be off in some fancy lagoon, because it is not that type of thing at all.  There is much to be gained in offering it real encouragement.<\/p><p>Our 1% campaign involves engaging with both the general public and with corporate Ireland - engagement of a fairly pressing nature in the case of the latter - to get the figure of 0.1% up to at least the standard 1%.  We are hoping to drag in the inward investment contingent, which includes IBM, Google, Facebook and so on, to get it to do in Ireland what it is doing elsewhere.  It is not enough for these companies to make their money in Ireland but do their philanthropy somewhere else.  They must be encouraged to give us a share, because a little from them would make a huge difference to us.  We have also been asking Irish citizens to do more.  It is a matter for the Government to devise a more satisfactory tax regime.  That is way beyond our reach and something we cannot really discuss.  What we are saying is that the objective, in the meantime, is to drag the money out of these companies and individuals.  We would take &euro;600 million today if we got the contribution we are seeking from one in ten of our targets.  That becomes &euro;6 billion if we get all 400.  In other words, the figures here are potentially large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000013#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Flannery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":261,"content":"<p>My observation from working in the social sector in the United Kingdom is that part of the problem for the sector here is that it has not professionalised.  In London, by contrast, in the late 1990s and the 2000s, there was a move towards professionalisation and an acceptance, for instance, that it is necessary to pay decent wages to attract the right people, people who will bring in 20, 100 or even 150 times their wage in funding.  By the international standards I have seen, the sector here is still very amateur.  It is too small, there is not sufficient scale, and we see a hang-up on wages.  It is fine to claim that we cannot pay comparable wages in this country, but one must then accept there will be a deficit in terms of professionalism.<\/p><p>  The delegates have set out a funding mechanism whereby contributors would pay &euro;5 million in the first year and &euro;1 million per year for a further ten years, giving a total of &euro;15 million.

They are essentially buying more time in Ireland for a sum which to them would be relatively insignificant.  For others lower down the wealth scale, however, it is a more expensive proposition because it is a set amount.  Did the forum consider whether rather than having an absolute contribution, it might be more helpful to look at a percentage of tax avoided?  In the case, for example, of a person who currently avoids paying &euro;100 million in tax, the offer might be that he or she would be eligible for the additional days if that figure were reduced to 85%.  That type of mechanism would potentially bring in a lot more people and in the case of those earning the megabucks, and avoiding megabucks in tax payment, there would be scope to recoup a lot more than &euro;15 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000014#N00200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I remind members and delegates that we have run over time on this slot.

Mr. Flannery has largely answered the point.  There is something of a misconception that there is no correlation between philanthropy and job creation.  What social entrepreneurs and others in the social sector are ultimately trying to do is solve problems.  There are jobs in solving problems, as  illustrated by the fact that 100,000 are currently employed in the sector.  I agree that the sector has not professionalised in the same way as its counterpart in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  The Deputy highlighted a problem of meanness in the corporate sector and among high net worth individuals.  It is very clear that a cultural shift has to happen in this regard.  I do not believe it is the case that people are inherently mean; it is simply that, culturally, it is not how things are done here.  Likewise, a cultural shift is required in the citizens sector.  We are talking, therefore, about two culture shifts.  It is important to remember that there is a great deal of job creation in the citizens sector.  There was a period through the 1990s where, in the 12 most developed economies in the world, the citizens sector was outstripping other sectors for job creation by a factor of three to one.

The thinking behind our proposal is that we go with something very simple, namely, a contribution of &euro;5 million to a philanthropic endeavour which would be reasonably specified and, in addition, &euro;10 million extra tax to the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy is suggesting that this could be beyond the capacity of some of the people we are targeting.

I represent the radical wing of the party that wants a not-for-profit economy.  I am very much in favour of the concept and I fully recognise the importance of the work done by the not-for-profit sector.  Like everyone else, however, I am surprised by the size of the sector.  The latter is a positive and if the sector is that big, if it works, if it creates employment, if it does good and if it solves problems, then perhaps consideration should be given to running the entire economy on a not-for-profit basis.  We might be in a far better place than we are at present if the economy was run in that way.  In circumstances where we are in dire need of employment and investment, it would be difficult to be opposed to or critical of anything that would increase investment and create employment in a sector such as that in which our guests are involved.  I am, therefore, hugely sympathetic to what our guests are trying to do.<\/p><p>  I must also consider the other side of the matter, however.  I refer to the fact that in order to develop their sector, our guests are proposing that we should incentivise people who, in some cases, are tax exiles and who possess obscene amounts of wealth which they should not have and on which they pay very little tax.  It is being suggested that we should reward or incentivise those to whom I refer in order to obtain money from them which they should be investing in our economy in any event.  It was stated that we should \"drag it out of them\".  I would be fully in favour of dragging this money out of them.  However, it seems that what our guests are proposing is not that it should be dragged out of them but rather that we should beg them for it and reward them for giving it.  If we were to do the latter, it would have the potential to really grate on the nerves of people who are pretty sickened by the gross inequalities of wealth.  They are very sickened by the idea of enormously wealthy tax exiles being granted that status in the first instance.  I suspect they would be quite angry that those individuals should somehow benefit from doing something which most citizens believe they should be doing through the tax system in any event.  How do our guests reconcile this problem?<\/p><p>  I am not the only person who is of the view that this is a problem.  I will not mention any names but we all know the identities of some of those to whom I refer.  There is genuine fury about super-wealthy tax exiles and tax refugees who pay so little tax.  The same could be said in respect of corporations.  People's fury could be intensified even further if they read our guests' report.  While it is not possible to generalise about all of those involved, the report seems to indicate that we have - or damn near have - the meanest and greediest super-rich individuals and corporations in the western world.  They are certainly meaner and greedier than their counterparts in comparable countries in Europe and in the United States.  That is pretty shocking, particularly when one considers that they get such a good deal on their tax.  How would our guests respond to what I believe is a real problem in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000015#O00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373468100,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their comments.  I spent all my professional working life in the not-for-profit sector and I am also a firm believer in it.  I am of the view that it can bring together the best practices of the private and public sectors in order to deliver a really good product in the context of value for money and properly motivated service.  It can do so in a way that neither the for-profit sector nor the public sector - which is subject to other difficulties - operating on its own can do.<\/p><p>  I have been considering and talking about this matter for most of my life.  The tax system is what it is and we did not design it.  If a small island such as Ireland had a way to benefit fully from all of its capital and income generation potential, then its needs could be much more easily satisfied.  However, Ireland operates in a global economy.  As politicians, Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues have at least some opportunity to work away at it on occasion and to put forward their points of view.  If the Deputy were in government, then he would have an even better opportunity of doing so.  That, however, is the way the system works.  We are outside that and all we can do is accept matters as they stand.  We can, however, highlight the fact that there is more than one way to distribute income and surplus resources in a society.  The one thing we have never considered in this country - the facts, as we found them, prove this - is that those at corporate level, high-net-worth individuals and people at government level can be persuaded that their surplus resources should be distributed for the improvement of humanity and society and the creation of social cohesion.  Even within the capitalist system, there are arguments for doing that.  Capital can exist and thrive better where there is a socially-cohesive society in which there are no extremes of poverty or hardship and where everybody obtains a fair or reasonable share.<\/p><p>  In other countries such as the United States, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg, to name but a few, there has been a huge development of philanthropy alongside pretty advanced social democratic models of government.  Those models have enshrined many of the principles which we endeavour to enshrine in Ireland.  Perhaps they are more advanced and do it better than we do.  Philanthropy is thriving in the countries to which I refer because there will always be winners.  What we are saying to the winners is that if they have surplus income they should consider - while they are alive - distributing it for socially useful purposes such as the elimination of disease or poverty, the promotion of peace, the creation of employment, etc.  This country has huge problems with regard to poverty and a lack of employment and these will obtain for a number of years.<\/p><p>  We have been charged with implementing the recommendations of the forum, which is an advisory body to the Government and which cannot do the latter.  We are trying to challenge the system in this country to do a great deal more.  We are also trying to get across the message that we are not as good as we believe ourselves to be.  Irish people love to be praised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000015#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Flannery","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373468700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It is human nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Mortell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373468700,"counter":276,"content":"<p>It is human nature but we probably got a slight overdose of that characteristic.

That would be an interesting thing to do.  We should also focus on high-net-worth individuals.  There is a huge movement in the United States where people who are very wealthy are putting half of their total wealth into trusts and foundations and distributing to good causes while they are alive.  It is inspired by people like Chuck Feeney whom I mentioned.  That movement is taking off.  In Canada about 15 years ago philanthropy was almost discovered there and it is now a huge force in its economy and society.  We can discover it now in Ireland and in 15 years time it could be a very large force for good in our society and economy.  It could help to bring all these wealthy people back into a much more meaningful, creative and dynamic relationship with our country.  All our rich people, all our companies in Ireland and all the inward investment companies here could participate and do their share.  As was stated in our campaign, the entire citizenry would be involved and therefore it would be very dynamic.

Before Mr. Flannery responds, I wish to say a few words.  All the delegates might like to make a few comments before we conclude.  There should be as much as possible positive reasons for giving and there are many positive reasons for doing so.  We are talking about incentives for giving but when we reflect on how the Irish people have acted in times of crisis, there is probably a groundswell into which we can tap and the people could be taught how to give on a long-term basis.  Even after having been in politics for 12 years I probably still have a remarkable capacity to delude myself, but I think that people are full of good rather than being motivated by self-interest alone.  All the delegates would have seen that in the work they do.  I am talking about the remarkable capacity of people to do something good for their fellow man.  It is a question of tapping into that.  I do not see things as being quite as negative.  Admittedly, we have also seen far too many cases where ethical behaviour has been well below standard in all parts of Irish society but such behaviour can also be seen across the world.  We should not focus so much on such negative behaviour, rather we should focus on the positive behaviour.  Even though Deputy Boyd Barrett said that perhaps we are allowing ourselves to be held over a barrel, life is like that.  Many people who are strongly influential in Irish society and global society feel they have that power already.  We should try to modulate it a bit and do the best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468700,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman is opening up a can of worms here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P01000","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Indeed, and that is before we even start to talk about human nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P01100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468700,"counter":285,"content":"<p>We are voting at 2 a.m., so we do have the time to go into this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P01200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468700,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Flannery to respond to some of the questions that have been asked and the delegates to give their concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P01300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373468700,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their contributions.  We wholly accept the validity of all the points that were made but we would also assert the absolute validity of the case we are making, namely, that there is real and present danger in this area.  We have a small window of opportunity to put some provisions in place in order that we can begin to prevent a greater hardship occurring when all this money moves out of Ireland in the next two to three years or whenever.  This issue has been identified in time and there is an opportunity to resolve it.  We have done something more fundamental in bringing forward the report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising and in trying to implement it.  It reveals a huge gap in our national culture and in our way of behaving.  We hope that Ireland will discover the values of the not-for-profit sector in society, its effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with problems, in creating employment and in speeding up our recovery but also bringing to that recovery values which will enable us to avoid the excesses of our last experience.  If this generation of politicians and citizens learns anything, it must be that.  We got success and we built on it and then, collectively, we blew it.  However, we have kept our head and we are thinking and learning from what happened.  We will the learn lessons and will not do that again.  We will build much more solidly and on a better and more long-term basis in the future with better values.<\/p><p>  The concept of giving is where people do more than just what the law requires them to do and where this would be part of their culture and their thinking as individuals, families, communities, organisations, citizens, professionals and workers.  Furthermore, those who are successful would build that into their life model and they would be of additional assistance to those who were not successful, and they would do it over and above what the State demands of them.  It may well be that the State should demand that anyway but, none the less, we are dealing with the world as it is and we want to make the system that we have work much better.<\/p><p>  I would hope that the members would say that there is a great deal of work to do done on this kind of thinking.  It moves us into a slightly edgy area.  There are real possibilities here.  The 400 or 4,000 people who have significant resources should not be left outside the demands we are trying to make, rather they should be fully included.  At a minimum we should seriously investigate how this might work.  In response to Deputy Donnelly's point, I believe that at the beginning of the process it should kept as simple as possible.  I can see the value of what he said, namely, that if it is decided that the contribution would be 10% or 15% and if somebody has as much in that respect, that it would be equivalently moderated and that person would contribute a great deal more.  Perhaps that could be an eventual outcome of the process, but at least we want to bring the principle working into the process.<\/p><p>  Human nature being what it is, if we could get this money, I would not see this as those people taking advantage of us.  Such a measure should be drafted in such a way that this would not happen.  It would be us making a significant demand on them to do much more and not just to say we do not like them but that they are enjoying certain facilities in our society and for that we want them to do much more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000016#P01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Flannery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373469300,"counter":289,"content":"<p>From listening to what has been said, we have a philanthropy model in Ireland but it is not sustainable.

What is at issue is the structure of the model and that one spreads it over a large number of philanthropists through The Ireland Fund and other funds.  A philanthropy cliff of &euro;50 million a year is coming down the tracks with a threat over the future of a considerable number of worthwhile projects that could be deprived of funding.

It is not about begging; it is a trade.  This is a product that can be sold.  It is a good trade for the citizen.  I remember Chuck Feeney saying that people used to come to him looking for &euro;1 million.  That was the price point which they always used to request.  He asked if one had ever considered writing a cheque for &euro;1 million; putting down the six zeros after the one.  It is an incredibly difficult thing to do because it is a huge sum of money.

On whether anyone has been able to do a risk assessment, I can just speak for One Foundation which is supporting approximately 20 organisations in the current year 20% of which are seriously at risk of closure or are becoming so small that they really can no longer make an impact.  Approximately 20% have successfully replaced our money and will be fine and 60% are currently busy cutting back, hopefully in strategic ways that will allow them to grow again very quickly.  Cutting back means cutting services and jobs which fundamentally affects the missions the organisations are trying to achieve.  That is just a quick and not very representative view but it does give an indication of what is happening.  A total of 80% of the 20 organisations are at risk in one way or another.<\/p><p>  To return to the broader agenda, we have talked a lot about whether we have the meanest rich people in western Europe, where our corporations stand, whether we give at all and what it all means.  We have danced around the issue of whether we have a giving culture and, if we do not, how we can build one.  There are short-term issues and long-term issues.  We need to build a giving culture and it must have a broad base across the population involving individuals, corporations and others.  We have referred to the plan that has been prepared for investment in Irish jobs.  We have a plan that is based on international evidence and we have a group of people promoting the plan.  Today&rsquo;s meeting is part of the process of selling it.<\/p><p>  We must build a giving culture but that will not happen overnight.  Second, we have a short-term problem, due to the need to find &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million in the next 12 months to 18 months.  That is why we have come forward with this proposal which might not be popular but if the committee does not like it we would like to know what is plan B.  We do not have a plan B.  There is a need to focus on the short term and the long term as the short term leads to the long term.  We must get to a sustainable level but there is a short-term pot of money that we might be able to get through a short-term measure.  I do not think it creates dependence.  That is not our goal.<\/p><p>  We talked a lot about super-rich people and all the tax forgone.  If we could have got the data on the tax forgone, we would have presented it to the committee.  We do not know the amount involved, how much money those 400 people make or how much tax they would pay if they did come back home to pay their tax and what the benefit would be.  Therefore, we do not really know how much we could get and how much we could deploy for good causes.  If the committee could get the data that would be great as it could better help shape our plan.  In the meantime it is important that we have taken a shot at what might be the price point.  It might be too high or too low.  Much of the debate suggests that it might be too low but there is an equal risk that perhaps it is too high.  The fact that we do not really know is something the committee must not forget in reaching its conclusions.  Perhaps that is why a trial would make sense.<\/p><p>  I encourage the committee to give due consideration to the issue.  The \"Why now?\" question is very strong given the recent removal of money from the system.  It is important to bear in mind the good that could be done.  The first step in that direction is to build a giving culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071000017#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Mortell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373469300,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I could not put it any better than Ms Mortell.  It is so important that we build a giving culture.  That is how the situation will change.  It takes time to change culture.  The way we can make things happen is to see good examples of what can be done really well.  The best example of that is to continue the extraordinary social innovation and the work the sector is doing.  If the sector does not survive it will be hard to be motivated or inspired by negativity.  The culture change will come if we continue to support those organisations that help us.<\/p><p>  What is important is how we frame the proposal.  It is not about rewarding people or giving them something.  We must demand things from people as citizens of this country because we need them.  As we said to each other before giving our presentation, we are asking for help.  It is hard to ask for help but we genuinely need help.  This is not just about &euro;50 million; there is a problem currently.  We need help.  There will be public outcry if more organisations that are delivering services that are required are lost.  We must look at the two sides of this story and what might anger the public on both sides.<\/p><p>  I agree with the point made about whether there is an alternative.  We are open to it.  If there is a pot of money at the end of the rainbow we are up for it.  There is no problem in trying.  Various approaches could be taken.

Since Ms Olive Hempenstall left we have not had an adviser, which has been a hindrance to the committee, and Mr. Deady's experience will be very supportive to the committee.  He will be in touch with the Department on a regular basis to let us know what is happening and we will have far speedier communication.  We are delighted to have Mr. Deady, albeit on a temporary basis.  He will help the committee with its work programme given his experience as a former diplomat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000002#A00600","speaker":"974"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unethical Organ Harvesting in China: Discussion","time":1373463000,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000002#A00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I remind witnesses, members and those in the gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference even on silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.

On behalf of the committee I welcome them all.  I also welcome those in the Gallery.  Members of the delegation were in contact with the committee some time ago, after which we met and arranged for them to come before the committee today.  They attended a conference in DCU in recent days and we are delighted they are here to make a presentation.  The presentation will last approximately ten minutes after which we will have a question and answer session.  Committee members are very interested in this subject, which is of grave concern to everyone.  I am sure we will have a very constructive and informative debate this afternoon on the question of forced organ harvesting.  I understand presentations will be made by Mr. David Matas and Mr. Ethan Gutmann.  A DVD and publication will be available to members after the meeting.<\/p><p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentations, I advise them they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments on the subject matters of the meeting are to be made and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000002#A00800","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373463000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us.

Mr. Kilgour and I have written two reports and a book on the subject.  I co-edited a second book with Dr. Torsten Trey in which Mr. Gutmann wrote an essay.  There is a great deal of material.<\/p><p>  I will say a few words about some of the evidence that led us to our conclusion.  We had investigators make telephone calls to Chinese hospitals and pretend to be relatives of patients in need of transplants.  The hospitals were asked whether they had organs of Falun Gong practitioners for sale on the basis that the Falun Gong exercise regime meant a Falun Gong practitioner and his or her organs would be healthy.  We got admissions on tape, in transcriptions and translated from throughout China that the hospitals had Falun Gong organs for sale.<\/p><p>  When we spoke with people who got out of prison and out of China, both Falun Gong and non-Falun Gong, they told us that Falun Gong practitioners were systematically blood tested and had their organs examined while the non-Falun Gong were not.  This examination was not for any health benefit, as they were being tortured to recant.  Such an examination is necessary for organ transplants, as blood types must be compatible.<\/p><p>  We spoke with patients who went to China for transplants.  They told us of secrecy and heavy military involvement.  Transplants were handled quickly on order.  They booked their trips far in advance and received heart, liver, kidney or lung transplants within a few days.  Except in the case of kidney transplants, which a person can survive, this meant that people were being killed on order for their organs.<\/p><p>  Another form of evidence that we considered was the numbers.  After the US, China leads the world in terms of transplant volumes.  Until recently, however, it did not have an organ donation system.  Its current system only produces tiny numbers.  From where were the organs coming?  Eventually, the Chinese admitted that they were coming from prisoners who had been sentenced to death and executed, but they will not say how many people are sentenced to death and executed in China.  In light of the facts that there is no national organ distribution system, people must be executed within seven days of their sentencing and the high rate of hepatitis in prisons, approximately 100,000 people would need to be sentenced to death and executed every year to supply the volume of transplants being performed.  This is plainly not the case.  It is not even close.  Even the largest estimates put the figure at 5,000 or 6,000 executions per year.  There is no plausible explanation for the sources of organs that can explain the discrepancy between volumes.<\/p><p>  A fifth factor was the extreme cover-up in which the Chinese Government was involved.  Not only has it never disclosed death penalty statistics, but it started destroying data as soon as we cited them.  For example, when we started citing the aggregate volumes on the liver transplant registry, the Chinese Government took those data down.  We started quoting hospital websites' advertisements about the prices of their organs, their speed and the money they were making on organs.  The Government took those data down.  We quoted Chinese doctors, but the Chinese Government put out video tapes denying what we had quoted them as saying even though their materials were still posted on Chinese websites.<\/p><p>  This cover-up highlights a phenomenon.  Whatever one thinks of our study, it does not fall to us to explain the sources of Chinese organs, but to the Chinese Government.  This is the international standard of accountability, transparency and traceability.  The Chinese Government does not conform to it.<\/p><p>  The sixth and final reason for reaching our conclusion that I will mention at this meeting - our written materials contain many more reasons - is the absence of precautions that should be in place to prevent these types of abuse.  The precautions were not present in China or anywhere else in the world.  Transplant tourism was practically possible and not legally blocked.  When we started our work, it was not even blocked by ethical standards.  Mr. Kilgour and I, joined recently by Mr. Gutmann and others, have been urging parliamentarians and policy makers around the world to put in place mechanisms to prevent this sort of abuse from happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Matas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373463000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to participate in this profoundly important hearing.  Beginning in 2006, I began conducting comprehensive interviews with medical professionals, Chinese law enforcement personnel and more than 50 refugees from the Laogai system, that is, black jails, labour camps, detention centres, mental hospitals and so forth, to piece together my research on how mass harvesting from prisoners of conscience evolved in China.  Most of my research is available and I am happy to supply references.<\/p><p>  I will provide a short timeline.  The organ harvesting of prisoners began in the 1980s.  In 1994, we have evidence that the first live organ harvests were performed on the execution grounds at Xinjiang in north-west China.  Following the Ghulja massacre in 1997, we have evidence that the first political prisoners, specifically ethnically Muslim Uighur activists, were harvested on behalf of high-ranking Chinese cadres.  In 1999, Chinese state security launched its largest action of scale since the Cultural Revolution, namely, the eradication of Falun Gong.  By 2001, Chinese military hospitals were unambiguously targeting select Falun Gong prisoners for organ harvesting.  By 2005, overall transplant numbers and the refugees with whom I have spoken suggest that the number of Falun Gong being harvested increased dramatically.  In early 2006, the <i>Epoch Times<\/i>, basically a newspaper largely comprising Falun Gong practitioners, revealed the first charges of organ harvesting of Falun Gong.  This was followed that summer by the distribution of the Kilgour-Matas report.  In 2012, Wang Lijun attempted to defect at the US consulate in Chengdu.  Two weeks later, information surfaced that he had overseen thousands of organ transplants while his boss, Bo Xilai, ran the shop in Liaoning province.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373463600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Is there any evidence of organ tourism out of Ireland to China?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000004#C00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373463600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>That is one of the big unanswered questions and I will not pretend to have an answer to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>What about the UK?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000004#C00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373463600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>One of our significant failings is that we are constantly approached by graduate students who claim they want to do something in this area and, although we have asked them to examine organ tourism from the UK, we have got nowhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373463600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Perhaps I could add something to that.  The problem we face is not just preventing this practice but also finding out about it, as there is no compulsory reporting.  There is not even a voluntary reporting system.  Some of the legislative reforms introduced around the world, such as in France or Israel, require compulsory reporting.  We know there is transplant tourism out of the British Isles because people are disappearing from the waiting lists without having died.  There is no official information on where these people have gone or where they got organs.  One can cross a border to get a transplant and it is not necessarily an abuse; whether it is an abuse depends on whether the person is complicit in organ sourcing when the source does not consent or where the organ is being bought.

We are a very small state and the European Parliament, its committees and political groups are the representatives of 28 member states, so it is in a much better position to put forward a case.

The sources of organs in China do not consent and, for example, the Falun Gong members are not asked to donate their organs.  They are not even being told they are to be killed for their organs.  Nevertheless, these people are executed through organ extraction.  That claim comes from my research and Mr. Gutmann has similar findings for Uighurs.  Even the consent of prisoners sentence to death is not meaningful because of the environment, and those in the transplantation profession argue that organs should not be sourced from prisoners sentenced to death.<\/p><p>  There are a number of different initiatives going ahead in Ireland, with one being the human tissue Bill.  It was proposed in 2009.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Bill 2013 is also dealing with the issue.  The European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs intended for Transplantation) Regulations 2012 were also passed last year.  All three deal with this issue but none deals with the matter in the extra-territorial context.  In Irish legislation, the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 penalises participation in female genital mutilation done abroad if the person is Irish and returns to this State after the crime.  That is the sort of legislation Ireland needs in dealing with transplant abuse and lack of consent abroad.  These are both horrendous practices and could be treated in the same manner in terms of legislation.<\/p><p>  I have been to the European Parliament a couple of times and I have visited the European Commission.  Most recently, I attended the European Parliament in December last year and I said to those people what I am saying to the members now about extra-territorial legislation.  The response was that the European Parliament does not legislate but rather recommends to member states, and if something is to be done we must go to the member states.  Some months ago a policy paper emerged from the Italian bioethics council, which is part of the Italian Government, and it analysed the problem from a European perspective.  It indicated that this is a problem both in Italy and across Europe.<\/p><p>  There are different ways of dealing with this.  There was mention of dialogue between Europe and China, the last instance of which was in June.  We met representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday and spoke about that dialogue.  There are many instances of such dialogue and, frankly, they are not very useful.  They may be useful in showing concern but they are not useful in moving China's policy.  This is not just a China problem but it is a global issue.  It would be wonderful if we could end this abuse in China but it is certainly within our power to end complicity with the abuse in our own countries.  We should be focusing on that.<\/p><p>  When it comes to transplant tourism, China is not necessarily hostile.  After our report emerged, the country changed policy in order to give priority to locals.

To some extent the Chinese Government, or at least the Chinese medical establishment, appears to be offering the West a deal that it will end the practice over some kind of timeframe, but that depends on how the West behaves.  It could be fast or slow.  In other words, it could be between three and five years or one and two years.  Various statements have been made and it depends on whether we ask rude questions.<\/p><p>  Another part of the deal is that there will be no verification and no mention of the prisoners of conscience problem.  That is done and it is finished, if it happened.  Their view is that it never happened.  The West is expected to accept that the party has certain taboos and lines that it cannot cross.  It is not even clear that if we do not mention the prisoners of conscience problem we will have reform.  How can one reform something when one has not reached the root of the problem or acknowledged it as a possibility?  We do not know that it would affect the prisoners of conscience problem.<\/p><p>  I must say that Mr. Matas and I - I do not want to put words in his mouth - are here today for the prisoners of conscience, not because we are concerned about prisoners, rapists and murderers filling out the proper forms.  I have outlined the deal and the West can either accept the offer in exactly the way the Chinese want or with reservations.  The way to signal that we are accepting it with reservations is to stop and do what Israel has done.  Israel has been the only country to stop all organ tourism.  Ending organ tourism makes the statement that no one can get an organ from China until we know, in explicit detail, where organs are sourced.  Five years down the line that may be true and, if so, it will be an historical point.  I have outlined my recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373464200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe asked whether legislative proposals had been successful.  Different countries have produced a number of legislative proposals but the only enacted legislation that we advocate is Israel's legislation, which has been very successful.  Before a report came out, Israel funded people to go to China for transplants and not just aftercare and transportation.  Israel paid Chinese hospitals costs from its health bill.  After a report came out, Israel shut down organ tourism completely, legislated against it, criminalised it, required reporting and penalised brokerage.  Its policy completely flip-flopped, from virtually everyone who needed a transplant in Israel going to China to nobody travelling.  Now there are no cases of people from Israel travelling to China for transplants.  The initiative has not stopped the killing of Falun Gong members for their organs but has stopped complicity by countries abroad, or at least by Israel.

We might be able to produce a similar model.  I tabled a motion but it is fairly weak and is couched in quite diplomatic terms.

My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues added their names to my motion but they have been omitted for various reasons.  Perhaps it was my fault.<\/p><p>   We got the answer to the question of why we do not stop it immediately.  It is because the Chinese have acknowledged it is happening.  Mr. Matas used the chilling phrase \"these people are executed through organ extraction.\"  I presume that means that organs are removed while people are still alive and they die as a result of the process.  In recent weeks I have learned that I will require a liver transplant but I would not wish, in any sense, for this kind of thing.  Most decent people would prefer not to get an organ from this source and take the consequences.  That would certainly be my view.  I would not accept an organ obtained in this way.  <\/p><p>  I agree with the delegation that organ harvesting should be criminalised in the same way as child trafficking for sex abuse purposes.  Harvesting is mass murder and echoes what the Nazis did during the Holocaust.  <\/p><p>  Finally, I deeply regret the tone of the briefing note from the Department of Foreign Affairs, which was overwhelmingly concerned with trade.  It also referred to the \"autonomous\" region of Tibet.

That policy never went through Parliament and nobody was consulted.  This committee was never consulted.

The business of testing transplant patients in China is a real problem.  One does not know if it is someone with a Falun Gong organ or a prisoner's organ.  The person certainly does not have a family organ because there are almost no donations.

There is the China we see and in which I have operated as I lived in Beijing for years.  We mentioned freedom of the Internet and so forth.  In July 2009 all of Xinjiang was cut off from the Internet for nine months.  It is a massive area of the country and the impact on business was unbelievable.  It is a very different picture in different provinces and places.  In many cases, we are almost talking about a series of different nations.  A rights consciousness has grown as Chinese people become more sophisticated every day.  Having some money in their pockets helps a lot.  It is also true the self-suppression or self-censorship promoted by the Chinese Government is incredibly successful.  Certain issues are not touched on at all and this is one of them.  Having said that, after Bo Xilai was arrested and while the leadership crisis was in full swing, an interesting thing happened.  For one night only the words \"live harvest\" were searchable on Baidu, the Chinese Google.  One was able to read anything and lots of people did.  The people who could speak English read a lot of American congressional testimony.  That was some kind of stunt being pulled by one faction against another, probably asking, \"How far do you want to go with this?\" or \"Do you want to drive the Communist Party down?\" or \"What is the deal?\"  China is still a very controlled state.  Of course, the NSA is looking at many things and there is surveillance ongoing all over the world.  The difference here is that the surveillance has massive consequences for those who slip up.  Falun Gong was an extremely powerful and strong movement and surprisingly adept at surveying.  From the Chinese perspective, it became a toxic acid which had to be destroyed.  They could not even be released from prison.

I mention also extraterritorial legislation, drug exports, the Confucius Institute and emigration controls.  There are a number of ways to approach the problem.  What is important is not necessarily choosing one over another but choosing something to show one is aware of the problem and trying to come to grips with it, even if it is just to take the matter to the European Union to try to get it, as a group, to deal with it.  I think Brussels is looking for some leadership on the periphery before it gets started on it.<\/p><p>  I have appeared before the Scottish and UK Parliaments.

Ireland may seem small in relation to China, but China has the same attitude to Ireland and, therefore, it is not that concerned about what Ireland does.

Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked whether there has been any breakdown in reticence.  I should say that the issue automatically comes up because of the universal periodic review of the UN Human Rights Council, which takes place every three years.  China's review will take place on 22 October next.  Ireland, as a current member of that council, and every other country will have an opportunity to raise this issue publicly on that occasion.  Three years ago, Canada was the only country to raise the Falun Gong issue.  Many countries raised peripheral or related issues such as freedom of religion, death penalty statistics and re-education through labour camps.  One should take advantage of the many ways of dealing with the issue.  The UN has dealt with it through the rapporteur on torture and religious intolerance and the committee on torture.  I think that is helpful.  The US State Department, through its country reports, dealt with it for the first time this year after the Wang Lijun defection.  It has certainly taken that step.  I have been working on this issue for seven years since our report first came out.  This is my second appearance before a committee of the Irish Parliament.  I do not know if any of the members who are here now were in attendance the last time I came here, which was in 2007.  It is great to be back, even if the people have changed.  Over the years, I have found that there is an increasing willingness to do things on this issue, and to confront China about it, as people become more familiar with the issue.<\/p><p>  The response of the Chinese Government when it comes to Falun Gong is as bad as it always was.  I accept and endorse what Mr. Gutmann has said about the existence of two Chinas.  As I see it, the two Chinas are the State and the party.  We all see the state apparatus, but we do not see the party, which is really running the show.  Every state function has a party instructor who instructs the state functionary.  All of that is done behind closed doors.  The party does not issue edicts.  It has a propaganda campaign against the Falun Gong.  The apparatus known as the 610 Office is running the persecution.  It is done behind closed doors.  It is not a public function.  The West may not even see what is going on and what the Communist Party is doing.  If we are used to understanding China, we can see the after-effects of what happens.  Over the years, Huang Jiefu, who was the deputy minister of health and is now in charge of a special organ transplant institution in China, has become the front person on organ harvesting.  When we first did our report, the initial position of the Government of China was that all organs were coming from donations, even though there was no donation system.  Huang Jiefu is a little more sophisticated than that.  He acknowledges, and he has got the whole system to acknowledge, that pretty much everything is coming from prisoners.  He is not prepared to admit that it is coming from prisoners of conscience.  Until recently, he would say nothing when he was asked about Falun Gong.  The questions have become so persistent that he has finally denied it, for obvious political reasons.<\/p><p>  The official Chinese line is to admit that organs are being sourced from prisoners, to accept that sourcing organs from prisoners is wrong and to say that it will stop doing so if it is given some time.  As Mr. Gutmann has said, the little bargain they want to strike is \"forget about what we have done in the past and help us get to where we should be in the future\".  As a human rights advocate, I appreciate the comment that was made about international institutions.  I would say that human rights do not belong to international institutions or governments - they belong to individuals everywhere around the world.  The way to ensure human rights are respected is for people around the world who have such rights to assert them rather than relying on institutions or governments to do so.  I am not strategically or temperamentally inclined to avoid confrontation with China.  If one is so inclined, one can still find ways of pursuing this issue - for example, by saying \"Okay, we will help you stop sourcing organs from prisoners,\" or \"Okay, we agree that Chinese people should be a priority and we will stop transplant tourism\".  Both of those approaches are in line with the Chinese agenda.  There are different ways of pursuing this matter.  It would be a better world if China were to stop sourcing organs from prisoners, but like Mr. Gutmann I do not accept that it would be enough.  They have to acknowledge what has happened and they have to punish the wrongdoers.  I would not be happy with the ending of the sourcing of organs from prisoners alone, but it is certainly something worth pushing for.  China would agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071000008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Matas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373466000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Can I add a quick statement on the question of what movement is being made in America?  The State Department has mentioned this for the first time.  It seems to have happened in response to the information that Wang Lijun brought with him to the Chengdu consulate in the middle of the night.  It is also true that 106 Congressmen signed a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that was sent to the State Department.  The letter, which was quite explicit, asked for any information on whether Wang Lijun might have been involved in live organ harvesting, probably from practitioners of Falun Gong.  A few years ago, I would have said the State Department would never move on that.  Now I do not know how it will respond.  Things have shifted - I cannot quite explain why - and there is now much more passion about this issue in Congress.  For example, Voice of America, which is congressionally funded, started reporting on organ harvesting for the first time this year.  It had never done that before.  According to most experts, China is entering a period of 3% growth.  Its recession came much later than all the other recessions.

Copies of the Revised Estimates for the health Votes and briefing documents by subhead on the two Votes have been provided to Deputies.  The annual Estimates of each Vote are being reconfigured along programme lines to ensure greater transparency in Government expenditure.  The Department of Health is working towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the health Votes to reflect this.

The primary aim in targeting savings is to cut the cost of services and not the services themselves.  This will be achieved largely through efficiencies and reconfiguration under the existing Croke Park agreement, the new Haddington Road agreement, new charging arrangements for private patients in public hospitals and curtailing the growing cost of pharmaceuticals.  The required savings have been incorporated in the HSE service plan which I approved on 9 January and are recognised in these Revised Estimates before the committee today.<\/p><p>  Vote 38, which relates to the Department itself, provides for gross expenditure of &euro;244 million.  This comprises &euro;16 million capital and &euro;228 million for current expenditure.  While this is a slight increase on the outturn position for 2012, it represents a 25% reduction on the 2012 budget.  All health agencies funded by my Department were required to achieve further efficiency savings this year, with the Department's administrative budget being reduced in line with the moratorium on recruitment and the provision for legal costs and statutory inquiries also reduced.  The provision for the National Treatment Purchase Fund was also significantly reduced pending consideration of its future role in the context of the structural reforms set out in Future Health.  Part of the fund was surrendered to the Exchequer as part of the overall cash reductions required and part was transferred to the HSE.<\/p><p>  In addition, a sum of &euro;30 million has been provided under the drugs initiative.  The majority of this expenditure is allocated to local and regional drugs task forces.  Last December, a number of measures were set out following a review of drugs task forces with the aim of better equipping the drugs task forces to respond to the current pattern of substance misuse and provide for the extension of their remit to include alcohol addiction.  As measures to address the abuse of alcohol remain under consideration by the Government, the final report on the review has not yet been agreed.  I do, however, anticipate that the final report will include further measures to improve management, oversight and control of funding allocated by the drugs task forces. <\/p><p>  Vote 39 is the Health Service Executive Vote.  The gross provision for the HSE is &euro;13.774 billion comprising an Exchequer contribution of &euro;12.312 billion plus appropriations-in-aid of &euro;1.461 billion.  As in recent years, in setting the Estimate for the HSE, tough decisions were taken in the context of the need to take corrective action in respect of public spending.  The health service must, of necessity, contribute to the expenditure reductions required in 2012 but the Government's objective has always been to ensure that these reductions are achieved in a way that secures the best possible outcomes for those in receipt of services, with a particular focus on protecting services for the most vulnerable.  To protect services, we need to reduce costs and improve productivity.<\/p><p>  As with last year, the significant cost of drugs and medicines has been targeted for comprehensive savings measures.  In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced, primarily through pricing and supply agreements with the pharmaceutical industry.  However, further efforts are required to control drug expenditure.  Last year, a new pricing agreement was concluded with both the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which represents the research-based pharmaceutical sector, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI, which represents the generic industry.  The IPHA agreement, with a value of in excess of &euro;400 million over the next three years, will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions in the cost of drugs both for patients and for the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The APMI agreement provides that from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This deal represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  The reason I say that is because at the moment, many generics are nearly the same price as the brand leader when it comes off patent and, therefore, there is no real incentive for GPs to engage in that.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000003#B00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1373445000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>The Minister's ten minutes are up.

The legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Irish Medicines Board has commenced the process of reviewing an initial 20 groups of medicines, which have been prioritised on the basis that they cost the most to the State and patients, for inclusion in groups of interchangeable medicines.<\/p><p>  The 2013 Estimate also provides for further reductions to professional fees paid to GPs and pharmacists under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2009.  Overall, these reductions will save approximately &euro;70 million in a full year, savings which the Government believes are both necessary and proportionate.  In the case of GPs, fees are being reduced by 7.5% overall, which will deliver savings of &euro;38 million in a full year.  The retail mark-up paid to pharmacists under the drug payment scheme, long-term illness scheme and other schemes is also being eliminated.  This equates to a reduction of 7.67% in the average State payment to pharmacists and will save an estimated &euro;32 million in a full year.  It can be seen, therefore, that we did not just impose a straight across-the-board cut.  We did it in such a way as to get rid of perhaps some of the historical anomalies in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000003#B00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373445600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I apologise to members that we did not receive the Minister's opening statement until 9 a.m.  With regard to the briefing document, the committee secretariat asks departmental officials a week in advance of meetings to submit documentation.

A sum of &euro;781 million was cut in this year's budget, more than &euro;750 million in budget 2012 and an additional &euro;130 million in August 2012, and all that followed a cut of &euro;1 billion in 2011.  Along with other colleagues, I have said from the beginning that such cuts were unsustainable and would cause major damage to health services and that has proven correct.<\/p><p>  In the week of the announcement of budget 2013, the Minister had to ask the D&aacute;il for an additional &euro;360 million in a Supplementary Estimate to prevent services collapsing before the end of 2012, showing once again the unsustainability of the level of cuts imposed.  In a report to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform blamed the Minister for Health for the December 2012 Supplementary Estimate and the &euro;360 million overrun.  Among the savings as distinct from cuts to services not delivered were the promised reductions in the cost of drugs.  This has not happened.  Medical card holders were made to pick up the tab when their prescription fees were increased threefold.  Both the Fine Gael and Labour parties vehemently opposed, rightly, the introduction of such prescription charges by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, but since taking office, the coalition has trebled the charges to &euro;1.50 per item and increased the monthly maximum payment from &euro;10 to &euro;19.50.  The Minister failed to deliver the promised reductions in the exorbitant price of medicines in the State and, instead, he is passing on the cost to patients with higher prescription charges and the increase in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme from &euro;132 to &euro;144 per month.  This latter cut is yet another attack on families and individuals on the margins of poverty, with whom we are all familiar.  These people's incomes are just above the threshold for qualification for a medical card.  They must bear the full cost of GP visits and up to &euro;144 per month for medication.  They were hit with the full range of cuts in budget 2013, especially the PRSI increase and the child benefit reduction.<\/p><p>  The health needs of older people, in particular, were attacked in the budget.  People aged over 70 with an income of between &euro;600 and &euro;700 per week have lost their medical card and have received instead the GP only card.  All Deputies across the board will testify to the fact that medical cards are being taken from people with serious medical needs because of the harsher and tighter application of the income threshold and little compassion or discretion is being exercised in cases I have come across.  Only this week, my office was contacted by a man - I can submit the details of the case if requested - with a disability since childhood and with a serious bowel condition and consequent high medical expenses.  He had long had a medical card but it has been taken away on income grounds.  His appeal has been turned down and such experiences are increasing to the point that they are almost legion.  They are not reflected in the dry figures in this Estimate but they are the reality on the ground that I have to contend with.<\/p><p>  Government policy claims that primary care and community care are the bedrock of the health service.  I agree but these Revised Estimates will result in a reduction of 8.6% in this area between 2012 and 2013.  A Government that has pledged to extend free GP care to all and to expand primary care is going in the opposite direction and the figures confirm this.  I will revisit this when the opportunity to ask questions presents.<\/p><p>  The overall Estimate for the HSE in budget 2013 was &euro;12.32 billion.  The Revised Estimate provides for &euro;12.312 billion.  Will the Minister account for this difference?  According to a quick calculation, this amounts to approximately &euro;8 million.  Last year's bout of austerity resulted in the cutting of 950,000 home help hours.  The Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, made a claim that there was a commitment to restore these services in 2013 but spending was reduced with the allocation under subhead C1, primary care and community-led demand schemes, being reduced by 8.6%.  What is the position regarding the restoration during the remainder of 2013 of the home help hour cuts in 2012?  Those cuts have caused significant hardship to many of those most in need.  Will older people and people with disabilities whose home help hours were cut in 2012 have them restored during the remainder of this year as indicated by the junior Minister?<\/p><p>  Age Action Ireland representatives at the pre-budget forum in Dublin Castle last Friday outlined the reality of cuts for older people.  They said the feedback they received during their national consultation process in March was shocking with older people relating how they were going to bed early in the evening to stay warm or using hot water bottles to stay warm rather than turning on their heating or seriously considering the option of getting rid of pets because they could no longer afford to feed them.  I support Age Action Ireland's call on the Government to increase the funding for vital community services, home helps, home care packages, day care and meals on wheels schemes, which are intrinsic to supporting people to manage at home, something I must contend with in my own family; to cease the counterproductive policy of reducing medical care eligibility for the over 70s medical card; and to consider options to increase funding for the nursing home support scheme.<\/p><p>  Subhead C2 concerns long-term residential care.  It is contingent on the passing of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2013, Second Stage of which was taken last week.  I oppose the passage of the Bill.  The briefing document states the funding available for long-term residential care was reduced by &euro;20 million in 2013.  What are the implications of that for the remainder of the year?  What will the result be for the nursing home support scheme, the so-called fair deal?  Has that been assessed in the context of the reduced number of nursing home places supported by the scheme?  Has an impact assessment been carried out?<\/p><p>  What has been said about older people can also be applied to people with disabilities in terms of the range of cuts affecting them, many of which are in the health area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000004#C00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>When this Government was elected, there was a genuine feeling among the public that we were about to get a significantly improved health service.  Of course, that was on the back of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the current Taoiseach travelling the country, making commitments in regard to improvements in the service.  There is no doubt the previous Government had created serious difficulties for patients, people availing of services, staff and hospitals throughout the country.  There was a genuine feeling that this Government was going to improve the situation.  Of course, as often happens, the fact was a lot different.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, we have now arrived at a stage where the health services are at breaking point due to the huge austerity this Government has implemented since its election, with approximately &euro;1 billion in cuts a year in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and I believe the Minister promised another &euro;800 million to &euro;1 billion in cuts in 2014.  That is just on the expenditure side.  Hand in hand with that, there have been huge staff reductions, with thousands of health care staff having left the system or been made redundant without being replaced.  What we now have, as I said, is a system at breaking point.  It is under-funded and understaffed.  It is a system where the staff and all of our health institutions, hospitals and health centres are under pressure every hour of every day.  Despite staff working above and beyond the call of duty, the service that is being provided to the public is simply not good enough.  We now have a situation where, for example, yesterday, at the height of summer, some 230 patients were on trolleys in our emergency departments and some hospitals had as many as 19 or 20 patients on trolleys.  That is now an ongoing situation in our acute hospital services.<\/p><p>  On the community side, there have been significant cutbacks to the home help service, which, again, is an ongoing situation. We were told that people could appeal these decisions and that there would be a real appeals process.  My experience is that there is paperwork but there is no proper appeals process or assessment of the needs of individual patients.<\/p><p>  I raised the issue of the Fair Deal scheme at a previous meeting of the committee with the HSE.  There has been an increase in the residents' contribution of 7.5% per year, bringing it to 22.5% from 15%.  Of course, earlier in the year we had what I believe to be geographic discrimination against elderly people, whereby people throughout the country, with the exception of Cork and Dublin, had their applications for the Fair Deal held up.<\/p><p>  The situation I am describing applies across the system.  I would point to the example of the medical card system.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, the prescription charge was at 50 cent and was to be abolished but we now find the Minister has increased it to &euro;1.50, or &euro;19.50 per month.  There is also a very serious problem with the assessment of eligibility for medical cards, particularly for people who have health conditions.  People who in the past held medical cards on medical grounds for long periods - years on end - now find those cards being withdrawn.  I would instance the 65-69 age group, which I believe is being particularly and deliberately targeted by the HSE for the withdrawal of medical cards.  This is happening on a daily basis.  These are particularly people who have medical conditions and who are very marginally over the limit because they may have a small occupational pension.  Of course, the medical card limits have not been increased since January 2006 and are completely out of date.  This category of elderly people aged between 65 and 69 is being particularly targeted and their cards are being withdrawn on a daily basis because they are marginally over the limit, even though on medical grounds they have held cards for a significant number of years.<\/p><p>  I draw the Minister's attention to a situation I have come across frequently lately, again in the area of medical cards.  Children with disabilities who have held medical cards on medical grounds are having their medical cards withdrawn.  While it is difficult to access GP services and medication, it is even more difficult for those children and their parents to access other services which are linked to the holding of a medical card by the child, so they are being deprived of other services.  This is an issue I have asked the Minister to specifically look at because I have come across it on a number of occasions recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000005#D00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373446800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in quite rightly pointed to the reduction in our budget and staff numbers over the past several years.  He contends this has done significant damage to the health service.  He does not acknowledge that it has actually improved because reforms have been carried out.<\/p><p>  A deal was done with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which will yield savings of &euro;400 million over three years, greatly in excess of what was originally on the table.  The Deputy referred to failures to save money on drugs and failures to obtain moneys owed by private insurers.  We now have accelerated payments of &euro;125 million from insurers last year, which more than accommodates the savings that were supposed to be achieved from the private patient charge and the reduced drugs savings.<\/p><p>  Health is a demand-led service.  That demand is created because people are growing older, many more people have medical cards because our economy is in such a state, and many more babies survive problematic births but require high-tech support in their early years.  Our aging population means we will have more demand for chronic illness services in the future.  By 2041, it is projected there will be an estimated 1.3 million to 1.4 million people over the age of 65 years.  The greatest increase within that cohort will be among those over 80 years of age.<\/p><p>  I reject the contention that we are travelling in the wrong direction in health policy.  First, we will introduce free general practitioner care.  Rather than spending much time overcoming legal issues concerning the cost of high-tech drugs for long-term illnesses, we have decided to approach that area in a different way.  A paper will be going to the Government shortly.  It will not only show our bona fides but give people something real.  Up to 43% of the population, the highest number in the history of the State, is covered by medical cards, a fact contrary to the what the Deputy suggested.  Another 1% is covered by the free GP card, meaning 44% of the population is covered.  This shows that the figures are going in the right direction.<\/p><p>  The home help budget in 2013 was restored to 2011 levels.  The Deputy referred to a 8.6% reduction in primary care funding.  That is not a reduction in home help funding.  That is across primary care, where there are savings, to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in alluded, on drugs, prescribing and fees paid to professionals.<\/p><p>  I am not just telling the Deputy improvements have been made in the health service.  I can show him these improvements.  We had a 24% reduction in the number of people who had to endure long trolley waits last year.  We have had a further 9.1% reduction this year, despite the prolonged winter.  We have reached a target of 95% of endoscopies being carried out within 13 weeks, as well as the treatment of children for inpatient procedures within 20 weeks and the treatment of adults for same within nine months.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy contended that there has been a cut in the nursing home support scheme.  Ms McGuinness will address that more comprehensively later.  However, from the figures it can be seen that more than 22,000 people are being catered for.  We need to reform that as well in terms of looking at more tiered supports for people who wish to stay at home, as most people do.<\/p><p>  As for the number on trolleys, it was 569 in January 2011, averaging 400-plus per day.  We brought that down to the point at which yesterday&rsquo;s figure was 239, with 79 waiting longer than nine hours.  On the same day last year the equivalent figures were 258 and 112.  This day last year, there were 284 people on trolleys; today there are 204.  I acknowledge that there are too many people who have to endure long trolley waits, but to try and say the numbers are going up is not just disingenuous but disrespectful to the people who have done so much hard work on the front line to make this possible.  I thank them for the great work they do every day on behalf of our citizens.<\/p><p>  The clinical programme for the frail elderly meets the needs of such patients when they are admitted to hospital, and they start rehab straight way to ensure they do not end up staying in hospital in the delayed discharge category.  The stroke programme has meant that in 18 months we have gone from the bottom of the list in Europe to the top in terms of the number receiving thrombolytic drugs and therapy.  That saves one life a day.  The congestive heart failure programme is making life much better for our patients too.  As for waiting lists for outpatient services, Deputy Healy does not acknowledge that this has been the first Government to quantify the problem and address it in a real and methodical fashion.<\/p><p>  A memorandum will be going to the Government in the next week on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.

We all accept the difficulties and pressures the Government is under in terms of cost reduction and trying to remain within the budget targets.  Within that, medical cards, for example, are an issue.  While the Minister refers to the fact that 44% of the population have medical cards, they are primarily getting them based on a financial assessment of means as medical cards are awarded under that.  What is definitely happening in the system is that the discretionary element with regard to medical need is being grossly undermined.  That area must be looked at.  Previously, while there was no automatic entitlement, people who had cancer would get a medical card based on medical need.  We now have a situation where people simply cannot get medical cards on discretionary medical grounds.  That must be looked at.  While we accept that there has been an increase in the numbers, it is primarily due to the downturn in the economy, as the Minister so eloquently tells me on a regular basis.  This must be looked at in the context of the Estimates for the year to come because we cannot have a situation in which people with very serious illnesses who face massive costs and dislocation of their families cannot access the basic medical card on discretionary grounds.  That should be revisited.  The budget last year featured the withdrawal of 40,000 medical cards.  When one looks at how they are being randomly picked for assessment, it beggars belief.  It is certainly very random because we have situations in which letters are being sent to people asking them whether their financial or medical circumstances have changed.  Clearly, any cursory look at their files would suggest that they have not changed.  Is it necessary to send out such letters to those individuals?  There might be some other method of profiling people in a better way, as opposed to this random selection process that seems to be happening with the withdrawal of 40,000 medical cards.<\/p><p>  I welcome the decisions regarding high-tech drugs that the Government has decided to fund.  In respect of the savings on drugs of over &euro;440 million over three years, if one looks at the decisions that are being made, clearly there will not be as much of a saving over the next number of years as the Government had anticipated because there will be an increased cost due to the decision to cover these high-tech drugs that were not covered heretofore.  So while the Government is pencilling in savings, I do not think they will be realised to the extent the Government hopes.  Could the Minister comment on that issue?  When one looks at the Croke Park agreement and the sacrifices staff have made under the FEMPI Acts and through changes in work practices and the pressures they are under, one can see that we need to acknowledge that there is huge pressure on front-line staff.  There are huge pressures in our maternity hospital in Cork.  It was originally recommended for 5,000 births a year, was built for 7,000 and is now at about 9,500 births per year.  Many of the complex cases also come to Cork University Maternity Hospital because it has a good neonatal system and is a tertiary hospital.  If one looks at the staffing levels on key front-line areas, one can see that the situation must be revisited very quickly.  I accept the need for an embargo in broader staffing terms in the public service but in key front-line areas, it is too arbitrary at this stage.  The Government must look at opening up that area, particularly in front-line emergency departments or maternity hospitals throughout the country and other key front-line services, because they are simply unable to cope with the huge pressure and stress.  When one talks to individuals who work there, they say there is now a risk to patient safety.  That is quite clear.  Some very senior clinicians have come out and stated that they are concerned about work practices and pressures on front-line service providers and the impact on patient safety.  That must be looked at before we have a tragic case on our hands in an emergency department or maternity hospital.<\/p><p>   I know the Government has had legal difficulties with the roll-out of free GP care but the difficulty is that those legal difficulties were identified last year.  We have now waited another year and still do not have a blueprint for how the Government intends to roll out its proposals for free universal GP care over the next two and a half years if this Government runs its full term.  Will it be pencilled into the budget arithmetic in October 2013?  Will the Government have a definitive blueprint of how it plans to roll that out? If some of those issues have already been referred to, I do not want the Minister to have to be repetitive.  I can get the information from the blacks later on.  <\/p><p>  The Minister referred to us as criticising, advocating and highlighting, as an Opposition is sometimes prone to do.  It is our duty to do that.  At no stage have we been disrespectful to staff when we highlight inefficiencies and deficiencies in the health service.  We are primarily targeting the policy decisions of the Government and criticising the fallout from them.  I do not think any Deputy around here ever says that the people involved in the health service are doing anything other than giving 100% all the time, and sometimes above and beyond that in the call of duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000007#F00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1373447400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I certainly think all of us would echo the sentiment that the staff in the HSE and the Department of Health do that.

We covered some of the issues raised by Deputy Kelleher so I will not go over them again.  I will ask Ms Laverne McGuinness to answer his questions about discretionary medical cards, because I do not believe the assessments have been random, as well as issues raised by others about the nursing homes support scheme and the supposed cuts there.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the drug deal with the IPHA, which will save &euro;400 million.  We have allocated &euro;210 million which will possibly be taken up over that time for new drugs.  That is still a saving of &euro;190 million, which is far more than the amount in the original deal, around &euro;125 million.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher also raised the issue of the moratorium on staff recruitment for front-line services.  I have always said that we would maintain the moratorium but show flexibility with regard to front-line staffing when this has been fully assessed and methods and models of care have been examined.  I return to my point that in some model 4 hospitals we have a ratio of nine nurses to one health care assistant while in others it is only 2:8, so there is much work to be done.  We know that was done in Cork and in the UK before that.  It related to the fact that when they screened out orthopaedic referrals, physiotherapists could deal with 50% of patients themselves rather than sending them on to the orthopaedic surgeon.  There is much ongoing work to be done.  My greatest criticism of the HSE in the past was the fact that a national organisation failed to bring uniformity to the system.  One would find things being done very well in one hospital and it would not be transposed across the system to other hospitals.  The new hospital groups will certainly address that in a major way as there will only be six CEOs to deal with rather than 49.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher said we had been waiting for the roll-out of free GP care for two years, which is true.  We have already covered this, in that we said we would do it in respect of the long-term illness scheme and health technology assessment but, given the legal problems that caused and the complexity of the system one would be setting up just for a temporary phase, we made the decision to go in a different direction.  We will come back with some very distinct proposals to the Government in the next number of months.  I know Deputy Kelleher has waited two years, but the previous Government had 14 years and nothing happened.  He will forgive me for throwing that at him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000007#F00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1373447400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Could Ms McGuinness be very brief?

I do not accept that the drugs task forces are falling off the cliff.  What we are doing is reviewing their role and effectiveness.  As Deputy Byrne has made clear, many people have very serious concerns about their effectiveness and the way they are operating currently.  We need to ensure that, at a time of very limited resources, we are getting value for money and getting the best outcomes for those for whom we are trying to provide the service.<\/p><p>  Part of the complication has been the fact that alcohol is involved in the drugs task forces in terms of abuse of substances because, again, it is another drug.  A policy from the Department is being considered by Government at the moment, and that will go to the Select Sub-Committee on Health very shortly.<\/p><p>  We know there is a lot of angst among sporting organisations around the idea of sponsorship but, if the Chairman can afford me a minute to do it, I believe it is worth pointing out that the earlier people drink, the more likely they are to abuse it and to have a problem with it.  We need to protect young people from the advertising of alcohol in so far as we can.  Major sporting events are very often large family events.  Children enjoy sport and we want it to be an integral part of their growing up.  We would hope it would stay with them as a habit for life and we think that is a very positive thing to do for health.  However, we do not want it associated with exposure to alcohol advertising at an early age.  We can ask where the evidence is to support X, Y and Z, but all we have to do if we want evidence is to ask why drinks companies spend so much money advertising alcohol if it does not improve sales.  Advertising alcohol to young people will encourage them, as the curious beings they are, to try it out and start drinking at an earlier age.<\/p><p>  As I said, we know absolutely that there is evidence that the earlier a person starts drinking, the more likely they are to have problems.  We have seen the report from Dr. Stewart, who came back here from Liverpool and who was shocked at the number of young people in their 20s he was dealing with who had liver failure from cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis does not develop in a year but over a number of years of heavy drinking, so these people in their 20s had to have started drinking heavily in their teens.<\/p><p>  I believe very much that we have an obligation and a responsibility to protect our children, the next generation.  My view on advertising at sporting events is well known.  I am absolutely supportive of the Minister of State, Deputy White, in this regard.

As the then Minister, Deputy Martin, commenced a report in 2002 that culminated in the publication of the expert group report on introducing a no-fault vaccine compensation scheme.  It is an issue we have addressed at the committee on a number of occasions.  Up to now, subhead F2 was to deal with that and, sadly, it has not been dealt with.  I am disappointed by that.  If the Minister cannot brief us today, he might brief us as to what is the timeline for this.<\/p><p>  I note that the explanation for this Vote refers back to the previous expert group which was established in 1977 and which found in the early 1980s that 16 children had, in all probability, been profoundly brain-damaged by the administration of the three-in-one vaccine, in particular the whooping cough element of that.  Fifteen of those 16 sets of parents took a &pound;10,000 <i>ex gratia<\/i> payment at that time.  Can the Minister tell me that what we are talking about here is providing additional supports to those particular children, who are now adults?  We have to look in a fair-minded way at the offer that was put to those parents, many of whom were under severe financial pressure at that time.  Of course, one of those parents did not take the compensation.  Mrs. Margaret Best went on to win her High Court case against Glaxo Wellcome on behalf of her son, Kenneth Best, and got substantial compensation on foot of that.<\/p><p>  Are we now considering revisiting the once-off payment that was made by the then Minister, Dr. Michael Woods, to those 15 parents, or are we talking about some other overall scheme that has been promised for a long time but has not moved along?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000009#H01400","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Does the issue of narcolepsy as it relates to the vaccine form part of the new report on damage by vaccines?

There is no question or doubt that people have suffered as a consequence of the vaccine which was given and taken in good faith.<\/p><p>  That brings me to Deputy Denis Naughten's inquiry.  This subhead keeps the issue open for possible future use.  I have asked the Department to explore with the State Claims Agency the idea of addressing the issue of vaccination.  As the Deputy knows, I share his strong views.  Vaccines are given, taken and manufactured in good faith and problems arise in small numbers.  Where they do, people should be looked after.  It is not right or just that they should have to go to court and mortgage their homes to get services for their children.  The State should provide.  That is my personal opinion.  This must be done in a way that is cost effective from the State's point of view and be discussed at Government level generally.<\/p><p>  If we want to derive the maximum benefit from vaccination programmes, 95% of people must be vaccinated in order to protect us all.  One of the great achievements of medicine in the past 200 years was the eradication of smallpox through vaccination.  We rarely see a new case anymore, nor have I ever seen a case of tetanus in this country, although I saw one in Haiti while I was there.  We want people to feel safe and be responsible, not just for the protection of their children but also of their broader communities.  Where events occur that do not arise as a result of negligence, people should be looked after by the State.  The question of how to do this is being explored with the State Claims Agency.  I will revert with more details when I have them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000010#J00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Denis Naughten in briefly, as we are under pressure for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013071000010#J00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>There is a deviation in subhead F2.

Some 1.87 million people are covered by medical cards, 68,000 more than were covered last year.  The determining factor, in the first instance, for a medical card is a financial assessment.  In the event that people marginally exceed that assessment figure, they can either qualify for a general practitioner, GP, visit card or, where they have medical conditions, apply for a discretionary medical card.  A full review is being carried out of the discretionary medical card system to ensure medical doctors examine the assessments and clients and that it is not just a managerial or administrative function.  A doctor is heading up the review process and a medical doctor engages locally in each of the regions.  There are 59,000 discretionary medical cards and more than 19,200 discretionary GP visit cards.  These are significant numbers.<\/p><p>  A person is not automatically entitled to a discretionary medical card if he or she has cancer and is above the financial threshold.

It was at the CEO's discretion, not a doctor's discretion.  The cards were given out for all sorts of reasons.  In some regions, anybody who had cancer would get a card.  As we all know, in the past the word \"cancer\" struck terror into people's hearts and the prognosis was very poor, but cancer nowadays is a very different condition.  It ranges, sadly, from a desperate diagnosis to often being not such a bad diagnosis at all.  I set up the system, and requested that it be put in place, whereby discretionary medical cards were based on medical grounds.  A team of medical doctors, unrelated to the patient, assess the situation and decline or give a discretionary medical card on a medical basis.  When the HSE was formed the CEOs of health boards were no longer there so there was a question over who had the discretion.  Perhaps in south Tipperary the discretion might have been devolved to a doctor.

The Revised Estimate for 2013 allocates gross funding to my Department of over &euro;439.1 million which includes over &euro;413.346 million in current funding and &euro;25.76 million in capital funding.  When appropriations-in-aid receipts of just over &euro;5 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2013 is some &euro;408.3 million.  <\/p><p>  The free preschool year in early childhood care and education programme has been allocated &euro;175 million in 2013 and continues to be provided as a universal programme which is very important, giving all children equal access to free preschool education.  Based on the statistics available for birth rates, there has been no decline in the number of children in the eligible age range and recent increases in birth rates indicate that the number of places will increase.  The success of the programme can be seen in its high take-up rate.  In total, the early child care programmes implemented by my Department make up over &euro;260.5 million or almost 60% of its expenditure.  I have had the discussion here a number of times with the committee on the amount of programmes available.  Keeping these child care programmes at their current level costs the Department 60% of its expenditure.  <\/p><p>  The community child care subvention and child care education and training support schemes assist low-income parents with child care costs and came under significant funding pressures in 2012 owing to the increasing number of qualifying parents.  I am pleased that the Government has increased my Department&rsquo;s funding provision for child care by providing &euro;11.5 million in 2013 for a new school age child care scheme to support parents entering employment.  The scheme will commence in September.  Some 6,000 after school places will be available under the scheme when fully rolled out and the Department of Social Protection is responsible for determining eligibility.  The funding is expected to increase to &euro;14 million per annum when the scheme is fully rolled out.<\/p><p>  I am also pleased that the Government has increased my Department&rsquo;s funding provision by &euro;2.5 million to provide for the new area based response to child poverty programme.  The new programme will be implemented from 2013 until 2016 and build on the learning from the three projects operated in Tallaght west, Ballymun and Darndale.  We have a process under way to deal with the new applications that will be submitted.  The three existing sites will continue under the new programme and, I hope, will be joined by at least three new sites later this year.  As Deputies will be well aware, the programmes in place are evidence based and there is quite a piece of work to be done to ensure we learn from the three programmes on early intervention with children and families.  We want to ensure the lessons learned are applied in the new projects and also mainstreamed to other services.     <\/p><p>  I am pleased to announce that the new area based programme will be co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies.  My Department and I had approached it and asked it to continue to support the work being done.  We got agreement to a &euro;14 million investment in the area based poverty initiative in the past few weeks.  The Atlantic Philanthropies will co-fund this very important work in areas of poverty, where families are under pressure and where we need to intervene in the same way that we have done in the three pilot projects.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that work is ongoing to establish the new child and family agency in terms of both organisational reforms and the preparation of the necessary legislation.  Obviously the combination of HSE child welfare and protection services, family resource centres and the educational welfare services of the National Educational Welfare Board will provide a very effective starting point in ensuring supports for children and families are effective and streamlined.  Deputies will be aware that &euro;541 million has been allocated to the HSE Vote in 2013 in respect of children and family services.  In addition, my Department has a further allocation of over &euro;63.66 million in its Vote that will relate to the new agency.<\/p><p>  My Department received a significant increase of over &euro;19.4 million in its 2013 capital funding allocation to enable it to proceed with the Oberstown campus project that will redevelop and expand the children detention centre in Oberstown, County Dublin.  As Deputies will be aware, the commencement of the project has already enabled us to ensure boys in detention are now accommodated in Oberstown rather than St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and will allow me to end the practice of sending 17 year old boys to the institution from next year.  The Government has made other announcements on the matter such as the closure of St. Patrick's Institution and that people under 18 years will no longer be sent to St. Patrick's Institution.   <\/p><p>  In addition, I am pleased that my Department&rsquo;s capital funding of &euro;5 million for child care services, youth caf&eacute;s and other youth projects and the development of play and recreational facilities which is so important in giving children opportunities to develop and learn has been continued in 2013.  These grant funding schemes are of major benefit to children and young people, whether in preschool services or availing of youth facilities.<\/p><p>  With other Departments, my Department undertook a comprehensive review of expenditure in order to achieve the public expenditure savings required under the EU-IMF programme.  The Department was required to contribute &euro;41.384 million in savings in the period 2012 to 2014 and &euro;16.028 million of these savings were required in 2013, which represented a reduction of just under 4%.<\/p><p>  As part of the new performance accounting arrangements introduced in 2012, the subhead structure of Vote 40 is based on three new major programme areas: programme A - children and family support, programme B - sectoral programmes for children and young people, and programme C - policy and legislation.  I shall give a breakdown of the &euro;16 million savings required in 2013: &euro;4.27 million is from programme A; &euro;9.83 million is from programme B;  and some &euro;1.92 million is from programme C.<\/p><p>  The current funding allocation for my Department after reduction for the 2013 comprehensive review of expenditure savings would have been of the order of &euro;402 million.  Additional savings of some &euro;3.6 million would have arisen as a result of reduced staffing costs.  However, the additional funding of &euro;14 million provided for my Department in 2013 to support a new school age child care scheme and the area based response to child poverty programme has increased its gross current funding allocation to over &euro;413 million.  That is the correct figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000003#B00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Is it &euro;413 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000003#B00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Yes.  All Departments have seen significant reductions in their Voted allocations in the past five years.  As a result, there is increasingly little scope for Departments to deal with budget overruns, additional requirements or new initiatives.  Despite this, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to children and young people continues to be demonstrated through the new initiatives and additional funding given to my Department, as I outlined at the start of my presentation.<\/p><p>  We have also been proactive in trying to find resources from within my existing allocation, for example, to enable the first phase of the longitudinal study Growing Up in Ireland to be completed during this year and next.  Every European country conducts this type of longitudinal study and it is extremely important that we continue to get the range data that we obtain from the study.  Departmental funding will allow us a third sweep of the infant cohort at age five years in 2013.  Such a study is important because it will show us how five year olds have benefited, for example, from the ECCE scheme.  This major study will examine how five year olds have benefited from preschool and made the transition to primary school and also how they are doing in other important indices.<\/p><p>  All areas must find ways of meeting objectives with reduced funding.  I am satisfied that services for children and young people have been accorded a high priority relative to overall reductions in public expenditure.  However, it is incumbent on all of us to contribute to more cost effective delivery of public services.<\/p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, my Department is leading a comprehensive reform of services for children and young people which encompasses all of the reports that the sub-committee will have discussed and suggested.  It will bring together key services under the child and family agency.  It also extends to the review and reform of the youth schemes which still have an allocation of almost &euro;53.5 million and the school completion programme.  The purpose is to achieve the best possible outcome within the resources at our disposal.  I hope my statement is of assistance to the sub-committee and look forward to its input and discussion of the issues involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000003#B00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454600,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening remarks and I welcome the fact that the child and family agency establishment Bill will be published next week.

I will start on a positive note and welcome the announcement of co-funding of almost &euro;14 million from Atlantic Philanthropies.  I congratulate the Minister and her officials on that, which is very positive news, although I was not aware of it until I read the opening brief last night.  The Minister has embarked on a reform agenda since taking over the new Department in February 2011, and she knows that as an Opposition party we have been supportive of many of the measures embarked upon.  My concern relates to the slow pace at which some reforms are progressing.<\/p><p>  I will not rehash the matter, but last week I highlighted some of the areas in which the Minister has failed to meet targets set by herself.  Perhaps the Minister can comment more comprehensively on the promised and pending legislation?  This morning in the D&aacute;il we asked about the information and tracing Bill and I would also like to know about the Children First legislation and, as the Chairman mentioned, the new child and family support agency legislation.  Will the Minister give a more detailed and realistic timeframe for the enactment of these key pieces of legislation, which are all part of her reform agenda?<\/p><p>  I will go through the various subheads of the Vote.  There is a reduction of &euro;1.6 million for the Family Support Agency and, digging further into the matter, in 2013 there is to be a reconfiguration of services for children and families.  The word &quot;reconfiguration&quot; always worries me, as I find it is a new term for &quot;cutback&quot;.  This is an extremely important agency which does important work in supporting the vulnerable and more marginalised in our society.  Will the Minister outline where she hopes the reconfiguration will take place?<\/p><p>  I welcome the maintenance of &euro;170 million for the universal free preschool year.  Equal access is fine as long as the child does not have a disability or special needs, but if a child has particular requirements there is no real and true equal access, as it is down to the discretion of an individual preschool as to whether it can provide a service.  Recently we witnessed a reduction in funding from the HSE to support assistants in these schools, and this document does not indicate how the Department is picking up the slack.  Will the Minister refer to that point?<\/p><p>  Last week the Minister announced funding of &euro;2.75 million to improve child care facilities.  Ms Teresa Heaney, the chief operations officer with Early Childhood Ireland, stated that this was not new funding but rather a rehash of a previous announcement.  She has called for ring-fenced funding for training, mentoring and inspections.  I notice from the document that approval has been sought and received for new posts associated with the new child and family support agency.  We need those posts, and I do not dispute them, but nowhere in the document is there confirmation of the additional inspectors required on foot of the RTE expos&eacute; or of funding being put aside to ensure that each region without an inspector will get one, particularly in the case of children in child care facilities after September.<\/p><p>  We had a very lengthy committee meeting on foot of the RTE expos&eacute; and, at the time, the Minister spoke of having eight objectives to reassure and restore the confidence of parents, which had been shattered by the investigation.  She spoke about training, reform of inspections and tougher sanctions for breaches of regulations.  I am disappointed because I thought the Minister might have alluded to these in her opening address, as the matter is extremely important.  The Minister is probably aware that I produced a Bill to introduce tough sanctions for people who break regulations, so could I take the liberty of asking the Minister to comment on that today?<\/p><p>  Under the child care programme, the community child care subvention will undergo a large decrease in 2013 from 2012.  In light of the fact that increasing numbers of children are eligible for this scheme, does the Minister not believe the overall process must be reviewed?  Is the scheme sustainable in its current form, as it seems to be questionable?  I can speak about my own constituency in Westmeath and Longford.  A group that wishes to provide a community child care facility in Moate, which currently has no such facility, is ineligible for the scheme as it stands.  There is an inequity, as certain areas have no access to this scheme.  Funding was reduced in the previous year, so will the Minister comment on that?<\/p><p>  There seems to have been a substantial increase in miscellaneous legal fees, based on the 2012 figure.  Why has that happened?  Is it a result of the challenge to the children's referendum?  I hope the answer is that the increase has its basis in the raft of legislation that will come from the Department when we return in September, but I am afraid the former might be answer.<\/p><p>  In May, Judge Ann Ryan mentioned the lack of detention facilities.  I acknowledge the positives first, in the form of the capital allocation to build the facility at Oberstown.  I welcome that work, and Judge Ryan acknowledged that a long-term solution is in place.  For the shorter term, however, there is nothing in the figures to alleviate the problem.  There were 18 cases over three weeks in which authorities could not find a detention facility for children, and there was no option for repeat offenders except to let them out again, which is worrying.  I hope the Minister will be able to bring us up to speed in that regard.  There may have been a staffing issue, so the Minister might be able to address that.<\/p><p>  There is a major reduction in the area of youth organisations and services.  In May this year the National Economic and Social Council report entitled <i>The Social Dimensions of the Crisis: The Evidence and its Implications<\/i> indicated that young people are hardest hit by this crisis.  On top of high levels of youth unemployment and emigration from Ireland, we have the fourth highest percentage among the 28 European member states - 18.4% of young people aged 15 to 24 years - not in education, employment or training, despite significant increased demand.  Despite that, youth work services designed to support young people through the crisis have had their funding cut by 30% since 2008.  I accept that part of this happened in the tenure of the previous Government, but that reduction has been maintained and increased in the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000004#C00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373455200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1373455200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000005#D00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1373455200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McLellan and wish her the best of luck on her maiden voyage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000005#D00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1373455200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I would like to apologise on behalf of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, for whom I am deputising because he is tied up in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I welcome the Minister and her officials.  I am pleased that this committee has an opportunity to address these Revised Estimates.  Having read the Minister's opening statement, I acknowledge that there are many positives in it.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the appointment of a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the establishment of a new Department.  We had called for and advocated such a move for a long time.  My colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has worked diligently on children&rsquo;s issues.  It is fair to say that as an Opposition party we have been constructive and positive on these issues.  While the appointment of the Minister and the establishment of the Department came at the worst possible time economically, it could also be argued that in economically harsh times, greater protection and enhanced representation for children is needed more than ever.  In that context, the allocation of a budget of &euro;439 million to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 is modest, albeit an increase on 2012.<\/p><p>  As we continue to consider the implications of the Anglo Irish Bank tapes, we must contrast the pouring of tens of billions of euro in public money down that particular drain with the allocation of less than &euro;500 million this year to the Department responsible for the children of Ireland.  Some &euro;175 million has been allocated for the free preschool year and for early childhood care and education.  In this context, we must address the issues and concerns raised by a recent RTE documentary \"A Breach of Trust\", which concerns the failures of care in child care facilities in this State.  Quite simply, State funding for child care should be more closely tied to strict adherence to regulations.  This is essential if the free preschool year is to be extended to two years.  The airing of the documentary and the subsequent highlighting of these issues show that breaches of regulations in cr&egrave;ches are widespread, often with distressing consequences for young children.  The level of breaches of regulations - 75% - is very disturbing.  The high incidence of cr&egrave;ches with inadequate staff numbers and without proper records on staff is very serious.  The HSE has admitted that there is light-touch regulation and, damningly, that there is over-emphasis on the business interests of child care providers.  This is not surprising given that previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administrations opted for a model of child care based primarily on private, for-profit providers with minimal numbers of trained staff on low pay.  They took the same approach to the care of older people.<\/p><p>  The Minister needs to put in place a far more robust inspection regime, including more inspectors and more frequent inspections.  It is totally unacceptable that across large swathes of the country, there are no assigned inspectors or totally inadequate numbers of them.  It is clear that a review and reform of regulations with legislative change is necessary.  There needs to be a fundamental review of the policy of depending on the private, for-profit sector for the vast majority of child care.  The training and pay of child care staff needs to be upgraded.  It is a sad indictment of this society that carers are so undervalued.  I refer to family carers in the home and those who provide front-line care in cr&egrave;ches and nursing homes.  The system is geared to ensure private providers make a profit at the expense of low-paid workers.  Substandard care is a consequence of that.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been advocating comprehensive and well-funded child care provision for a long time.  In response, the Minister has spoken about new strategies, programmes and plans.  Such proposals are all very well, but they will be meaningless in the absence of funding commitments.  We are prepared to work in a cross-party manner to advance these issues.  The new child and family support agency will take a lead role, but it must be funded and equipped to do so.<\/p><p>  I would like to ask the Minister whether the allocation for the preschool year that has been provided for in these Revised Estimates will be linked to better regulation.  Will it be more closely tied to proper compliance?  What is the position regarding the proposed extension of the scheme to two years?  I welcome the announcement by the Minister in her opening statement that she hopes to publish the child and family agency (establishment) Bill 2013 next week.  This has been awaited for a long time.  We look forward to seeing the detail of the Bill and working to achieve the best possible outcome.  One of the smallest allocations in these Revised Estimates is the State contribution of &euro;2.5 million for area-based responses to child poverty.  I note the Minister's statement that the bulk of the funding for this programme - &euro;27 million - comes from Atlantic Philanthropies.  This covers just three disadvantaged areas in this State, with another three to be added next year.<\/p><p>  In this Revised Estimate, we are allocating &euro;2.5 million to a handful of areas to address child poverty, while in budget 2013 a full-year cut of &euro;142 million was made to child benefit, which is the most direct and beneficial payment to families and children in poverty or in danger of poverty.  I know the Minister's Department is not directly responsible for that particular cut, but she is part of the Government that imposed it.  That cut and all the other cuts that are affecting families and children are regrettably undermining the Department's positive work and its future plans.  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that allocations for the free preschool year should be linked to better compliance.

When that funding is reduced, one sees a decline in the services that can be provided.  Unfortunately, the knock-on effect of reduced intervention at an early age will see children going down the route we do not want to see them taking.  In the light of this the Minister might reconsider this proposal.  I understand budgets are tight and that we are in a very precarious financial position, but because the funding for these projects is being cut back and there is no intervention and supports within their communities there is an increase in the number of children coming before the courts from marginalised and vulnerable areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000009#H00600","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>This morning at a meeting of the Select Committee on Health and Children the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, referred to a review by his Department of the local and regional drugs task forces.

Many programmes and youth services have adjusted to their budgets.  Most have told me that the cutback has not affected their programme of work with young people.  I do not know what the figures are, but when I talk to people on the ground who are working in the services, they say they have a reduced budget and are using other initiatives to work with young people.  They are not leaving them short of services or hours.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned the local drugs task forces.  I am quite critical of the drugs services, particularly the national drugs task force model.  I have said locally and again at the meeting this morning that we need a new model.  I really believe the task forces are not doing what they should be doing.  When they were first set up, they worked with families and locally, but now they have become large empires and organisations and there is a huge difference between the work they did when they started in the 1970s and what they are doing now.  I told the Minister for Health this morning that I hoped with this new programme there would be a reconfiguration of these task forces because the people affected by them, particularly drug users or those on methadone, were not getting the service that they deserved.  I would like to see them back under the umbrella of the HSE or to see a programme put in place somewhere in the medical service, particularly through GPs who have a lot to give to a programme for people on methadone.  I hope this comes out in the study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000009#H00800","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>On youth funding, I have been chairing the meetings of the EU Council of Youth Ministers in the past six months.  It is very clear that, by international standards, our youth work sector is very well funded by comparison with those in some other countries.  There is no indication in the feedback we get from youth services that fewer young people are accessing services.  They have reformed and changed administrative and pay costs and the figures we have show the same number of young people accessing services, for example, no service has closed.  They have adjusted with some difficulty.  I am not saying it has been easy for the youth sector.  However, I am very impressed by the quality of the interventions made all over the country and the services the youth sector is providing.  We are very fortunate to have such a good youth sector.  If we were not borrowing &euro;1 billion a month, the Government, I am sure, would want to invest further in youth services.<\/p><p>  The successful negotiation of the youth guarantee of &euro;8 billion to be put up front in the EU budget in the next two years offers an opportunity for the youth sector if it can organise and make applications for funding.  Youth services can do much of the pre-employment work that needs to be done with young people in terms of confidence-building and developing skills, which is so important for employers.  One of my priority goals during the Irish Presidency was to make sure youth work was seen as making a contribution to youth employment.  The Government will work on initiatives and programmes to be delivered in the youth guarantee in the next few months.  It does provide an opportunity for the youth sector.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Catherine Byrne&rsquo;s point on the drugs task forces, I am aware that she has a lot of experience and interest in this area and I am sure the Minister for Health will take her points on board.  We do fund some services in that area also and will be working jointly with the Minister for Health on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000009#H00900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Are there comments or questions on subhead B7, early intervention programme for children, dormant account funding; subhead B8, childhood poverty initiative or subhead B9, early child care payment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22013071000009#H01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I presume that will work itself out in the next year.

When one sees the various subheads of the Vote one appreciates the expanse and variation in the area encompassed by the Department.  In his questions he put particular emphasis on the importance of broadband, the progress that will be made by the end of the year and the financial issues that will arise from that.  This relates in part to Deputy Harrington's question.  The outturn was so low for the past year that the increase of 132%, if one looks at it in terms of global figures, is not really that significant.  As Deputy Moynihan knows, the spend will be modest again this year.  This is because the policy formation process was a task force that I chaired between industry and the Department.  We had some expert advice available.  That report morphed into the national broadband plan.  The problem is that in the area that has been identified in which State intervention is unavoidable, one cannot make provision in the Estimate and spend it in 2013 because State investment is regarded as State aid.  While it is a significant part of the country geographically, the population is not nearly as significant, but people who live in less densely populated areas have as much right to high-quality broadband as anywhere else.  It has been acknowledged that the private sector, in which there is significant competition, is performing well in urban Ireland.  We have regular discussions with them on the roll-out of their investment plans, but when State intervention is necessary, we have no choice but to comply with European requirements on State aid and procurement.  For that reason, about six weeks ago - do not hold me to that date - we signed a contract with an Irish consultancy company to perform a detailed mapping exercise in conjunction with, among others, the providers themselves and the main telecommunications companies in the area.  It is necessary to conclude that exercise, including handling the procurement side and making the submission to Brussels.  There is a provision in the Estimates for this year but it is minor compared to what the demand will be in 2014 and 2015.  It is only the cost of the preparation of the plan, but in terms of expenditure, we have committed some &euro;350 million, of which the State will pay at least half.  The consultants may well have a different figure by the time they have finished their exercise.  To be truthful, there will be no spending on the main item in 2013, but it will be accelerated and ramped up in 2014 and 2015.  As Deputies know, the commitment in the plan is that by the end of the lifetime of the Government there will be no area of the country that does not at least have a broadband service of at least 30 Mbps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000003#B01500","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373445600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I presume that, in the context of the financial and human resources inputs, the numbers listed to the left on the relevant page indicate the number of personnel employed by the Department.

As the Chairman has noted, the figure pertaining to the licence fee sticks out.  In addition, the Minister might explain the position regarding the capital grant for TG4.  Many people have noted that while almost &euro;200 million goes into RTE from the public purse each year, it also has other revenue.  One can then consider stand-alone broadcasters, which can and are making it simply on the basis of their revenue.  One would question where all the money is going and the first point people highlight is the big money being paid to RTE's leading broadcasters.  Is there a factor pertaining to details such as the cost of programming that is available to the Minister?  I believe the amount of resources, number of researchers and so on it has on its programmes compared with the independent broadcasters are way out of line.  In addition, I note the figures on the home-made or indigenous programmes on RTE.  While some such programmes have been excellent over the years, there appears to be a tendency to move away from them.  I hope the Minister, in so far as he can, encourages RTE to go into the home market and make sure the great talent available is harvested for the national broadcaster on its own.  I will leave it at that.  My first question went over and back from communications and broadcasting and in addition, I raised the capital grants for TG4 and the home-produced programmes on RTE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D00400","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Under subhead B7, no figure is included in respect of grants for digital terrestrial television.

If one looks at the 2012 Estimate, it is the same Estimate.  However, the Chairman's point is that it is more than the outturn for 2012.  The reason for that is the outturn was somewhat less than the Estimate for reasons of evasion, non-collection, the recession or whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Perhaps people are getting rid of the televisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D00700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>It may be so.  In any event, the outturn of &euro;179 million fell short of what was the Estimate.  While the 2013 Estimates include a figure of &euro;185,724,000, as Zhou Enlai replied when asked about the impact of the French Revolution, it is too early to say yet where that figure will end up.  However the Chairman is correct, in that there is a significant evasion problem that could be of the order of &euro;30 million.  The Chairman also wished to ascertain what is the fee accruing to An Post for collection and in terms of the agency fee that is payable, it is &euro;12,457,000.  That is what the contract, which requires An Post to perform to certain standards and so on regarding the collection of the television licence fee, stipulates as to its particular allocation.<\/p><p>  The Chairman's critical question is whether the transition to the public service broadcasting charge will mean more revenue.  Truthfully, I believe the answer is that it will depend on the collection system.  Much of the strong argument that exists for the transition to a public service broadcasting charge would be undermined were the collection system not effective.  There are two principal arguments for the transfer, the first of which is technology.  It pertains to the fact that a great many people are accessing public content other than on traditional television sets and that in a society, it is fair that everyone should contribute for that public service content and that therefore, one is liable to pay the charge like everyone else.  The second argument concerns the scale of evasion and the need to do something about that.  Therefore, in answer to the Chairman's question, it appears as though one should be able to raise more revenue if 99% of people are paying and that without increasing the television licence fee, one should bring in more revenue.  However, that depends on whether the collection system will be effective.  Colleagues will have opinions about the efficacy of the existing collection system but the question is whether it can be improved upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D00800","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>If it were highly effective, could the charge be lower?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D00900","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1373446200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>The answer to that is \"Yes\" and \"No\".  Yes,  more money will be there but the Chairman already has heard from Deputy Moynihan that others are contending for a share of the revenue.  For example, the independent production sector makes an increasingly valuable contribution these days in respect of creativity, innovation and that kind of thing.  The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, that is, the regional radio stations, undoubtedly produce public service content.  They are, however, commercial enterprises and therefore a state aid question again arises, apart from any other consideration.  Theoretically, the honest answer to the Chairman's question is if one had a 99% effective universal collection of a new public service broadcaster charge, theoretically of course it could permit of some reduction.  However, it would be a public policy decision as to whether that would be wise.  There are policy objects imposed on public service broadcasters by law.  Everyone in this committee meeting will have an opinion as to how well they are discharged but in terms of Deputy Moynihan's question on whether it is a large amount of money compared with what he called stand-alone broadcasters, the answer is while it is a lot of money, the public service objectives imposed by law on the public service broadcasters are not imposed on what Deputy Moynihan described as stand-alone broadcasters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000005#D01000","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373446800,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Let me return to the definition of public service broadcasting.

The Act sets out broad principles.  Philosophically, we are talking about the obligation on public service broadcasters to reflect society back to itself in terms of current affairs, news reporting, quality productions, drama and culture, for example.  I refer also to the support of symphony orchestras.  Regional radio stations produce public service content, national and local news and information of public service merit and value for their listeners.  The argument is not that regional radio does not do public service work of merit, because it does, but that regional radio stations originated as commercial enterprises.  The licences were much sought after at the time.  Some would have problems that derive from having inherited debt, which is most unfortunate.  It is very important that if there is anything that the Government can do to ensure they continue to provide public service content, it should do it if it can within the constraints.  If the stations were to revert to playing wall-to-wall music, for example, it would not be public service content.  If, however, they produced a local documentary about matters of historical, cultural, public or political interest, it would constitute public service content.  A portion of the television licence goes to the sound and vision fund.  Local radio has access to that, but perhaps not as liberally as it should.

I think we are all reasonably familiar with the various grants to which one is entitled when one is putting in a new boiler, converting the attic or working on the outside walls.  There is no doubt that the scheme has been very successful.  There is a difference between the approach to private housing and that to what we call the warmer homes dimension.  If the owner of a private house applies for a grant for energy efficiency works and that application is approved, he or she is expected to put up some money also.  In the case of the warmer homes scheme, the State bears 100% of the cost of the work.  As the Deputy said, that scheme is aimed at homes at risk of fuel poverty.<\/p><p>  We are required to make a transition from the grants based system to what has been described as a pay-as-you-save model.  A substantial amount of work has been done in this regard by officials in the Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  They have had regard to similar developments in Britain and made adjustments to the model accordingly.  A fairly sophisticated model is ready to go well in advance of the 1 January deadline.  The real litmus test will be whether it will be attractive to householders.  I sincerely hope it will.  Last year there was a decline in applications for the traditional grants scheme.  There has been a similar experience in Britain.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, in particular, has done a great deal of work to analyse why that is the case and uncovered a number of factors.  Undoubtedly, the biggest is that consumers and householders are not spending money that they are not required to spend.  In some cases, they do not have the money to spend.  While that is the main factor, there are others.  There is some evidence to suggest people who are aware of the energy efficiency message and convinced of the merits of energy savings were attended to in the first belt.  We are looking at what we can do to sell the message better to householders who are not persuaded by the value of these efforts.  I hope we will be able to maintain the two schemes in parallel for a little while because of the inevitable time lag, but I am not in a position at this time to say that will happen.  It is right that the householder has time to select a contractor, put a contract in place, settle on all the messing that has to be done and so on.  Inevitably, there is a time lag between the making of application and execution.  We are looking at that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000007#F00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1373447400,"counter":697,"content":"<p>One of the big anomalies in the warmer homes grants scheme is that local authority housing which is being rented to tenants does not qualify.  The Department is stating it is up to the local authority to provide for improvements that may be needed, but there is not enough money in the system to facilitate this.  I accept that there has been a pilot scheme.  Some of the local authority stock that was built many years ago leaves a great deal to be desired when it comes to energy consumption.  Many people in that bracket have a huge difficulty and the warmer homes scheme should be extended to this sector.  Many people would benefit enormously if that issue was tackled, as would the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62013071000007#F00400","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1373447400,"counter":698,"content":"<p>That is correct.

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, was allocated &euro;50 million in the past few weeks to address the precise issue identified by the Deputy, which relates to local authority housing.  That should see a fairly quick result.  In that case, the relevant local authority can get on with the work straightaway.  The arrangement is between the authority and the Custom House.  As the Deputy suggested, a couple of pilot schemes - one in south Dublin and one in Longford - are in place and it will be interesting to see what they throw up.  We are moving towards an area based approach, whereby a cluster of houses in a certain area is refurbished with a view to seeing whether savings can be made and value for money achieved.  When one examines the issue of fuel poverty and affordability, one comes back to persuading people that the best contribution we can make is to make our domestic dwellings more efficient, given that we have to import our energy resources.  Separately, we have put in place the energy efficiency fund to concentrate on public and commercial buildings in which there is immense waste.
