I take it that we may have an opportunity to comment later in light of Peter's recent membership of the House.  He was a person with whom I and many Deputies got on well.  He brought a freshness and a vigour of intellectual thought to the House that were valued.  I was saddened to hear of his loss this morning.  I wish to extend our fullest sympathies to his family.  I hope that we will get an opportunity later to pay a longer tribute to him.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues of the day.<\/p><p>As predicted, we are rushing headlong into a major industrial dispute with the State bus company, Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The more than 110,000 regular passengers face chaos next Monday.  The staff of 2,600 face very worrying times.  They are concerned not only about their terms and conditions but the future of the company itself.  It seems to them that in one fell swoop an attempt is being made to dramatically and fundamentally alter the nature of the company and the terms and conditions of its workers who perform a very valuable community and social service, in addition to its commercial activities.  I put it to the Taoiseach some time ago as to whether the Government is committed to the maintenance of a State transport company, in particular one that provides a very significant service to regional and rural areas.  If it does, then a lot of policy implications stem from that.<\/p> <p> There have been warnings to the effect that the company is facing insolvency.  If it is, that very much comes into the political domain because the Government is the shareholder and the matter would have to come before the D&aacute;il in terms of any actions that would flow from a declaration of insolvency.  The stance of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is not acceptable.  He should have intervened much earlier.  For the entirety of 2015 plans were submitted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but were left on the shelf because a general election was due at some stage in the following 12 months.  In essence, that is the reason an intervention was not made, one that could have eased the situation somewhat, well in advance of the current crisis, but for political reasons the Government of the day decided not to act on plans that were submitted to it concerning the difficulties facing Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That inaction over a long period contributed to the current situation.  The idea that one can do everything in one fell swoop and, essentially, accelerate a race to the bottom with regard to terms and conditions is a bridge too far and is one of the reasons we are now heading towards a major industrial conflict, one that could spread to Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and other companies, which would create chaos in people's everyday lives in terms of getting to work and accessing services.  We all want to avoid that.<\/p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach time and again that at a minimum the Minister has a responsibility to set the mood music.  One gets the sense that he is silently, on the margins, acquiescing to the demise of a State company - a bus transport company - as his own ideological position is one that does not lend itself to the continuation of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I hope I am wrong.  At the very least the Minister should have engaged on the policy issues such as the application of the free travel scheme and the public service obligation routes and facilitated meetings between his Department, the National Transport Authority, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and unions to tease out the policy dimension to this issue.  There are policy dimensions to it.  It is not just simply an industrial relations issue that can be put into its box.  I put it to the Taoiseach that that type of initiative is now urgently required.  Will he discuss with the Minister the initiatives he can take to ensure a contribution is made by him and the Government to the resolution of this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800003#A00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488290700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I too welcome our visitors from across the water here today to the D&aacute;il.  I hope they enjoy their visit.  They may have issues to talk about in respect of Brexit and other matters.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that there will be an opportunity to pay tribute to our late colleague, Peter Mathews.  I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Susan and family.  He was always a different personality with a particular view in respect of financial circumstances as they applied to the country.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy in respect of his question on Bus &Eacute;ireann that no one wants a strike to happen.  It is a matter of grave concern to the Government and to commuters who travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann that a strike might happen.  I assure Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that the Government is committed to a State transport company.  A total of 81% of passengers who travel with Bus &Eacute;ireann use the PSO-subsidised service.  As he is aware, it is not possible to subsidise the commercial arm of the company, namely, the Expressway service in the context of Europe and where we are.<\/p><p>I do not agree with the Deputy or accept his comment that the Minister is on the margins silently acquiescing in the demise of a State company.  The Minister is but one member of a Cabinet that acts with collective responsibility here.  The Cabinet is fully committed to the retention of the State company.  In respect of the statements made yesterday by the board, company and trade unions, there is a willingness to engage in the kind of serious discussions that we all understand need to happen to solve this particularly difficult situation.  As I pointed out on several occasions, the WRC is ready, as ever, to assist.  <\/p> <p> There are some in the House who repeatedly claim that the Government and the Minister should do something.  When asked what the focus of that particular attention is, it is always about increasing subvention and assessing the free travel scheme.  I have already pointed that the subvention has increased to &euro;40 million and that there is no danger to the free travel scheme.  The PSO subvention increased by 11% this year and 13% last year and Bus &Eacute;ireann has benefitted from a 21% increase in its subvention in 2016.  The subvention applies to PSO services only and cannot under law be provided for commercial services.  If Expressway is losing &euro;50,000 per day, it is a matter that needs to be addressed.  The WRC stands ready to negotiate and discuss with the union and the board.  <\/p> <p> The Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Social Protection have already made it perfectly clear and have advised their officials to report back very quickly on the funding of the free travel scheme, to which there is no danger.  There is no amount of ministerial action that will resolve the issues internal to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  These issues can only be resolved through direct and realistic negotiations between employer and employees.  In respect of rural Ireland, it has already been made perfectly clear that any changes to the Expressway services will be taken up by the National Transport Authority, which will step in and assist in cases where connectivity is threatened.  Some Deputies alleged last week that this was an attack on rural Ireland.  The public bus service in rural Ireland is expanding through increasing the amount of PSO funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann and providing a 24% increase in funding for the rural transport scheme.  I hope everybody will assess this seriously and take the WRC-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488291000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I know it is important issue but we are constrained by time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800005#C00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488291000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Grant Thornton report was submitted to the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, and others in January 2016 and the Government sat on it.

It went on for a full year and a bit and then in one fell swoop, the Government has stated the workers will take the brunt for the entirety of the issues facing Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is what is happening here.  When the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, announced his Estimates for Bus &Eacute;ireann, he never once alerted anybody to the crisis facing Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Read the press release he issued on the day.  It is full of self praise - \"I'm doing this, I'm doing that.\"  Did he once alert anybody that there was a crisis coming down the tracks that his predecessor and the Government knew about?  In essence, regardless of whether it likes it or is transparent about it or will tell the truth, the Government is presiding over the demise of Bus &Eacute;ireann as a public transport company.  Many within Fine Gael probably agree with that, which is probably at the root of the inertia on the Government side.  It is acquiescence in the undermining of the company and the reduction in workers' terms and conditions in one fell swoop to levels that are not fair or acceptable.  I find it extraordinary that the Independent Alliance is presiding over and standing by that and is not insisting on a proper policy perspective on this issue.

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this morning the HSE published two reports into failures at a foster home in Waterford over the course of almost three decades.  During that time the foster home in question housed 47 children, one of whom we know as Grace, a young woman with profound intellectual disabilities.  She was left in that home for nearly 20 years despite a litany of sexual abuse allegations and neglect.  Grace was forgotten, abandoned by those in the health service charged with ensuring her care.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the reports published today are shocking.  For long periods of time, there was no intervention or interactions with Grace and the various persons who were directly involved in her case failed to discharge their duty of care to her.  Both reports published today stress the cases of four other service users relating to allegations of sexual molestation and physical abuse and an allegation from one man that he was locked in a cupboard.  All the while, serious breaches of all reasonable practices took place and nothing was done.<\/p>  <p>  These details were brought to the Taoiseach's attention at Cabinet this morning and he will be well aware of them.  No doubt he, like everybody else, is deeply shocked by the contents of the two reports.<\/p>  <p>  A commission of investigation has been long promised by Government and I welcome that it is to be set up in the coming weeks.  However, what we need here is accountability.  Reports and commissions are necessary and fine, but there are clear-cut instances of abuse of the gravest kind here, both in the treatment of Grace and others in foster care and of the failure of health officials to ensure her care and safety.  Who is responsible?<\/p>  <p>  We also have what is alleged to have been a cover-up.  Last year's Dignam report stated of the two reports published this morning that there were shortcomings in them and that there was an allegation that crucial files may have been deliberately destroyed by persons unknown.  That is a disturbing and damning allegation.<\/p>  <p>  The five-year delay in the publication of these reports is, we are advised, as a result of Garda concerns that they may impact on criminal investigations.  Can the Taoiseach tell us today where are those criminal investigations at?  Have arrests been made?  Do they concern the abuse, the cover-up or both?  Who in either the HSE or any other State agency has been held responsible?  It is not enough for us to produce shocking reports.  God knows, we have had enough of them.  We need to know who is accountable and that he or she is, in fact, held accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800006#D00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1488291300,"counter":25,"content":"<p>First, the least this House can do is apologise to Grace and her family.  Her treatment is a disgrace to us, as a country.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, requested the HSE to publish the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports following his receipt of the Dignam report in early November last and following discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE has been able to publish the redacted reports today, 28 February.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to the establishment of the commission, which we agreed to set up on 2 February 2016.  Following the disclosure and the serious of the matter, the Government agreed to set up that commission of investigation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will bring those terms of reference to Cabinet next Tuesday.  The HSE apologised today to anyone who experienced serious failings in the care received and for the significant failures of the former South Eastern Health Board.<\/p> <p> The Oireachtas has passed a number of items of legislation dealing with issues about this area including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children or Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, which makes it an offence to withhold information on serious offences committed against a child or a vulnerable adult; the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012; the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which includes stronger sanctions aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation, child abuse material and online grooming, was passed by the House at Christmas and signed into law by the President last week; and the Children First Act 2015, which placed key elements of the Children First national guidelines on a statutory basis, has been enacted.  When fully commenced at the end of this year, the latter Act will provide for a number of key child protection measures.  The Government also established the Child and Family Agency and children have been recognised as individuals in their own right under the Constitution for the first time.<\/p> <p> The policy in respect of intellectual disability, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, launched in December 2014 provides one overarching policy to which all social care services, including those provided directly or indirectly by the HSE, have subscribed and implemented in their places of work.  This has ensured that there is now a consistent approach to protecting vulnerable people - it is a no-tolerance approach to any form of abuse or neglect - and a culture which supports this ethos.<\/p> <p> The national guidance on host families in community settings recommendations were made in 2011 and updated in 2012.  Ms Leigh Gath is the confidential recipient who will examine concerns and offer help and advice to vulnerable adults or anyone concerned about a vulnerable adult in a HSE service or a service funded by the HSE.  The HSE is also establishing a national implementation review panel.<\/p> <p> Deputy McDonald asked if arrests have been made in respect of any criminal activities. That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to report on.  I do not have information in respect of arrests following criminal activity or any case that was being pursued.<\/p> <p> The two reports speak for themselves, and they are shocking.  As the Deputy is aware, when Mr. Dignam reported back in September 2016, there were a number of legal procedural issues to be dealt with.  The Minister updated the Government.

The question for people who woke this morning to read again about Grace and the 20 year ordeal she faced and that was faced by other vulnerable children in the care of the State is who is accountable.  The worry for many people is that we enter into another process of a commission that comes out at the far end with zero in terms of accountability.

There are serious governance malfunctions and, in many areas, an absence of good governance in the health service in general.  The OECD has found that Ireland has one of the highest spends on health services, yet it has some of the worst outcomes when it comes to accident and emergency treatment times, delayed admissions - with patients left waiting on trolleys - waiting lists for consultations and waiting lists for planned elective admissions.  The latter was starkly illustrated two weeks ago by the delay identified in scoliosis surgery for children.  Many other patients suffer in silence.<\/p>  <p>  There is lack of clarity in the governance structures between the Minister, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The HSE board has been abolished but the HSE continues to operate, seemingly at arm's length from and independent of the Department.  There is no certainty in the HSE and its future existence is unclear.  The HSE was set up to centralise decision-making and to have consistency in the delivery of services throughout the country.  This has failed because our services are as fragmented as ever.  Many HSE officials work in an interim or acting capacity and are unclear about their roles and functions.  This leads to a lack of trust and undermines any governance consistency.  It leads to a lack of trust by patients and by front-line staff.<\/p>  <p>  Hospital groups have been created but most do not have fully functioning boards.  It is unclear whether they will become trusts.  Community health organisations do not coincide with hospital groups in geographic settings, thus blurring areas of responsibility.  The interaction of individual hospitals within groups is poorly defined and model 2 hospitals can be starved of funds and resources while services in larger hospitals are given priority.  Hospital services and primary care services seem to work from different budgets and there is no integration.  This poor governance leads to substantial inefficiencies in the system and accounts for poor value for money, as identified by the OECD, and leads to much poorer outcomes for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Poor governance decision-making costs money but there is no transparency or accountability in the governance structures of the HSE to account for inefficient spending.  Cost-benefit assessment applies to the provision of drugs such as Orkambi and Respreeza, but no such cost-benefit analysis applies to governance decisions.  If we demand clinical excellence, we should also demand governance excellence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800008#F00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800008#F00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1488292200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>We cannot expect this to be provided on a voluntary basis and it must be underpinned by legislation to ensure that good governance is rewarded and bad governance is eliminated.

In some cases, the response is not what we might expect in terms of the excellence in governance and other areas to which the Deputy referred.  The work that he spoke of is part of an ongoing process.<\/p><p>This morning the Cabinet approved legislation dealing with a reduction in prescription charges for those over 70, and we approved the inclusion in that Bill of 10,000 medical cards for children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  There are reports showing a dramatic reduction in cancer rates among children compared to a few years ago.  If we were to start with a greenfield situation we might organise the structure of health services around the country in a very different way but many hospital facilities are now state-of-the-art.  A major infrastructure programme is to be carried out in the future and we are building a range of primary health care facilities around the country, which are expected to operate on a full-time basis so that people do not have to go to hospital in the first place.<\/p> <p> Nobody could disagree with the Deputy's principle of clinical excellence matched by excellence of governance.  There has to be an administrative capacity to back up clinical excellence and there is always a demand for this capacity but for many years this country has been behind in its digitisation capacity, whereby we could save time, create efficiencies and make people aware of the scale of what we do.  Those at the front line provide a service beyond criticism and those who have moved through centres of excellence will point that out.  With an ageing population there are always difficulties and that is what an effective, high-standard health care system is about.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and his Ministers of State are working diligently on this so that we can have a healthy, active and understanding Ireland and can have medical facilities and services as close to people as possible.  It is not perfect, by any means, but it is the source of the allocation of &euro;14.5 billion in 2017, an extraordinary amount of money for a small country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800008#F00600","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488292500,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The legislation to which the Taoiseach referred underpins decisions made by the D&aacute;il.

At 8 a.m. today the HSE TrolleyGAR system indicated that nationally 355 patients were waiting on trolleys in acute hospitals, which admittedly is too many, but it is down from 411 last week and 463 on this day last year.  There is no doubt that the number is too high and the HSE's special delivery unit continues to work with all hospitals to identify what can be made to improve patient flow.  Emergency departments under pressure this morning included University Hospital Galway and Cork University Hospital, which have both been identified as particular priority sites under the Department's winter initiative.  Each site has a specific plan in place and is undertaking mitigating actions that can improve the situation.  The Minister visited Galway last week.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone in the country has this vision of prefabricated buildings as being what were supplied in schools 40 years ago and which rotted after a particular time.  The Minister for Health visited Mayo General Hospital and saw the structure of the existing emergency department.  In consultation with the staff, a modular building in close proximity to the existing emergency department presents the opportunity to relieve all the pressure and stress experienced and the staff will be very happy with that.  The terms \"prefabricated building\" and \"modular building\" hark back to a time when prefabricated houses were provided throughout the country and prefabricated buildings were in schools.

As a result of that motion, an all-party delegation travelled to Egypt and met a number of influential people, including the Egyptian President, and came back with some degree of hope that the case would be resolved.  Unfortunately, that has not proven to be the case.  Ibrahim's trial has now been adjourned 19 times and last week we saw a statement from his family indicating that he is now on hunger strike and has been moved to the prison hospital.  Like others, I gave a commitment to continue to press this case and I think that is the view of all Members in the House.  Will the Taoiseach raise this issue directly with the Egyptian President?  It has gone on far too long and Ibrahim's health is suffering.  He is an Irish citizen who has been detained in an Egyptian prison since he was 17 years of age.

I would like to see what has come of it.  It is important to hear the views of everybody but what action are we taking on foot of it?  I have addressed both dialogues and put forward a number of simple measures we could seek from Europe to mitigate the impact in advance on our business, in particular.  Among them is allowing expenditure under the European Globalisation Fund to support upskilling and reskilling in areas we know are under pressure.  The Taoiseach said that the Government will request EU backing for measures to support business along with particular EU financial measures.  Another issue will be the utilisation of structural and cohesion funding, which we have not received up to now but which should be specifically targeted at areas that will be impacted by the UK's withdrawal.  The Taoiseach met the Vice-President of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, when he was here.  His message to me was very simple, namely, that Ireland should have specific \"asks\" that should be made early.  What specific asks has the Government made of the European Commission to this point to mitigate the impact we know is happening now or will happen imminently to industry and employment as a result of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800019#R00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1488297000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>What we have tried to do here is to take all the issues that were raised and put them in the different sectors to which they apply.  There were some very interesting observations made at the two all-island fora.  I thank Deputy Howlin for his attendance and contribution.  It is important to note that based on a pretty detailed analysis of the impact of Brexit to date on SMEs, on which we had a presentation yesterday, 49% of participants said it had no impact on their business, 13% said that it had a significant impact, 24% said it had some impact and 15% said it had a minimal impact.  However, the analysis of what would happen in 18 months time revealed that 17% said it would have a significant impact, 26% said it would have no impact, 13% said it would have a minimal impact and 44% said it would have some impact.  In respect of the package of measures being put together by Government, including access to lower interest and longer term funding, it is not a case of having a quantity of money to give to firms.  What is needed is a package of measures that will deal with the various sectors, the nature of the industry and the issue that will arise in terms of what they are exporting and selling.  Clearly, none of us yet knows what the British Government will say in its letter of intent to leave.  It concerns the issue about trade and potential tariffs because therein lies the analysis that Ireland must carry out and the options we must take.  We have done a vast amount of work.  The Deputy received his own briefing recently.  We are still unclear as to the nature of the relationship the UK will have with the EU.  We understand the Government wants to be as close as possible to the existing relationship but if one drops the Single Market and has a different association with the customs union, one is in a very different position.  We need clarity on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800019#R00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488297000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>One of the strongest messages participants in the dialogue conveyed is that there is an enormous amount of concern, fear and anxiety and that there have been many questions but not too many answers to those questions.  The Taoiseach is aware that the statement from London yesterday that restrictions will be applied to all arriving in Great Britain after a certain date next month shows that the British are much further advanced in detailing new barriers than they are in proposing ways of limiting their impact.  It appears that assurances concerning the common travel area are secondary to the eurosceptic-driven agenda to limit EU immigration.  Have we requested any clarification from the British about how this new policy will impact on the common travel area commitment?  Is it now the case that we must negotiate an exemption from a restriction rather than having the restriction based on accepting the common travel area?<\/p>  <p>  Another consistent problem, which was raised in the dialogue, is that the lack of some sort of special economic zone or free trade zone status for Northern Ireland and at least a number of Border counties will cause a dramatic disruption to supply chains and supply lines North and South.  This is distinct from the much broader concept of special status for Northern Ireland, which the British Government has not supported.  It has refused to seek it for Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Has the Taoiseach raised the issue of a special economic zone with the negotiating team in Brussels?  I agree with Deputy Howlin that there is a sense of a lack of what our agenda is and what our statement of objectives are.  We have the broad principles but what about the specifics?<\/p>  <p>  What was clear from the Northern Ireland panel, particularly those representing civil dialogue in Northern Ireland, was the complete absence of a coherent voice from Northern Ireland at the table.  The recent calling of an election and the collapsing of the institutions starkly illustrated the void in terms of someone speaking up with a coherent voice on behalf of Northern Ireland in the ensuing discussions that are to take place.  That was very evident coming out of the dialogue last Friday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800019#R00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1488297000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a valid question.  What is the result we want for our citizens?  What we want is the best result for our citizens in terms of our economy, their jobs, their prospects in terms of the common travel area, the peace process and our place in Europe.  It is the central issue.  When unemployment is down to 6.6% today, which is the best in nine years and quite astonishing in a two-year period, we want to be able to maintain that and keep it moving in the right direction.  I have put forward the proposition to the President of the European Commission, who I met last week, and the Belgian Prime Minister.  This week, I hope to meet Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, and Michel Barnier in respect of his task force.  There was a meeting with Italian officials yesterday.  We put forward the proposition that until we know what it is that the British Government is looking for in terms of its trading situation, we are not having a return to the Border of the past.  I listened to Lord Hain putting down amendments to the Bill in the House of Lords yesterday.  He said that a return to that kind of Border would have serious consequences North and South.  The British and Irish Governments are both agreed on that.  The Deputy rightly highlights restrictions on other European nationals coming to Great Britain after a certain date.  That is where the advantage lies with Ireland in terms of the Single Market and the opportunity to have that churn of talent coming here.  Europe has made it perfectly clear that there will be no cherry-picking of issues that arise here.  Europe has not been in a position to respond yet until the trigger is pulled in respect of Article 50.  This is a letter from the British Government stating that it is now withdrawing and setting out its position.  We have all our options covered here.

We will not return to that kind of Border.  I have made that perfectly clear to the British Government.  We are not having those customs posts along the Border at different locations.  There is no direction from Government for officials to go looking at sites for the possibility that one will have need of large car parks or sites for lorries etc.  We are not going back there because it brings with it sectarian violence, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will know only too well.  This is not a technological issue.  It is a political issue.  This has arisen because of the vote of people of the United Kingdom, even though Northern Ireland voted to stay.

I put to the taskforce already that one might be able to have an all-island solution in a number of areas such as animal health, including foot and mouth disease and BSE, water and energy, but these are issues on which nobody can yet answer the question of what is it that we will have until such time as we have clarity from the UK as to the trading relationship that it will have.

The level of interest being expressed from Great Britain in Ireland, among other countries that are competing for business, is strong.  We have connectivity here which is the second busiest route in the world.  Ours is an English-speaking, common law system.

I do not speak for the independent Policing Authority, nor should I, but I note the comment of the chairperson that she had absolute confidence in the Commissioner's ability to do the job in so far as the Garda is concerned.  She did express some concern about keeping the accelerator to the floor at the same time as being able to deal with the issues before the tribunal.  The Commissioner will respond to that and I have absolute confidence in her to be able to do that.  This tribunal is now up and running.

Would the Taoiseach not agree that that runs parallel to the work currently being done by an independent body headed by an international expert, namely, the Garda Inspectorate?  It has a very fine body of work, with two reports already published.  What we do not want is a series of parallel reviews.  The Garda is under enough stress.  The Garda Inspectorate has done a sterling job.

I explained Ireland's particular concerns arising from Brexit for our trade and economy; Northern Ireland and the peace process; the common travel area; and Border and citizenship issues.  The Belgian economy, like Ireland&rsquo;s, will be seriously affected by the UK's exit.  We agreed on the need for the EU to retain a united, values-based approach in the period ahead, and to deliver effectively for our citizens.<\/p><p>  At the Enterprise Ireland event, I met key representatives of Irish and Belgian businesses.  I delivered a positive message of support for their activities and for Ireland&rsquo;s role as a committed member of the European Union and a leading promoter of free trade.<\/p><p>  My discussions with President Junker focused on Brexit and the future direction of the EU.  I set out in detail our particular concerns and outlined our approach, and we exchanged views on the negotiations ahead.  Michel Barnier, head of the Commission's task force, joined us for part of our meeting.  I was very clear the unique circumstances relating to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement must be recognised from the start and reflected in the final agreement.  I am satisfied the Commission, which has been very open to hearing our views, has understood this message very clearly.<\/p><p>  Deputies will recall I met Michel Barnier in Dublin last year.  There has also been ongoing engagement with Michel Barnier's task force at official level, involving officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, other relevant Departments and, of course, our permanent representation in Brussels.  This engagement has aimed at setting out the details of Ireland's concerns about Brexit, including Northern Ireland and the other issues I mentioned.<\/p><p>I plan to travel to Brussels again on Thursday for a further series of meetings.  As part of this visit I will have further more detailed discussions with Mr. Barnier.<\/p><p>Since the UK referendum last June, I have had a series of bilateral meetings with my counterparts in EU member states and with the heads of the EU institutions.  I have also attended all meetings of the European Council, formal and informal.  At the recent informal summit in Malta, as at all meetings of the European Council, I engaged with my European counterparts, including President Juncker and Prime Ministers Michel and Gentiloni, during the course of the event and in the margins of the meetings.  We agreed on the need for unity and on the importance of our core values, which are central to our future peace and prosperity.  We also agreed on the importance of delivery for our citizens and, in that context, the need to press ahead in areas of particular relevance, including jobs and growth and investment as well as migration and security.  The exchanges at Valletta will feed into preparations for a meeting in Rome on 25 March to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, at which it is expected that the EU will set out plans for its future direction.<\/p><p>I have stressed the EU must remain united if we are to effectively confront the many challenges we face.  While there may be a difference of emphasis, this view is shared by other leaders, and I expect this will reflected in our discussions in Rome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800022#U02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488298800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I want to ensure the three Deputies get in on this.

The report states he said the Commission would undermine agreed OECD anti-evasion rules and was failing to keep to previous agreements respecting tax sovereignty.  Did the Taoiseach raise these matters with President Juncker or are the comments intended to make us appear tough without there being any follow-up?  In other words, was it a co-ordinated approach between the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, with the Commission in terms of its strategy on tax sovereignty and tax issues in general?<\/p>  <p>  The repeated assurances of Mr. Barnier concerning Ireland are very welcome, particularly in Northern Ireland, but, as we have said earlier, we need to go from generalities to specifics.  Some items clearly require the British to present their position first and I acknowledge this, but others are purely between Ireland and the European Union.  Whatever is agreed, there will be a need to support communities and businesses hit by Brexit.  I heard the Taoiseach state earlier it is not a question of giving support to companies, but there is no scenario where all negative impacts can be avoided.  There will be negative impacts and in some cases we are already being hit.  Has the Taoiseach raised the need for special funds, perhaps a relaxation of certain state aid rules, to help companies diversify markets and products during a transitionary phase?  If Britain is not in the customs union it will be trouble for domestic companies, particularly in the agrifood sector.

The Taoiseach spoke to me briefly about this previously, and he feels it is part of the normal chat down the decades in the EU, but it is not.  It is members of a core group stating they will do it their way.  We also have the members of the Visegrad group of eastern European states saying if this happens they will do it their way.  Whatever will happen, we all know that in the years to come the EU will not be the same EU as it is today.  The Taoiseach's EU strategy is an enigma wrapped in a mystery because we cannot get any details from him.  He has bits of chat about various sectors but we lack a sense of strategy.  The sense of strategy the Taoiseach must outline, because we are a democracy, is what are his proposals on Ireland and the forthcoming Brexit.<\/p><p>We are still in the dark and while we have had a lot of conversations with the Taoiseach we have had almost no clarity on strategy.

The British Prime Minister will trigger Article 50 within the next fortnight and I welcome the Taoiseach's declared objective that there must be a clause in any Brexit deal to allow the North to rejoin the European Union in the context of a united Ireland.  However, the Irish Government's rejection of a special designated status for the North within the EU is deeply disappointing and is at odds with his own stated position in this Chamber.  Last week, when asked about this by Teachta Adams, the Taoiseach said we had special circumstances, a special arrangement, a special peace process, special peace funds and special INTERREG funds, about some of which we spoke earlier.  He stressed the importance of all-island solutions to water, electricity and animal health so does it not make sense to have a special designated status for the North within the EU?  In my opinion, and that of many others, we need a special status for the Six Counties within the European Union, not outside of it.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach raise the case for a special designated status with Mr. Juncker and his chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier?

We abolished the stateless concept and the double Irish and this is why the Minister made his comment about the common consolidated corporate tax base.  We are holding onto our corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  I did not raise this with the President, Mr. Juncker, the other day because we were focused on the commencement of negotiations and how to maintain our priorities.

Continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard Border and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives.  The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard Border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard Border.

Given that the EU is already trading with third-party countries that are outside the customs union, there must be a precedent as to how this might work in practice.  Whether we like it or not, the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland is likely to become the border between the EU and a third-party country that will be outside the customs union.

I particularly referenced Dublin Port because many of the goods come in through there.  I noted that with advances in technology, all the necessary documentary clearance is done electronically.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the traffic-light system.  Some 92% of imported goods from third countries are now cleared electronically before they come to the port of import in Ireland.  They pass through without further examination.  <\/p>  <p>  A further 6% of imported goods are in the orange category.

While significant progress has been made, the Central Bank advises that due to the scale and complexity of the review, it will take some further time to complete.<\/p> <p> Specific timelines have been set for all lenders to complete their internal reviews, and some lenders will have their internal reviews completed sooner than others depending on the size of their mortgage books and the complexities associated with them completing the examination.  Based on current progress, the Central Bank expects that all relevant lenders will have identified affected customers by mid year and that they will progressively implement measures to address their situations with payment of redress and compensation.  The processing and consideration of any customer appeals and the Central Bank's own assurance work is a process that may continue beyond that point for some lenders.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank has set down a robust framework whereby lenders' internal reviews will be overseen by independent third parties.  As part of the examination, the Central Bank has made clear what it expects of lenders in terms of redress and compensation to impacted customers, namely, lenders will ensure that harm is stopped at the earliest possible time once a group of impacted customers is identified, interest rates applied to impacted customers' accounts are to revert to the appropriate tracker interest rate or impacted customers are to be given the opportunity to revert to such a rate where relevant, redress should ensure that impacted customers are returned to the position they would have been in had lenders' failure not occurred, compensation that reflects the detriment suffered by the individual customer is to be provided by lenders and an additional payment is to be provided to the impacted customers to enable them to take independent professional advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them.<\/p> <p> The framework of the examination has been designed to ensure that as and when groups of impacted customers are identified, in the first instance, the lender must stop charging the incorrect rate of interest on the customer's account to prevent any further detriment.  The framework also requires lenders to establish an independent appeals process to deal with customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress package that they receive from lenders in respect of these matters.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank has also advised that it will consider appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action, where necessary.  All angles, including individual culpability, will be thoroughly investigated in the context of the legal framework.  Enforcement measures will be deployed as appropriate, including investigating issues and taking cases under the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedure together with the use of fitness and probity powers.  Enforcement investigations of this type are detailed and forensic, routinely involving the scrutiny of thousands of documents and the conduct of interviews as part of the investigative process.  To date the bank has concluded an enforcement investigation in respect of tracker mortgage failures identified at Springboard Mortgages Limited and imposed a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank is also aware of the motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 26 January 2017 and it is noted that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach will invite the Bank to attend before it on a quarterly basis regarding the examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800024#W04100","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488300600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

There was a deadline to complete the assessment of their customers, to identify the accounts and so on, but there is no deadline on the reinstatement of the correct rate for customers.  Even where customers are being reinstated we now have the new phenomenon of tracker rates of 3.67% in the case of AIB and 3.25% in the case of Permanent TSB, which is a farce.  It is still going on.  That is the problem.  It will continue to be raised here until we can get answers to some very basic questions, which are not being answered by parliamentary question or whatever other means.

We need to ask ourselves, as a country, is it expected that the Central Bank would have enough resources, enough power and enough personnel to make sure that this issue would not arise?  The assumption out there is that there is a consumer protection role.  The Central Bank investigated this in 2011.  It found one bank which had to restore more than 2,000 individual to tracker rates, yet five or six years later we have another 13,000 individuals.

Not a single bank put up its hands, said it had found a problem and that it would address it.

If the Central Bank is to carry out a proper probe, that is the level of detail into which it needs to go because the investigation has to be a watershed moment for the Central Bank and our banking system.

Once a customer who has been affected has been identified in the first instance, the lender must stop charging the incorrect rate of interest on the customer's account and then communicate this to the customer to ensure that any further customer detriment is stopped as early as possible.  Once a full review of the customer's account is complete, and following external independent third-party assurance, the lender will then issue a letter to the customer explaining the nature of the error, the correct rate to apply to the customer's account and information on the next steps in the examination, including the redress and compensation process. <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy McGrath's last point, the Central Bank has also advised that it will consider appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action, where necessary.

The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer-term lending, including mortgages, as part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in its analyses credit unions need to consider the impact of longer-term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure as the issue of funding longer-term lending with short-term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House:<\/i><\/p><p>The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidence based business case.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800026#Y00600","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has no interest in assisting credit unions in getting into the mortgage market in any significant way.

That is the reality.  A small number of credit unions have had an increase of 15% in the limit regarding their loan book over a ten year period.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that for credit unions to get into the mortgage business in a significant way requires investment in underwriting and expertise.

However, despite all that, we hear back that, no matter what happens, banks are still reluctant to engage.  In the particular case to which I referred, the family went through the full year of the mortgage arrears resolution process and paid everything that was required.  Not only that, when the parents got a small increase in their income, they increased their payment.  Nonetheless, and this is not atypical, the day the MARP period finished, during which, notwithstanding the difficulties they were in, they had agreed to everything and done everything that was required, the bank issued them with a notification stating that it would seek to repossess the house.

In recent years, customers have been thrown to the wolves while vulture funds have been reaping major tax benefits from the purchase of loan books. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800028#AA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1488302400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, non-performing loans remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM.  In Ireland, significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of non-performing loans since the financial crisis.  Despite this progress, the level of such loans in the banking sector remains well above the European average.  Hence, the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.  This challenge will have to be met irrespective of whether the State has a shareholding in the bank concerned.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, the relationship between the Minister for Finance and banks in which the State is a shareholder is governed by relationship frameworks, which can be found on my Department's website.  In accordance with these relationship frameworks,\u00a0the Minister for Finance\u00a0has no direct function in commercial decisions made by the banks and these\u00a0decisions are the responsibility of\u00a0the\u00a0board and management of the relevant institution.  Notwithstanding the State's shareholdings in the banks, I must ensure the banks are run on a commercial, cost-effective and independent basis to protect their value as an asset to the State.<\/p><p>Similarly, I do not have a role in the National Asset Management Agency's commercial decisions. Under the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the agency has a well-established mandate to achieve the best possible return to the State by protecting, enhancing where possible, and ultimately realising the value of assets it has acquired.  To achieve the maximum return to the taxpayer, NAMA was established as an independent commercial body under the direction of an independent board.  I highlight for the Deputy that NAMA is operating within its mandate and progressing its objectives. <\/p><p>I should also highlight that there are substantial protections in place for customers in the event that a loan is sold\u00a0to a third party.  The Consumer Protection\u00a0Act 2015\u00a0was designed to protect borrowers in this circumstance.  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank or the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm which is regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Under the Consumer Protection\u00a0Act 2015, relevant borrowers whose loans are sold to third parties maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank\u00a0Act 2013\u00a0Regulations 2015, which came into operation on 1 July 2016.  The sale of a loan does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review\u00a0to ensure borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800028#AA00900","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1488302400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>While the Minister's response may sound great, the reality is that the credit servicing firms are only regulated or authorised by the Central Bank because they were operating in Ireland before the relevant legislation was enacted.

This means that not only are the vulture funds not regulated, but none of the credit servicing firms has been regulated under the new standards or received approval from the Central Bank under these standards.  Some 18 months after the enactment of the legislation, the reason these firms are defined as being regulated is that the so-called passporting section of the Act deemed them all to be regulated until such time as they met the new standards.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister sounded like Pontius Pilate as he washed his hands of this issue.  Tens of thousands of home owners' loans have been sold to vulture funds.

The investment funds that buy impaired loans are in the business of cutting deals and do so frequently.  I watched an RTE programme on the purchase of loans by investment funds and speaking during a panel discussion at the end of the programme, a very well-known individual, who is highly regarded by persons with impaired mortgages, stated it was his experience that it was much easier to deal with vulture funds to secure a reduction in the amount owed than it was to deal with the banks.

While this means that not all properties that are affected by pyrite are eligible for the exemption, it is accepted that the presence of pyrite, whether it has already caused structural damage to a property or has the potential to cause such damage, will have a negative effect on the market value of the property.  If the property was affected with pyrite on the valuation date then that can be reflected in the selected valuation band.  If a property owner feels that the valuation band selected on the valuation date of 1 May 2013 did not take account of the existence of pyrite then he or she should make contact with Revenue to discuss the possibility of reducing the band. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the qualifying criteria in respect of exemption from LPT for properties with significant pyritic damage were modified by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 which was signed into law on 20 December 2015.  The Act modified the qualifying criteria to include properties where a certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person as set down in the relevant regulations, the property has been accepted into the pyrite remediation scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board, an insurance company has remediated the property or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation or, the person who built the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation.<\/p>  <p>  The relaxation of the certification requirement was one of the recommendations made by Dr. Don Thornhill in his review of the operation of the local property tax on behalf of the Government in 2015.  The changes are significant in that where a property has been included in the pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, without testing, or a property has been remediated by a guarantee company or by a builder or developer or where a party is compensated in lieu of remediation, without testing, Revenue will now accept confirmation of remediation or compensation from the either the PRB or the relevant party for the purposes of exemption without testing or NSAI certification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800029#BB01400","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1488303000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The Minister has addressed the area where the scheme works to give people pyrite exemptions but he has not addressed the question, which is what does he propose to do to improve the areas where the exemption cannot be gained even though the homeowner's property is pyrite affected.

The level of relief allowable in any tax year in respect of the amount of interest paid, inclusive of any arrears paid, cannot exceed the applicable rates and ceilings for that year.  The applicable rate and ceiling for each qualifying person are determined by his or her personal circumstances, for example, whether he or she is a first-time buyer, single, married or in a civil partnership.<\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest ceilings that apply to first-time buyers - those within the first seven tax years of taking out their first mortgages - are &euro;10,000 for a single individual and &euro;20,000 for a married couple or civil partnership.  For subsequent years, the ceilings reduce to &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the scenarios set out in the Deputy's questions, Revenue has confirmed that the persons in question are entitled to claim MIR as soon as they restart making mortgage payments.  The relief entitlement may be increased to take account of the additional arrears payments being made, but the cumulative amount of relief granted cannot exceed the maximum level of the applicable rates and ceilings for the particular year in which the interest is paid.  \"Yes\" is the answer, and if they are making arrears payments, they can add the relevant interest as long as they remain below the ceiling.  Revenue has advised that the persons in question should contact its tax relief at source helpline at 1890 46 36 26 so the exact entitlement can be quantified, having due regard to the specific details of the cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is a programme for Government commitment to retain MIR beyond the current end date on a tapered basis.  Since legislation already provides for the relief to continue to the end of December 2017, it was not necessary to legislate for the extension in the Finance Bill 2016.  In my Budget Statement in October, however, I confirmed my intention to extend MIR on a tapered basis to 2020, with the details of the extension to be set out in budget 2018.

When Tesco management announced its intention to cut workers' pay and rip up the contracts of people who had worked for it, for three decades in some cases, forcing them out on strike, it assumed it could isolate a small group of workers within the workforce but it seriously underestimated two things.  The first is the workers within Tesco - the young and part-time workers who showed massive solidarity and understood that they were next in the firing line.  They also underestimated ordinary people.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reports that picketed stores lost sales of 80% but even non-picketed stores lost sales of 30%.  This shows the balance of forces in society, that things can be turned around, that the employers and the establishment which have had it their way for a very long time should take note and that the Government should take note of where the sympathies of the public lie in respect of bus workers and the ASTI where the Government is attempting similar union busting tactics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800033#FF00800","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1488305400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>We are not neutral in this dispute.

There is a lesson there for everybody - the teachers, nurses and Bus &Eacute;ireann workers - that standing strong and standing together will win public support and can win industrial disputes.

That lesson is critically needed given the similar orchestrated attempt to attack workers and trade unions in our public transport system.  Again, the public is being treated to a diet of frankly disingenuous nonsense about the viability of the company when what is happening is that subsidies for public transport are being undermined and private operators are being cosseted and promoted by the National Transport Authority with the assistance of the Government to undermine workers' pay and conditions in Bus &Eacute;ireann and the public transport system generally.

Contracts, such as those under dispute, may need to be modernised but the key question is why this updating should always result in preferential treatment for the company at the expense of the ordinary worker.  There is something particularly grasping and covetous about the manner in which Tesco has approached this matter.

I believe companies are emboldened by this stance from Government.  As a result, we see Tesco, a company which boasts about its market share, its growth and its profits, attack the terms and conditions of its most experienced employees, the backbone of the company.

However, I do ensure that the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, are equipped and resourced to handle industrial relations disputes that arise.  I believe they continue to serve the country very well.  They have settled many difficult disputes in the past, as Members of the House are aware.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is well aware, this dispute at Tesco relates to proposed changes to pre-1996 employee contracts for around 230 of the 14,500 staff employed at Tesco.  In situations such as this one, I would always advise and encourage parties to use the offices of the WRC and the Labour Court.  We can all welcome the fact that the parties have continued to do so on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  There was an extensive process of engagement and negotiation which culminated in August 2016 in the WRC making its own proposals for resolution of the issues at the request of the parties.  Those proposals were accepted by Tesco but rejected by the union side as they were not acceptable to their members.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was then referred to the Labour Court.  In November, the Labour Court recommended that the parties should engage in a locally based process over a period of eight weeks in an attempt to allow settlement at local store level.  The court recommended that the process should be guided generally by the content of the WRC proposals.  If that did not succeed, the Labour Court recommended that the WRC proposals should then be accepted as the means of national resolution of the issues.  Tesco accepted the Labour Court recommendation.  The union side rejected the Labour Court recommendation and did not engage in this local process.<\/p>  <p>  After balloting its members, Mandate served strike notice on Tesco and industrial action commenced on Tuesday, 14 February at eight stores.  Union ballots for action continued up to Friday last, 24 February.  It is reported that Mandate had balloted members in 45 stores, with 22 voting in favour and 23 voting against strike action.  Tesco indicated at the time that all of its 148 stores would continue to remain open despite the industrial action going ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Court, having previously issued its recommendation, which included a number of processes that still have not occurred, initiated contact last week with IBEC and ICTU and invited those parties to a general discussion relating to the dispute.<\/p>  <p>  Last Friday, 24 February, the parties voluntarily agreed to take part in talks under the auspices of the Labour Court and they should be given time to resolve this dispute with the help of the industrial relations institutions of the State.  I hope the Deputies can join me in encouraging all sides to make every effort to reach a resolution, by agreement, between the company management and the workers represented by their trade union.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, it must be remembered that this is a difficult industrial relations dispute; the company has not changed anyone&rsquo;s contract unilaterally.  The parties in this dispute are availing of the services of the State.  They both jointly agreed to engage with the Labour Court last Friday.  Mandate has suspended industrial action and the company has agreed to make no changes to contracts pending the outcome of talks.  That is a positive sign from both sides and this move by the parties should be respected.<\/p>  <p>  Our industrial relations institutions have been heavily involved in this dispute and relevant officials are continuing their involvement to assist the parties to resolve the dispute.  All sides must now be encouraged to make every effort to reach a resolution by agreement between the company management and the workers represented by their trade unions.

It is the third category of intellectual property assets that the current Bill is concerned with and for which a new certification scheme is proposed.  The KDB is already operational for the first two categories, patents and copyrighted software, since 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>This third category of assets is targeted at small and medium-sized companies with a view to ensuring that they too can qualify for the KDB.  The Finance Act imposes certain financial limitations on the definition of companies that qualify in this category.  The limitations are for companies with income arising from intellectual property of less than &euro;7.5 million and with global income of less than &euro;50 million.  The legislation will, when enacted, be of direct benefit to companies of a relatively smaller economic scale.  We have almost 2,000 companies performing R&amp;amp;D activities in Ireland with turnover under &euro;50 million and they will be able to access the KDB through this proposed new scheme.<\/p><p>A secondary purpose of the Bill is to re-introduce substantive patent examination for Irish patents.  Under the Patents Act 1992, the activity of substantive patent examination was discontinued at the Irish Patents office.  The Finance Act provides that in order for patents to qualify for the KDB they must be granted following a process of substantive patent examination.  This is designed to ensure that only the highest quality patents qualify for the KDB.<\/p><p>The amendments in the Bill to the Patents Act have the effect of reintroducing substantive patent examination in Ireland.  This will result in higher quality Irish patents in line with best international practice.  Moreover, the intention is to ensure that Irish patents will continue to qualify for the KDB.<\/p><p>Evidence shows that investment in R&amp;amp;D increases economic productivity, competitiveness and improves health, social and environmental outcomes.  Firms with a persistent R&amp;amp;D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&amp;amp;D investment program.  R&amp;amp;D is crucial for creating and maintaining high value jobs and for attracting new business.  However, it is the case that depending on the product or process, R&amp;amp;D can be very expensive and not all R&amp;amp;D is successful.  A company may experience many failed attempts before it sees results from investment of time, money and resources.  These can be considerable, particularly for SMEs.  Therefore the extension of the KDB to indigenous small and medium-sized companies is expected to incentivise greater levels of innovation with a view to leading to increased job creation.  Promoting innovation is a concern for me in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for innovation.  <\/p><p>By way of background, I should say that the KDB was introduced in response to the OECD&rsquo;s consideration of harmful tax practices.  Ireland has the first fully compliant Knowledge Development Box that meets the new OECD guidelines, developed following this consideration.  The overall KDB scheme comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  <\/p><p>The report on tax expenditures published with the budget in October 2015 provides an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation of the KDB scheme.  This evaluation outlines the basis of the best estimate of tax forgone for the Exchequer of &euro;50 million.  This &euro;50 million is in respect of&rsquo; all aspects of the KDB, including the certification scheme aimed at SMEs, which is the purpose of this Bill.<\/p><p>All tax expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis in line with the Department of Finance guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation published in October 2014.  These rules apply to the Knowledge Development Box and an evaluation will take place within five years of the introduction of the scheme.  The review of the overall KDB scheme will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>A certificate granted under this Bill provides the gateway for SMEs to apply the 6.25% corporate tax rate on profits arising from the invention.  Grant of a KDB certificate does not, however, guarantee that the SME qualifies for this lower rate of corporation tax.  Revenue will consider tax returns on the basis of the provisions applicable to the KDB scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 January 2016.  Revenue will have the necessary information on the KDB to provide reliable information to Government on an ongoing basis on the use of the KDB to inform future evaluations of this initiative.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the specifics of the Bill and set out what each section is intended to do.  As I have already mentioned, the intention in the Bill is to introduce a certification scheme for SMEs in respect of their intellectual property assets in the nature of inventions.  This scheme involves the Controller of Patent, Designs and Trade Marks as the designated State authority to certify the assets as being novel, non-obvious and useful.  When examining applications under the scheme, the controller will apply the same criteria used to establish novelty and inventiveness as that which currently applies to patents. <\/p><p>Unlike patent holders, companies granted a KDB certificate will not have to publicly disclose the nature of their invention.  Nor will they have a monopoly and market exclusivity rights for that asset.  The certificate will assist SMEs to qualify to apply the lower rate of corporate tax of 6.25% to profits arising from the IP asset.  This is half the normal corporate tax rate of 12.5%.  Let me be clear that the KDB certificate will not of itself automatically mean that a company qualifies for the lower tax rate.  The Revenue Commissioners can, and will, carry out their own assessments to ensure that a valid basis exists for the company to claim the lower rate of corporate tax.  This practice already exists in the context of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme where Revenue can randomly undertake assessments or audits.  The certificate is one step in the qualification process for the lower tax rate.  Companies that can qualify for this certification scheme are those with less than 250 employees and income of less than &euro;7.5 million arising from intellectual property.  Global turnover from intellectual property must be less than &euro;50 million.  The profits must result from R&amp;amp;D activities carried out in Ireland.<\/p><p>The second purpose of the Bill is to amend the Patents Act 1992 by requiring that in the future all Irish patents granted will be on the basis of substantive patent examination only.  Under the current system, it is possible to grant Irish patents on the strength of evidence of novelty in the form of a search report.  These amendments will ensure that all Irish patents granted after this Bill is enacted will be of a high quality in line with best international practice.<\/p><p>Moreover, it will ensure that all patents granted by the Irish Patents Office will continue to qualify for the KDB.<\/p> <p> I propose in this Bill to introduce a substantive patent examination regime for Irish patents.  These changes signal a change in the manner in which the Patents Office will examine patent applications in the future.  The Irish Patents Office has a long standing arrangement with the UK Intellectual Property Office to provide evidence of novelty in the form of a search report.  When the Bill is enacted, a search report alone will no longer satisfy the evidence of novelty requirements but will in addition require a written opinion.  This additional service is also being acquired from the UK Patent Office.  That is patentability.  We will require an opinion on that. <\/p> <p> Looking at the Bill in detail, Part 1 includes sections 1 to 3 and contains standard legislative provisions relating to Title, commencement, citation, definitions and expenses.<\/p> <p> Part 2 contains sections 4 to 6 and sets out the mandatory criteria that applications for inventions under the scheme must meet.  This part sets out also the mandatory exceptions and these are common also to the exceptions that apply in patent law.  Section 4 sets out the criteria that an invention must meet in order to qualify for a KDB certificate.  Put simply, the invention must be novel, non-obvious and useful.  This section also lists those inventions that are not considered to be inventions for the purposes of KDB, for example, the invention cannot be granted a certificate if it is a discovery or a scientific theory.  Section 5 defines specific inventions that are excluded for reasons such as that the commercial exploitation of the invention would be contrary to public order or morality or that the invention is a plant or animal variety derived from a biological process.  Section 6 provides that a KDB certificate will typically issue for one distinct invention.<\/p> <p> Part 3 contains sections 7 to 15.  It deals with the specific and detailed application requirements under the scheme to the controller including an outline of the controller&rsquo;s decision-making process and review process.<\/p> <p> Section 7 sets out the qualification criteria and financial limits for companies that can apply under the KDB certificate scheme and establishes the information requirements for applications under the scheme.  Essentially, the application will have to contain the title and a clear, concise, detailed description of the invention, the date on which the invention began to be used, produced or marketed, the novel features or improvements of the invention that did not previously exist, along with description of its advantageous effects, and be accompanied by an opinion from a patent agent attesting that the invention is novel, non-obvious and useful.<\/p> <p> Section 8 deals with applications that are submitted but do not initially meet all the requirements laid out in section 7.  The controller can write to the applicant identifying the requirements that were not met.  The controller can defer consideration of the application until the revised application is submitted.  If no response is made to the controller&rsquo;s notice the application is deemed withdrawn after a period of time.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for the treatment of applications in respect of two or more inventions.  A certificate can typically be issued in respect of a single invention only.  Under section 9 the controller can invite the applicant to choose which element of the invention should be considered for certification purposes.  The applicant can make a separate application or applications for the other inventive elements of the application.<\/p> <p> Section 10 allows the applicant to withdraw an application at any time before the issue of a KDB certificate.  Section 11 provides that an applicant who initially withdrew an application is not prevented from lodging the same application again at a later date.  Section 12 provides the controller can issue a KDB certificate if he is satisfied the invention meets all requirements set out in Part 2.  It also outlines the particulars that will be included on the KDB certificate.  Section 13 outlines the procedures to be adhered to if the controller refuses to issue a KDB certificate.  In this situation the controller must clearly set out the reasons in writing for the refusal.  Section 14 offers the applicant a review of the original decision.  This involves an internal appeals process in which the reviewer will be of a grade senior to the original deciding officer.  This reviewer will confirm or cancel the original decision.  Under section 15 an application containing new information may be made in respect of an invention for which a certificate has been refused.<\/p> <p> Part 4 contains sections 16 to 19 which deal with the administration of the KDB certification scheme.  Section 16 allows the controller to authorise officers of the Patents Office to carry out functions under the Bill on his behalf.  This is typically to allow the patent examiners at the office to examine applications under the scheme.<\/p> <p> Section 17 deals with the confidential nature of the KDB certification applications.  The controller is required to keep records of all applications received, certificates granted, refusals to issue a certificate and reviews undertaken.  As applications will contain commercially sensitive information it is essential that they be kept confidential.  The controller will not disclose the invention publicly or advertise it in any way.  This section also provides that anyone dealing with an application on behalf of the controller will be guilty of an offence if they disclose any information submitted in support of the application.<\/p> <p> Section 18 provides for an annual report containing statistical information to be provided by the Controller of Patents to the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as part of the controller&rsquo;s annual report.  This report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 19 is a standard indemnity provision protecting the controller and his staff from legal proceedings as long as they have acted in good faith in the course of their official duties.<\/p> <p> Part 5 of the Bill contains sections 20 to 24.  Section 20 creates an offence for the forging and use of forged documentation under the Bill.  Section 21 enables the Minister to make rules providing for fees and time periods referred to in the Bill.  Section 22 creates an offence whereby an officer of a corporate body that commits an offence, is also guilty of the offence.  Section 23 is the standard provision concerning the disposal of fees to the Exchequer.  Section 24 enables the controller to specify the form of any document referred to the in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Part 6, containing sections 25 to 31, amends a small number of provisions in the Patents Act 1992.  The amendments have the effect of reintroducing substantive patent examination for Irish patent applications.  Substantive examination involves the detailed examination of a patent application to assess novelty and inventive step.<\/p> <p> Section 26 is a transitional provision intended to cover the position of patent applications filed under the Patents Act 1992 but before the coming into effect of the amended provisions in this Bill.  It clarifies that the new regime will apply to patent applications made after the Bill is commenced.  Applications made prior to this date will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Patents Act 1992.<\/p> <p> Section 27 amends section 29 of the Patents Act which requires that a report and a written opinion as to patentability must be filed with the office.  It is against this evidence that the Patents Office will substantially examine the application.  Section 28, which amends section 30 of the Patents Act, enables the submission of similar evidence of novelty from a foreign patent office.  Section 29 allows the controller to consider observations from third parties on the issue of the patentability of an invention.  Section 30 amends section 31 of the Patents Act.  It empowers the controller to refuse a patent application that does not comply with the requirements as to novelty, inventive step and industrial application.<\/p> <p> Section 31 of the Bill amends the annual reporting provisions in section 103 of the Patents Act.  Whereas the controller currently lays his annual report before the Oireachtas, the changes introduced by the Bill will require him to make his annual report to the Minister who in turn will lay it before the Oireachtas.  This is in keeping with current good corporate governance practices applicable to offices and agencies.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to commend this Bill to the house.  I look forward with interest to the contributions of Members on this and subsequent Stages of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800038#LL00200","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488309600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Deputies Niall Collins and James Lawless are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800040#NN00100","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1488309600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 and looks forward to strengthening its provisions on Committee Stage.  The Bill will enable SMEs, which employ around 920,000 people nationwide, to avail of the knowledge development box, KDB, taxation scheme on profits relating to research and development activities, with a reduced corporation tax rate of 6.25%.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also extends the KDB definition of intellectual property beyond patents and copyrighted software to what has been referred as the IP equivalent to a patentable invention.  This will permit Irish SMEs to include inventions that are certified as novel, non-obvious and useful.  However, it has been pointed out that the certification will be decided by the Patents Office, the same entity which decides on patents.  While the this measure was announced in October 2014, successive Fine Gael-led Governments must be criticised for taking over two years to come forward with primary legislation to enable SMEs access this tax scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The freezing of this Bill is appalling considering that there are provisions in it to reduce the regulatory and compliance burden on micro and medium-sized enterprises.  Given how exposed Irish exporters are to a hard Brexit, this is yet another example of the slow response by the Government before and after the UK referendum in taking every measure at its disposal to safeguard Irish SME business and employment.  In this regard, I would call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to immediately complete Report Stage of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 and accept amendments put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il that will secure high value Irish jobs as a Brexit contingency measure.  However, the UK&rsquo;s competitive edge for enterprise and attracting new businesses and jobs has seen Ireland slip further and further behind our near neighbour.  Despite the Government's attempt to claim that Irish competitiveness levels are improving, the latest statistics say otherwise.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has continued to plunge on the Word Bank&rsquo;s ratings for the ease of doing business across 190 economies, dropping to eighteenth in its 2017 report.  The Taoiseach has failed to meet his 2016 target of making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  Ireland has fallen behind Georgia, Latvia, Estonia and Macedonia in global rankings.  Budget 2017 did not close the competitiveness deficit with the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  The UK will still has a more attractive capital gains tax relief which applies a 10% rate to entrepreneurial gains of up to &pound;10 million, far in excess of the &euro;1 million Irish limit.  The current regime still puts Ireland at a competitive disadvantage as a location to conduct business in.  The chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association has said that the reduced capital gains tax rate does not bring us onto the racetrack given that the UK had a ceiling that was ten times the scale of Ireland&rsquo;s &pound;1 million threshold.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce said that the changes will do little to stem the flow of start-up companies moving to the UK from Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Irish start-ups are also attracted to the UK enterprise investment scheme which makes early-stage capital much more readily available in the UK.  In Ireland, the employment and investment incentive scheme provides individual investors with tax relief of 30% in respect of investments of up to &euro;150,000 per annum.  However in the UK, the enterprise investment, which is similar to the enterprise investment scheme in Ireland, enables investors to receive tax relief of 30% on investments of up to &pound;1 million.<\/p>  <p>  The UK is planning to reduce its corporation tax rate to 17%, which would bring it closer to Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% rate.  The Government needs to use every available tool to make the current regulatory landscape a more attractive location to retain and attract new businesses and entrepreneurs to establish in Ireland.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister has refused to review her Department's ten year strategic enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025, following the Brexit vote.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has called for the immediate review of all the employment and export targets in Enterprise 2025 following publication of two recent ESRI Brexit impact reports.  There is no allowance in the Enterprise 2025 forecasts, published over 12 months ago, for the impact of Brexit on Ireland in regard to employment levels and export targets based on the various UK trading scenarios that might emerge in a hard Brexit scenario.  <\/p>  <p>  The ESRI report, Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland, indicated a hard Brexit with Britain operating under WTO trading rules would result in Irish unemployment increasing by 2%.  Another ESRI report, The Product and Sector Level Impact of a Hard Brexit across the EU, laid out a chilling picture for Irish exporters and related jobs.  In a WTO tariff scenario post-Brexit, Irish exports to the UK would be the most exposed in the EU, leading to a reduction of 4% of total exports.  Shockingly, Ireland would face a severe tariff exposure.  While we make up 5% of the UK&rsquo;s total imports, we would be charged nearly 20% of the total EU tariff.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to play a proactive role with business scenario planning, so that Irish companies impacted by Brexit can take informed strategic and commercial decisions to plan for this situation.  The Minister needs to review her Enterprise 2025 strategic document.  We are happy to support the Bill on Second Stage and will seek to amend it, where necessary, on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800040#NN00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1488309600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>As a Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on science, technology and research, I am pleased to support the Bill and commend it to the House.  I agree with the comments of my colleague, Deputy Collins, in terms of the Bill and its place in the wider context.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the Bill is very necessary and welcome, and will make a significant difference to SMEs in terms of how they engage with research and innovation activities.  It has many sensible sections, which the Minister of State and my colleague have already detailed.  It is important to step back from the detail and consider the wider international context. <\/p>  <p>  We are well aware that we are in an economic battle with other countries.  The advent of President Trump in the United States, the march of Brexit in the UK and the wider context of the EU and efforts to introduce a common consolidated tax base and other such measures are all of concern.<\/p>  <p>  We have always praised and taken pride in the many attributes we have.  Our low corporation tax rate has been one such positive measure.  Our English speaking vernacular, the dialects of our workforce and the fact we are in the eurozone are all very important measures in terms of international competition when we are looking for jobs and encouraging businesses to locate, centre and start up here.  However, as is often the case, our greatest asset is our people.  Our highly educated, motivated and creative workforce is the real secret to our success.<\/p>  <p>  I recently had a conversation with Mr. Eamonn Sinnott from Intel, who is a remarkable man in his own right.  We discussed the Ireland's Edge project, with which I am sure the Minister of State and my colleagues are familiar.  High-tech employers and academics set out to try to capture what makes the Irish unique in terms of creativity and innovation.  We have seen those attributes across the arts, the sciences and the business world.  It is very difficult to quantify, but we can all agree that there is a unique and positive attribute of the Irish people, namely, that we are a creative people and make things happen.  The core of this Bill is to reward that in every sense, including in a monetary sense.  The talent, education and skills bases are what give us a competitive advantage, and mean that, despite international events, we can triumph. <\/p>  <p>  I understand the knowledge development box is in the context of the OECD and base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative.  I understand we are the first country in the world to follow through and introduce an OECD compliant tax measure of this sort.  That is very welcome and something of which we should be proud.  We are a world leader in that sense.  I understand the Bill will replace the double Irish, which was phased out a couple of years ago.  It makes a lot of sense to introduce such a measure, and it is critical in allowing innovation to succeed and be rewarded.<\/p>  <p>  The research and development tax credit is a similar measure, which allows for a 25% return on innovative activities.  However, following the extension of the knowledge development box to SMEs, perhaps we could learn from the operation of the research and development tax credit already in place.  It is a fine measure and helps to stimulate research and innovation.<\/p><p>In a previous life, I worked on a project that qualified and saw this in action.  However, I have spoken to SMEs that have told me very few of them have engaged on the R&amp;D tax credit.  Despite the welcome extension of the knowledge development box to SMEs, I would worry that the same pitfalls would face them.<\/p> <p> One of the reasons the R&amp;D tax credit is apparently not as useful to SMEs as it could or should be is the uncertainty about eligibility or the credit's application.  If an SME, by definition a smaller company with limited resources, is to invest in an invention or innovative project with the view to later on claiming back an R&amp;D tax credit or in this case a knowledge development box tax credit, it might find that it falls foul of Revenue because of a lack of Revenue guidelines.  There is an uncertainty about what projects fit the bill and there is the possibility of a retrospective audit or a Revenue spot check three or more years later.  Revenue can come back to the company and state that the innovative project that the company claimed an R&amp;D tax credit for did not qualify and state why.  There seems to be discrepancies and a lack of consistency in the application of the credit which is off-putting to companies that have limited resources and are trying to decide where to concentrate those resources.  They are afraid that a couple of years down the line there may be a claw-back from Revenue on activity that they in good faith entered into with the intention of claiming the credit.  Perhaps the Minister and those in the Department might examine that issue from the R&amp;D tax credit point of view and with the knowledge development box in mind as well because some guidelines would be useful.<\/p> <p> From speaking to colleagues in SMEs and bodies such as the Small Firms Association and ISME, I know that there was a successful initiative a couple of years ago which was called JobsPlus.  SMEs were encouraged to take on a worker, that is, to take someone from the unemployment queue and into the workforce, for which they received a direct credit.  I think a payment was made to help them pay the cost of hiring the worker.  It was a direct job activation measure that took people into the workforce but there was a very real commodity in the sense that there was an actual financial and direct support provided to the company to take on the worker.  For SMEs with limited resources, a tax credit down the road versus a cash payment right now is like a bird in the bush being worth two in the hand, as they say - or is the other way around?  Whatever it is, having the income now is better than having it potentially as a credit in a year's time.  Something like a JobsPlus for R&amp;D would be welcome and would make sense as it would allow companies to directly intervene because they could with good knowledge and in confidence embark on a research policy.  I suggest to the Minister and the House such an initiative for research in the way that there was JobsPlus in the past.<\/p> <p> On a critical note that is relevant to today's debate, I am very disappointed about the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI.  I raised this issue a number of times in the House over the past six months and again last week under the Order of Business.  If we are to develop the knowledge economy and innovation and reward research, both at academic and business levels right down to the SME sector, which compares with some of the research institutions, we have to be serious about it and serious about funding it.  From the figures I received on the PRTLI in the past couple of days, I understand it is now cut down to &euro;14.4 million for the 2017 round.  This is more than a 50% cut on the previous year which in itself was small fry compared to what it was in previous years.  Since its introduction in 1998, the PRTLI has been a successful research fund that was targeted across many different academic institutions, projects and disciplines.  It was broadly based and encompassed humanities as well as the STEM area.  However, it appears to have been eroded constantly to the point that its funding is now &euro;14.4 million, which is small money compared to other research projects.<\/p> <p> I note that the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, from whose reply to the parliamentary question the figures emerged, referred to funding for Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which is extremely welcome.  It is a fantastic agency which does fantastic work and I praised it in this House only last week in the context of another debate, but there cannot be a one size fits all approach.  Funding for SFI and other institutions is no excuse for robbing Peter to pay Paul and cutting back the PRTLI which has a broader appeal, is available to draw down by other institutions and universities and can be matched with, for instance, European research council funding.  There were Supplementary Estimates in both 2015 and 2016 for the PRTLI and I appeal to the Minister and the Department to examine whether the &euro;14.34 million could be bumped up.  The programme is very deserving and the research institutions and universities will need it.<\/p> <p> To put in context how it can be used, I visited a number of universities over the past number of months.  They showed me, for instance, where a new building was commissioned, a new lab was designed or new measuring equipment was put in place using PRTLI funding.  Five or ten years on, the equipment is being to fail.  It is the equivalent of having a brand new school where in the classroom the children have no schoolbooks or outdated ones.  The PRTLI funded the bread and butter machinery, buildings, equipment and resources.  It is a much needed fund as opposed to other funds that may be more particular to research teams and high potential individuals.  Those are also necessary but they are two different things and both need to be resourced equally because they are both extremely important.<\/p> <p> We welcome the Bill and will support it.  Its extension to SMEs is needed.  SMEs are agile, versatile and up for a challenge.  Many of them would love to invest in R&amp;D and perform more innovative activities but, as I have outlined, there are practical obstacles to them doing so.  I commend the Bill.  As I stated, we will support it but I hope that some of the obstacles will be addressed during the passage of the Bill or through other measures.  I rest my contribution there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800040#NN00300","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488310200,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maurice Quinlivan who has 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800041#OO00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1488310200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I do not think I will need that much time but we will see what we can do.  I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill but Sinn F&eacute;in has a few issues that it will raise on Committee Stage although we will raise most of them before then.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Bill is technical in nature.  Its primary aim is to amend sections of the Patents Act 1992 to allow for the introduction of a substantive examination of patent applications and facilitate the issuing of long-term patents, with a certification scheme for the knowledge development box which will allow small companies to qualify.  Once certified, SMEs involved in research activities will be able to avail of a reduced corporation tax rate of 6.25%.  As explained in the Bill, an SME is a company with no more than 250 employees, intellectual property assets of less than &euro;7.5 million and global turnover of less than &euro;50 million.  We have to measure this description against that of very small community businesses that are crippled by rates, rents and various taxes, practically none of which they can avoid or on none of which they get deals.<\/p>  <p>  My party believes it is well past time for an honest debate on corporation tax.  Just this week the European Commission again attacked the reckless tax-cutting agenda of the Government and its use of volatile corporation tax receipts to underpin spending.  In the past my party&rsquo;s finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, dared to mention the name of a particular company, Apple, but he was shouted down by Fine Gael Deputies, including the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy.  This is the level of maturity that this and previous Governments have shown when it comes to a discussion about corporation tax.  That this remains the position, even in the face of recent EU ruling against Apple, is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports having an open, transparent and competitive all-Ireland corporation tax rate which does not allow large multinationals off the hook in respect of their tax responsibilities.  It is said that the knowledge development box is the first such scheme in the world to comply with the terms of the OECD project on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, to minimise corporations' efforts to minimise their tax liabilities.  It is also said it is to encourage investment specifically in research and development activities by reducing the tax companies pay on earnings.  My party is all for indigenous Irish companies that can grow and employ significant numbers.  One hopes these companies will be much more loyal to the country than those which up and leave overnight once economic conditions deteriorate, as we have seen happen on too many occasions.  We need to focus on supporting small SMEs that will have a loyalty to their communities, their staff and their country.  That said, the measures in today&rsquo;s Bill needs to be seen for what they are - a further tax avoidance measure that the ordinary Joe Public simply cannot avail of.  Companies with a turnover of up to &euro;50 million will be allowed to pay half the tax they are due to pay, which is wrong.  These are not abstract figures but resources that in many cases are desperately needed to fund our schools, hospitals and infrastructure and to invest in both job creation and retention and to protect Ireland from the negatives impacts of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  There is also uncertainty about how the scheme will be monitored in obtaining a knowledge development box, KDB, certificate.  The invention by the company will have to be novel, non-obvious and useful.  The terminology is extremely ambiguous.  Therefore, who will determine which companies will meet the conditions laid down?  Will it be the Patents Office alone?  It is also unclear how much tax will be forgone following the introduction of the KDB certificate.<\/p><p>How does the Minister expect Members to support the legislation when we do not know what liability the State will assume once it has been introduced?  This is being done during the worst housing and health crisis ever in the State when most public services have been squeezed to the bone.<\/p> <p> It is also unclear how many small and medium enterprises will make investments in research and development activities to avail of the proposed measure.  As we are all well aware, it is the large corporations rather than SMEs that like to use these types of loopholes and which, in many cases, have the resources and ability to access them.  It is stated in the roadmap for Ireland's tax competitiveness that we must place ourselves in the best possible position to become the country of choice for mobile foreign direct investment in a post-BEPS - base erosion and profit shifting - environment.  Do we really want to introduce further loopholes to attract companies because of a cheap tax regime, while we hammer citizens with a litany of unfair taxes?<\/p> <p> The Bill and the implementation of the knowledge development box, KDB, scheme will also require changes to the current patent process.  It is unclear if the KDB certificate process will be cheaper than the patent process.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.<\/p> <p> The changes in the patent process will allow third parties to make written observations on a patent application to the controller before a patent is granted.  Who are these third parties?  It is startling and unbelievable that the Irish Patents Office relies on the UK patents office to provide a patent search report in deciding if an Irish patent should be granted.  Will the Minister explain exactly why this is still the case?  This scenario will surely have to be reviewed in the light of Brexit.  When the Bill was drafted and the concept of a knowledge box introduced, the Brexit referendum had not yet taken place.  Where does the decision on Brexit leave us and what specific action is the Minister taking to address the issue?  It is also unclear whether the changes proposed in the Bill will have implications for the cost of a new patent.  When will this be made clear?<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is sceptical about introducing further tax avoidance schemes.  In the roadmap to which I referred reputation is regarded as a key pillar.  Ireland's reputation was damaged considerably by the aptly named double Irish arrangement.  In 2013, the Minister for Finance announced that we did not operate a tax haven, yet one year later he closed down the double Irish mechanism.  I do not want our reputation to be damaged further by the introduction of a replacement scheme.  Political parties and elected officials from across the political spectrum should, in the interests of the people they represent, ensure highly profitable companies will are tax responsible and pay tax in a transparent manner at the appropriate rate of 12.5%.<\/p> <p> There are two pillars, rates and regimes.  As I indicated, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the 12.5% corporation tax rate provided tax is paid at this rate.  As part of our all-Ireland strategy, we would welcome this rate even more if it applied on an all-lreland basis.  Brexit will be a game changer and we need to be ready for it.  In the past, our tax regime has been probed in the United States, Australia, Britain and, most recently, by the European Commission.  It is important to note that knowledge development box-type schemes introduced in other jurisdictions are being examined, questioned and probed by other authorities.<\/p> <p> A mature debate on Ireland's corporation tax regime and reputation is required.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants Ireland to be a responsible member of the international community, with no clouds hanging over our tax reputation.  The right of the Government to set its own tax rates, including the corporation tax rate, is one Sinn F&eacute;in has always defended, particularly in Brussels.  However, the introduction of a research and development loophole and knowledge development box, with tax rates of as low as 6% and 6.5%, will leave another cloud hanging over us.<\/p> <p> The evidence to date is that knowledge development boxes have been used internationally as a tax avoidance tool in many cases.  This legislation will only entrench such a negative perception.  There are fairer ways of encouraging investment in research and development than introducing a measure that will undoubtedly be used by some corporations to avoid paying taxes.<\/p> <p> As the Minister will be aware, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced amendments to the legislation in the Seanad, some of which we will resubmit on Committee Stage and, if necessary, Report Stage because the Government has not addressed our concerns.  I ask the Minister to address the points I have raised in the interests of restoring our reputation and ensuring we create a fair and equal society, particularly for businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800041#OO00300","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488310800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>We are very strongly opposed to this Bill.  The so-called knowledge development box is being sold as a reasonable incentive to small and medium enterprise to develop our innovative edge.  The implication is that the scheme will have a positive benefit on the domestic economy.  This is the view expressed by the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I do not know what the Labour Party's position is as it is not represented in the Chamber.  We will see what its Deputies have to say on how the knowledge development box will benefit small and medium enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures available on the level of tax the corporate sector pays on gross profits refer to 2014, although I understand figures for 2015 will be available soon.  The figures show the corporate tax code is full of loopholes that are being used to rob taxpayers of vital tax revenues which could be used to develop infrastructure and fund our universities, the most important locations for the types of innovation and technological developments that would benefit the entire economy.  They are also being used to rob the State generally of the revenues it needs for investment in strategic enterprise and industry, infrastructure, public services, technological development and upgrading the education system to make it the real driving force of innovation. <\/p>  <p>  What is being sold as something that is good for the economy and innovation is in reality a massive tax break for profit interests and members of the public need to know the scale involved.  The 2014 figures show the corporate sector benefits from tax loopholes worth &euro;35 billion.  Gross pre-tax profits for corporations stood at &euro;95 billion in 2014.  However, after what are described as deductions and charges, the figure decreases to &euro;65 billion, with further deductions of &euro;4 billion made through another series of loopholes.  This means the taxable figure is reduced by &euro;35 billion through loopholes or tax breaks that do not benefit the economy or society.  Before considering the introduction of further tax breaks, we must address the current loopholes that have created a gaping hole in the potential tax revenue of the State.  Incidentally, the figures I have cited were provided by the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p>  <p>  Large multinational corporations are engaging in aggressive tax evasion or avoidance, whichever term one wishes to use, and some major domestic interests are also benefitting from tax loopholes.  It is now proposed to introduce another loophole.  The idea that the purpose of the knowledge development box is primarily to benefit small and medium enterprise must be set against the definition of a small and medium enterprise.  According to the legislation, a small and medium enterprise is a company with an income arising from intellectual property of less than &euro;7.5 million and global income of less than &euro;50 million.  These are not figures we associate with small and medium enterprises.  The companies involved will not be corner shops or start-up companies in the local enterprise centre.  To set income thresholds of &euro;7.5 million domestically and &euro;50 million globally is to stretch the definition of a small and medium enterprise.  Many large companies will benefit from this measure.<\/p><p>However, the bulk of small and medium enterprise in this country will not gain from it.  The same old crowd will benefit.  What is not clear is how the big multinationals who exceed the thresholds in terms of their global incomes will be prevented from benefitting.  We are well aware that they can massage their incomes, and have done so, such that they pay no tax at all or pay less than 1% in tax.  They are well capable, through the internal allocation and movement of profits, of reducing their incomes in order to avoid paying tax.  <\/p> <p> Leaving that aside, in terms of the thresholds, where are the safeguards to ensure big companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook and so on do not set up a number of small companies, or put in place arrangements with small companies that they help to set up, and channel innovations through them?  It seems there is nothing to stop that.  I suspect that is exactly what they will do.  The one thing these companies are very innovative at doing is avoiding tax.  They have shown a remarkable ability to navigate around tax codes, usually with the active collusion of the political establishment, as happened here, and possibly, on the part of Revenue, in terms of what happened in the Apple case, although that is not yet clear but certainly has to be examined.  We will learn more about that from the investigation into the Apple case but that there was political collusion in terms of tax avoidance of that I have no doubt.  That there was collusion in some form or another with Revenue in terms of these tax rulings is a possibility, at least.  This is what we are dealing with.  Against that background, we are introducing another tax avoidance loophole-incentive based around the notion of intellectual property.  <\/p> <p> In regard to \"intellectual property\", it was stated that we are in the world of intellectual property now because of technological invention.  This is a very old idea.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, as somebody who comes from the left should understand this point.  The idea that the entrepreneur's idea is the generator of wealth is not a new idea, rather it is an old idea, and a very right wing idea.  The workers making the products do not matter and neither do the people in the call centres selling them.  They are irrelevant.  There is little value put on them but a lot of value on the person with the brilliant idea yet the person with the brilliant idea gets away with paying no tax while the poor workers producing or selling the products pay taxes at levels that are a multiple of that paid by these brilliant entrepreneurs.  Where do most of these innovations come from? When one traces them back one finds that some of the biggest most profitable companies in the world have effectively stolen the ideas for which they hold patents and generate huge profits from public institutions, such as, in the case of America, the military, or in our case, the universities.  That is an important point.  In Ireland much of the innovation comes not from the military but from our universities.  When one traces back the origins of these intellectual properties which have made huge profits for private companies one finds that many of them were developed in universities rather than by the brilliant entrepreneurs who end up with profits that are incomprehensible and on which they pay no tax.   <\/p> <p> As a student of literature I must point out that up until the poet Wordsworth there was no notion of copyright.  Wordsworth was one of the people who championed the notion of individual ownership of ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800042#PP00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488311400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>It dates back to Brehon law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800043#QQ00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1488311400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Yes but in a lot of societies and, to my mind, the more progressive societies, the idea that anybody individually owned an idea was considered nonsensical, and it is nonsensical because ideas are generated by society.  People often claim the credit for them or they have the machinery to take out patents on them before anybody else and so they claim they own the idea.  Now, we are proposing that such people will not have to pay any tax on the enormous profits they generate from supposedly their ideas.  As I said, ideas are generated out of societies collectively.<\/p>  <p>  I am against this proposal.  I reiterate that every tax break given to for-profit entities reduces the amount of revenue the State has to put into the universities.  I am for innovation, very much for it.  Our universities are starved of money.  That is where the money needs to go.  All we are doing is making things more difficult for our universities.  Grants for postgraduates were cut and have still not been restored.  These are the people who come up with ideas but we cut their grants and increased their fees.  Funding for many of our third level institutions has been cut over the last eight or nine years.  If we continue to give away billions of euro every year via tax loopholes to these companies we will have less money to put into the universities that could actually champion real innovation and socially useful innovation.  What is a socially useful innovation?  For a private company the criteria in terms of an innovation is will it make money and not will it benefit society?<\/p>  <p>  This is our money that is being used to provide tax breaks.  Do we want these resources to be given primarily to people who are pursuing profit or we would rather them go into public institutions that have some semblance of what is in the best interests of society as a whole, be that in relation to the development of renewable energies, new technologies or strategic industries that will benefit society?  It should be the latter yet they are being starved.<\/p>  <p>  We are joining in the race to the bottom.  It makes me weep.  We have been warning - the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was with us on this for many years - that Ireland is leading the race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxation, not in terms of the 12.5% rate but the average 6% rate that companies actually pay.  Interestingly, the same percentage is chosen for the beneficiaries of the knowledge development box.  As we know, a combination of small and medium enterprise are paying 12.5% as against the big profitable corporations who are paying 2%, 1% or even less than that.  In some cases, they are paying less than 1%.  We led and continue to lead that race to the bottom, but we are now being out-flanked by the maniac Trump who wants to reduce it even further and by Prime Minister, Theresa May.  In the North, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have jumped into this space, with Sinn F&eacute;in calling for a 12.5% rate in the North and the DUP calling for a 10% rate.<\/p>  <p>  Where does it end?  Every time we give away money like this there is less investment available for the universities, public infrastructure, public services and so on.  It is madness.  We are handing over control of science, innovation and the economy and, increasingly society, to a tiny group of multinational corporations who are ingenuous at making money and avoiding tax.<\/p><p>They are robbing other people's ideas and making money out of them.  Moreover, they want to take over our universities and hold them hostage.  Increasingly, they can because underfunded universities that do not get enough funding from the public have to go cap in hand to the private corporations begging for some money for research.  The companies say they can give it as long as the research benefits them.  That is what is going on.  There is a creeping corporate takeover of our third level institutions.  Some buildings in the third level institutions are named after billionaires in this country who in many cases became billionaires through aggressive tax avoidance.  There are buildings named after Michael Smurfit, Anthony O'Reilly, Denis O'Brien and so on.  Is this really what we want?  It is certainly not what I want.  I do not believe it is the basis of a sustainable economy.  Responsibility for the sort of technological advancement and investment in science that we want is being handed over to people who see only dollar signs or euro signs.  I absolutely believe we should reject this.<\/p> <p> We oppose this, full stop.  It is part of the race to the bottom.  Even in its own terms, which I have said we reject, how can the Government stop the big companies setting up small front companies and exploiting the system?  I do not believe it will be able to.<\/p> <p> What does the Government mean when it says &euro;7 million and &euro;50 million are small sums?  I could count on one hand &mdash; or probably on one finger in my constituency &mdash; the number of small enterprises that have an income of &euro;7 million or &euro;50 million in global profits.  That is not small.  Therefore, there is a sleight of hand.  It will benefit the same old gang, who are already ripping us off to an astronomical level.<\/p> <p> I do my best to ring the alarm bells about this stuff.  This is an important debate.  It will probably be ignored in the media narrative.  These are very serious issues that need to be discussed.  I do my best to ring a few alarm bells.

Beidh l&aacute; eile againn.  We can continue the debate elsewhere.  We had many a good debate over five years when we were in the Technical Group together.  It is very important that all views be heard.<\/p>  <p>  It is very timely that we have this debate on the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016.  The Finance Act 2015 introduced a knowledge development box, KDB.  One would think it was the KGB when listening to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He is not listening now.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag caint leis an Acting Chairman. The Bill brings in an effective reduced rate of corporation tax of 6.25% for qualifying income derived from qualifying expenditure in the European Union by an Irish tax resident company.  The KDB has been described as the first OECD-compliant KDB in the world, which means it is in line with international guidelines, the OECD Action 5 report, published on 5 October 2015, and specifically the OECD's modified nexus approach.  As I understand it, the KDB is a way for national governments to encourage the commercial exploitation of intellectual property by offering generous tax breaks on the profits derived from that intellectual property.  That is vital.<\/p>  <p>  While we have had the saga and mess of the Apple tax, in respect of which a judgment is awaited, I, as a Deputy representing Tipperary, acknowledge the amount of foreign direct investment in Clonmel and in Dungarvan and Waterford city in the neighbouring county, the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  We value this.  The companies have provided considerable employment.  They provide reasonably good and very good jobs but also have a spin-off effect on the services industry.  We have to nurture them and encourage them.  There is little point in having the ideologies of the hard left and harder left.  It is so hard now that kneecaps are nearly freezing.  This is in the belief that we are going to encourage the big companies to nurture smaller companies.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is hung up over the bigger companies setting up smaller companies to avail of the supports.  It is fine if they do.  From little acorns major trees grow.  We must support that.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on one area.  The &euro;7 million limit is very high for small indigenous companies or community enterprises we may like to or want to nurture.  In this regard, a turnover of &euro;7 is huge.  As I understand it, the KDB is a way for national governments to encourage the commercial exploitation of intellectual property by offering generous tax breaks on the profits derived from that intellectual property.  While it might not be perfect, this legislation is necessary and timely, as is the debate on it.  Intellectual property might be very limited and scarce at the outset.  We must remember the investment that must be made in any new patent, design or research and development.  Considerable work, time and energy goes into it also.  Therefore, we have to have a level playing field and a carrot-and-stick approach to encourage it.<\/p>  <p>  The patent box regime was first introduced in Ireland, in 2000, and has since been introduced in many EU member states, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy.  Is it not nice to think in these troubled times in our European Union, albeit with Great Britain threatening to exit, that we led the way in this regard?  Perhaps when the Minister of State Deputy Halligan and many other Ministers are lobbying their sister or brother Ministers throughout Europe, this might be one thing they will point to.  We have had innovative ideas that have replenished our own economy.  We have given ideas to other European states so they might nurture growth and take the baton or torch and run with it.<\/p>  <p>  Together with the existing 12.5% corporation tax rate, research and development tax credit and depreciation allowances for capital expenditure on intangibles, Ireland provides a hugely competitive offering to international business.  They would not be here otherwise.  We have to be competitive.  We cannot be so inward-looking and introverted that we bring down the barriers, especially with the onset of Brexit.  We must expand, explore, encourage, initiate and beg, steal or borrow in asking the companies to come here to avail of the supports available.  We must give the same kinds of supports to small indigenous businesses, SMEs and sole traders.  They will have difficulty getting funding because, as I have said, the limit is too high.  We cannot lose sight of this in these dark times as we try to come out of this recession.  We are being hit now with what is happening across the water and the associated reverberations throughout Europe and the world.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to US President Donald Trump as a maniac.  That language should not be used in any parliament.  Mr. Trump was elected as leader of the people of the most modern democracy in the world.  They elected him and they deal with him.  We should react only if he starts firing salvos at our people here or starts threatening to bring home companies that have been nurtured here, including with IDA grants.  I have used an analogy before about walking into a yard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, my colleague from Corcaigh who is present, Teachta Aindrias &Oacute; Muineach&aacute;in, and m&eacute; f&eacute;in go into a lot of houses and yards and meet dogs lying down.  We look to see whether they are cross or will bite.  I have been bitten three times during election campaigns.  One does not go over and kick the dog.  One slips in nicely and rings the bell.  The dog may be asleep or lazy, or he could be an old, tired dog, but you do not kick him until he bites you.<\/p><p>That silly narrative has grown in this Chamber, especially on the left.  People keep attacking because something does not suit their ideologies, liberal agendas and so on.<\/p> <p> Despite the obvious incentives, we should be clear - I mean this, regardless of my welcome - on at least some of the ethical issues surrounding intellectual property rights.  Discussing this issue is not the preserve of the AAA-PBP and the hard left.  We all have that right.  The ethical issues involved are evolving on an hourly basis.  We must be ever ready to examine, explore and engage on them.<\/p> <p> Professor J&oslash;rn S&oslash;nderholm has noted that intellectual property rights are a socioeconomic tool that create a temporary monopoly for inventor firms and enable them to charge prices for their innovations that are many times higher than the marginal cost of production.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned this matter frequently, although I did not hear other Deputies because I was at a meeting.  We all have those concerns.  Last night, I watched a video on Facebook of eight year old children who were working in mines.  Thank God for the power of Facebook and other such tools that allow us to see the exploitation of young people, the abuses, greed and naked slavery inflicted on people just to source and extract minerals out of the ground.  The same applies in sweat shops.  It is wholly unacceptable.  We all need to be educated on this situation, given that we all shop in the same places and buy the wares produced in those sweat shops.  We are all guilty, not only the Government and regulators, of turning a blind eye.  Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.<\/p> <p> The prices charged raise broader ethical issues surrounding intellectual property rights.  I was delighted that Deputy Eamon Ryan was able to remind Deputy Boyd Barrett that the models in question, despite not being in law, existed in Brehon times.  They are not new creations.  They were there fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.<\/p> <p> In line with much contemporary literature on the ethical dimensions of intellectual property rights, the product type in question that would give rise to most concern is life-saving medicine.  Indeed, I have just come from a Rural Independent Group meeting with a group of relatives of cystic fibrosis sufferers.  I also met them last week in the AV room.  I saw and listened to the horror and torture on their faces and in their voices as they read out letters from loved ones who had been dying.  One lady had the drug Orkambi with her.  She had a 14 year old.  She sent a picture around the room showing him playing sports, running and doing everything else that he inevitably would not be able to do.  Others had guilt about being alive when their siblings had passed away.  Those families have been living through mental torture, so to leave that meeting and then have to try to balance it with the intellectual property rights of drug companies is difficult.  How many companies did I mention were in Ireland?  Maybe the one making this drug is not.  How to balance its rights with the social good, life and death?  How could any Government delay and procrastinate?  People were given promises and we were all lobbied in the AV room last year.  They were told that it would be January, then early February.<\/p> <p> Not only the Government is involved, though.  The out-of-control HSE has also been procrastinating for a long time.  We met a group prior to that one regarding life-saving equipment on helicopters for rural areas.  The Irish Community Air Ambulance, comprising volunteer doctors and paramedics, found &euro;3.5 million from a donor to run the service for one year.  Hey presto, the HSE did not trust the group's bona fides.  This is the same HSE that will not perform due diligence or show enough compassion to consider these requests.<\/p> <p> These are the ethical issues that we must try to address.  They apply in the cases of life-saving medicines as well as other production types, but there is no comparison with a young child who is dying when drugs could save him or her.  The drug in question cost &euro;159,000 per year, but that is now down to &euro;129,000.  That murky big business has to continue after this debate, but the HSE has procrastinated so.  My colleague, Deputy Harty, spoke about the lack of governance and the desperate need for same.  The Taoiseach told us that the governance was fine, but it is not.  There is no governance.  The people who need these drugs are trying to survive.  Parents have needed to come to Leinster House tonight, last week and regularly when they should be at home with their sick loved ones.  It puts our passion and engagement in perspective when we debate these ethical concerns.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State give us any guarantee that, if the State offers generous terms to the development of intellectual property, issues such as this one will be addressed and form part of the broader conversation on the Knowledge Box Development (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016?  They must be.  The Minister of State has an important role, given his dealings with schools and wider education.  He has travelled half the world in recent times.  Deputy Boyd Barrett was critical of him - the Deputy had looked on the Minister of State as a bedfellow on the hard left for many years - and said that he would not be open to change.  The Minister of State will be open to change, though.  He has to be.  When one goes from this side of the House to that side, change occurs.  That change is difficult to handle.  I have never been on that side of the House, nor do I want to be, but the Minister of State must deal with the system, the Cabinet and the administration of the State, warts and all.  I have some appreciation of how difficult it is from our briefings with the Minister of State and the Ministers, Deputies Ross, Naughten and Zappone.<\/p> <p> The Bill and this debate are necessary.  The knowledge development box was introduced in the Finance Act 2015 as a tax incentive to encourage innovation and research and development.  Under the initiative, a corporate tax rate of 6.25% will apply to profits from intellectual property and assets that result from research and development carried out in Ireland.  Research and development work has never been more vital.  We must send out the message that we want more research and development and will give more grant aid to support the companies involved.  I know some young innovators who are finding it difficult to access that funding.<\/p> <p> The Finance Act provides that a number of distinct categories of intellectual property qualify for the knowledge development box - copyrighted software and patented inventions that share the characteristics of patents, in that they are novel, non-obvious and useful.  Everything designed is novel to the person designing it and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  The people involved might be intellectually able.  They have to be the thinkers, creators and thought provokers who can get their ideas out there, perhaps with others in companies.  This is why some of the larger companies might invest.  Deputy Boyd Barrett claimed that this would be bad, but it would not be.  People will have ideas and research them for years, but they are not bankers.  They do not have the accountants, design artists, specialties or qualifications necessary to bring their ideas that bit further.  We must encourage linkages and be available to help the person with the idea.  The man or woman who never made a mistake never made anything.  It is important that people, including young people, be encouraged.  I missed the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition this year, although I have attended it every other year.
