I want, again, to record my thanks to Mr Justice O'Higgins and his team for carrying out their task so expeditiously and for the thorough and thoughtful report.  It deserves the most careful consideration so that we can all do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to it in the first place. <\/p>  <p>  Using the wide range of statutory powers available to it, the Commission of Investigation has established, as definitively as it is possible to do, the facts surrounding the difficult matters it was asked to examine.  Inevitably, Mr Justice O'Higgins reaches a number of conclusions about the roles played by a number of persons in the events outlined in his report.  I hope all those affected can accept, as I do fully, that Mr Justice O'Higgins looked at the facts fairly and dispassionately and made every effort to do justice to the position of all.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever controversies might have surrounded some of the issues dealt with in the report we should not lose sight of one central and unpalatable fact: that victims were not best served by the Garda&iacute; in a number of these cases.  That is as unacceptable as it is disheartening and we must take all measures open to us to ensure that these shortcomings are not repeated.  It is victims who should be our central concern.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the events investigated by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Higgins go back almost a decade.  For my own part, I believe that it is abundantly clear that the system we had in place up to a couple of years ago to deal with reports of wrongdoing within the Garda&iacute; served no-one particularly well: not the people making the reports, not the people the subject of those reports, not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, above all, not the public.  This situation has been significantly transformed in a number of respects. In particular, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which was part of the previous Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers, provides a new mechanism for protected disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now, a Garda member may make a protected disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a statutorily independent body with a comprehensive range of powers available to it.

The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2016 is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the review of this case issued to the individual in question last December.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case and the person was informed of the reasons for that outcome.

There are good and sound reasons for that which the Deputy well appreciates.  I would remind the Deputy, nevertheless, that the case had been the subject of an earlier review by a senior counsel arising from which the then Minister decided against establishing any further inquiry.

The cases were all considered by independent counsel, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.<\/p>  <p>  Following their reviews of the papers in each case, counsel made recommendations to me as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  In many cases the outcome was there was no further action which should or indeed which could be taken by me as Minister.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that all complainants received an accurate account of the process, I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of individual letters notifying each person of the outcome of the review in their particular case.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. <\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already stated, I appreciate that some complainants will be disappointed or unhappy with the outcome but the review was independent and came to its own conclusions in all cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700051#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Assets Bureau","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700051#WRA04150"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[10144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700051#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to roll out a locally organised Criminal Assets Bureau as piloted in Store Street in Dublin 2 in February 2016; and if expanding and fast-tracking this process will be an important step in targeting the unexplained wealth of middle and lower level drug dealers and protecting public safety in the areas affected most by criminality, given the recent spate in gangland violence.","asker":"1291","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy's question to refer to the work of the Divisional Assets Profiling Unit at Store Street.<\/p>  <p>  To avoid any misconception, I should however clarify that the Divisional Assets Profiling Unit at Store Street is not a locally organised Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  To achieve nationwide coverage, the Criminal Assets Bureau has for some considerable time maintained a link with each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Under this Programme asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime.

These Regulations provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014.  The Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistle blowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is prescribed as a body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.

I want, again, to record my thanks to Mr Justice O'Higgins and his team for carrying out their task so expeditiously and for the thorough and thoughtful report.  It deserves the most careful consideration so that we can all do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to it in the first place. <\/p>  <p>  Using the wide range of statutory powers available to it, the Commission of Investigation has established, as definitively as it is possible to do, the facts surrounding the difficult matters it was asked to examine.  Inevitably, Mr Justice O'Higgins reaches a number of conclusions about the roles played by a number of persons in the events outlined in his report.  I hope all those affected can accept, as I do fully, that Mr Justice O'Higgins looked at the facts fairly and dispassionately and made every effort to do justice to the position of all. <\/p>  <p>  Whatever controversies might have surrounded some of the issues dealt with in the report we should not lose sight of one central and unpalatable fact: that victims were not best served by the Garda&iacute; in a number of these cases.  That is as unacceptable as it is disheartening and we must take all measures open to us to ensure that these shortcomings are not repeated.  It is victims who should be our central concern.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the events investigated by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Higgins go back almost a decade.  For my own part, I believe that it is abundantly clear that the system we had in place up to a couple of years ago to deal with reports of wrongdoing within the Garda&iacute; served no-one particularly well: not the people making the reports, not the people the subject of those reports, not the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, above all, not the public.  This situation has been significantly transformed in a number of respects.  In particular, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which was part of the previous Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers, provides a new mechanism for protected disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now, a Garda member may make a protected disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a statutorily independent body with a comprehensive range of powers available to it.  The Ombudsman Commission may, if it believes it is in the public interest to do so, investigate such a complaint.  The Act also provides Garda&iacute; who make protected disclosures with all the protections set out in the Act, including protection from dismissal and protection from penalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, there has been an unprecedented programme of Garda reform which, having had the honour of being reappointed as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am determined to continue to progress.<\/p>  <p>  For all those changes which have taken place or are underway, it is important that we look specifically at what the report by Mr Justice O'Higgins has to say.  In this regard, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the report and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent a recurrence of the particular issues dealt with in the report.<\/p>  <p>  I have also forwarded a copy of the report to the Policing Authority in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that the events outlined in the report have been traumatic for many people who have been affected by them.  It would be an injustice to those who brought events to light in the public interest and those who have lived under the shadow of these events for a long time, if we do not take on board the lessons from these events.  I hope they can take some reassurance from the fact that the examination of those events in this report will help serve to consolidate a programme of reform which will ensure we continue to have a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which its members and the community it serves can take great pride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[10133\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has implemented each of the 173 recommendations of the Mc Mahon report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, has implications for a number of Government Departments and services.<\/p>  <p>  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.

The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.

management in relation to these serious matters, and were briefed on the significant progress being made in investigations into recent organised crime related murders in the Dublin region.  The Deputy will appreciate that as these appalling crimes are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations it would not be appropriate for me to make any more detailed comment at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly it would not be appropriate to engage in detailed discussion on the composition of particular criminal networks.  However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully monitor the activities of the criminal groups referred to and those associated with them and are implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks.<\/p>  <p>  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in the past successfully faced-down criminal gangs who believed they were above the law.  I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to confront and oppose the violent thugs who seek to perpetrate such heinous crimes in our State. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang related crime in the Dublin area, with a special allocation of &euro;5 million to support concentrated policing measures, including steps to establish a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) in the Dublin area.  The Dublin ASU is in the process of being set up and trained.  However, it must be clearly understood that pending the full establishment of the new unit arrangements have been put in place so that the necessary armed support is being provided on an overtime basis.  I am being kept up to date on this work and I can assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Unit, including all of the necessary training and preparatory arrangements, is being progressed as a matter of priority.  The Garda response includes highly visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints and targeted and intelligence based operations, to disrupt and prevent incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  I should add that, contrary to suggestions made in some quarters, there has been no diminution in these operations in recent weeks and the Garda authorities have assured me that the opposite is in fact the case.  The Garda response includes highly  visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints, and targeted and intelligence based operations, with a view to disrupting and preventing incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the new Programme for Government we are pressing forward with an accelerated programme of Garda recruitment with a view to achieving a Force of 15,000 members.  This is a central element of the Government's anti-crime strategy and we have already made provision for the recruitment of 1,150 new Gardai since we reopened the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  I might add that the Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that Garda specialist units, such as the armed units which respond to gang-related violence, are enabled to operate at full strength.<\/p>  <p>  The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang,  in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, has arisen from time to time.  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  I am advised that relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  We already have in place a wide range of strong legislation to deal with gangland activities, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that all legislation in this area is kept under review and I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that our laws and policing strategies respond as effectively as possible to evolving crime trends. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[10006\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each station in west County Cork on 31 March 2011 and on 31 March 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

In addition we have seen the introduction of landmark legislation in recent years in the field of forensic investigation.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 facilitated the establishment of a new DNA database which has the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes and will greatly assist the Garda&iacute; in the investigation of a range of serious offences.

I would again make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of the process so I do not propose to discuss individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC as a prescribed body, and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act. <\/p>  <p>  The protections available to whistleblowers under the 2007 Regulations continue to be afforded to whistleblowers under the 2014 Act.  The confidentiality provisions also apply and so the identity of whistleblowers is not made known to me or my Department by GSOC. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously advised the House in relation to these particular cases, I have no function in relation to criminal investigations and the submission of files to the DPP, or in relation to the investigation of complaints by GSOC.  Those bodies are independent in carrying out their statutory functions and I know that neither the Deputy nor anyone in this House would suggest that I should have any power to interfere with that independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB05550"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[10047\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700052#WRB05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the net increase in the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Dublin metropolitan region southern and eastern divisions that will accrue from the recruitment campaign in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts.

In the case of refugee resettlement some of those included are not of Syrian nationality but were persons in Syria and displaced on account of the ongoing conflict there and have been included on that basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the EU resettlement initiative, in 2015 a total of 176 refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict were admitted from Jordan and from Lebanon.  The nationalities were Syrian, Iraqis that were refugees in Syria, Syrian Iraqis and Syrian Palestinians.  This year a further 100 Syrians have been admitted from Lebanon with 10 more due to arrive on Tuesday 17th May and additional numbers are expected later this year.  These numbers are part of the overall commitment of the Government to take a total of 520 refugees under this EU initiative.   In addition, under the National Resettlement Programme, in 2013 a total of 36 refugees were admitted of which 31 Afghan refugees were admitted from Damascus and 5 Palestinians were admitted from Syria as a medical case. The Afghans were refugees in Syria and were displaced once again by the Syrian conflict  and were admitted under an EU funded project.  In 2014 a further 89 refugees, displaced by the Syrian conflict, were admitted from Jordan.<\/p>  <p>  Under the EU Relocation Programme, Ireland is committed to taking over 2,500 persons seeking asylum in Greece and Italy to have their applications for asylum processed in Ireland.  It is expected that many of the overall total will be Syrian nationals.  A total of 10 Syrians have arrived to-date from Greece with a further 31 Syrians expected to arrive in the coming weeks.  A pledge for a further 40 has been submitted to Greece and is being progressed.   A pledge of 20 was also made to Italy by Ireland, however, some procedural issues require to be resolved before these can proceed.   <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the position is that Ireland remains committed to the pledges it has made.  While the initial pace of implementation has been slow due to operational issues in Greece and Italy, numbers are expected to increase significantly in the coming months as these issues are resolved.  <\/p>  <p>  The Syrian Humanitarian Admissions Programme (SHAP) was introduced in March 2014 and closed April 2014.  This programme allowed naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already lawfully residing in the State, to apply for vulnerable close family members, present in Syria or who have fled from Syria to surrounding countries since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011 to join them here on a temporary basis for up to two years.  Those admitted under the Programme are entitled to work, establish a business, or invest in the State.  A key condition of the SHAP is that these persons should not become a burden on the state.  A total of 44 applications involving 119 beneficiaries were approved . <\/p>  <p>  Overall, there were a total of 446 Syrian nationals registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau at the end of 2015.  The number legally resident here would be higher as persons under the age of 16 are not required to register.  This figure would also exclude persons who have applied for asylum or subsidiary protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Amendments","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[10164\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the Minister responsible for setting up the citizens' assembly relating to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution; how representatives and members of the assembly will be selected; when this process will begin, if it will be given a definitive time frame to conclude its deliberations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, in the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government has committed to establishing a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, within six months and without participation by politicians, with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues over an extended time period.

It also proposes that a referendum be held on Article 41.2.1&deg; regarding a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s life within the home&rdquo;, an issue considered by the Convention in its Second Report.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also states that the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, on economic, social and cultural rights, will be referred to the new Oireachtas Committee on Housing for consideration of the substantial questions it raises on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Fifth Report on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections, the last Government had indicated that it was necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before a decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  <\/p>  <p>  That analysis is ongoing and will be considered by Government in due course.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the recommendations relating to D&aacute;il Reform contained in the Convention's Seventh Report, Standing Orders were amended in January to provide for election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot. This occurred on the first sitting day of the new D&aacute;il on 10 March. Standing Orders were also amended to introduce a system whereby the Taoiseach will appear before the Working Group of Committee Chairs twice a year.  Provision has also been made by Standing Orders for the proportionate allocation of Committee chairs using the d&rsquo;Hondt system.<\/p>  <p>  As all of the Convention&rsquo;s Reports have been responded to and actions taken as summarised above, it is not proposed that the Reports be brought before the new D&aacute;il or a new Convention. The Deputy will however be aware that the new Government has committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the establishment of a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, within six months and without participation by politicians, with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues over an extended time period. <\/p>  <p>  These issues will not be limited to those directly pertaining to the Constitution and may include issues such as, for example, how we, as a nation, best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly will also be asked to make recommendations to the D&aacute;il on further constitutional changes, including on the Eighth Amendment, on fixed term parliaments and on the manner in which referenda are held (e.g. should &lsquo;super referendum days&rsquo;, whereby a significant number of referenda take place on the same day, be held).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[9830\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fixed penalty notices issued to cyclists since the commencement of the Road Traffic Act 2015 by the alleged offences for which these penalties were issued.","asker":"1274","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the enforcement of road traffic legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Authority currently has some 23 staff, however with provision of an increased budget in 2016 this number will increase to 36 in the coming months.  The key areas of work of the Regulator include registration and award of charitable status, annual reporting, compliance and investigations, charity services (formerly under the Office of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests) and providing a public register and statistical information on the charity sector.<\/p>  <p>  The deadline for organisations to apply for charitable status was 16 April 2016 and a significant spike in applications were received. The Regulator is currently processing over 4,500 applications of which 3,600 are from schools through a bulk registration system.  Applications are currently being processed by a team of 7 staff of which 3 are case officers who are responsible for making decisions to award charitable status.  Additional staffing will, however, provide for a doubling of case officers dealing with registration.  Processing times for charitable status is currently 6 to 9 months.  This is partly due to the fact that since many organisations are engaging in the registration process for the first time, a significant number of applications are incomplete and must be queried for additional information.  However the Regulator assures me that this processing time will reduce quickly.  The immediate priority will be to process new organisation applications (i.e. applications in respect of new charities established after 16 October 2014) as such organisations are significantly constrained in their operations prior to any decision by the Regulator to award charitable status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Reform","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9538\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to review the circumstances and policies surrounding the allocation of free legal aid; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, that is, civil legal aid and criminal legal aid.  Details in respect of each category are outlined below. <\/p><p><b>Criminal Legal Aid<\/b><\/p><p>Under the current legislation, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  The courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  As the judiciary are independent in the exercise of their functions,  I have no role in these matters.<\/p><p>It must established to the satisfaction of the court that an individual's means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  <\/p><p>New Criminal Legal Aid legislation is currently being prepared to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid, including transferring responsibility for its administration to the Legal Aid Board.  The proposed measures include provisions to enable the Board to investigate the means of a person to whom legal aid was granted and, where it is determined that the person can afford to pay the costs or a portion of the costs, to direct that person to pay the amount calculated as being owed.  Other measures include powers to revoke the criminal legal aid certificate and sanctions for providing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.<\/p><p><b>Civil Legal Aid<\/b><\/p><p>The Legal Aid Board administers the civil legal aid scheme on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (as amended) and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations (1996 &ndash; 2013). The criteria for obtaining legal advice are set out in section 26 of the Act while the criteria for obtaining legal aid are set out in section 28. Both sections require that an applicant satisfy certain financial eligibility conditions, and the detail of these conditions is set out in the aforementioned Regulations. The Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically it brings proposals to my Department. As an example, at the moment I am looking at amending the Regulations in order to enable persons at risk of losing their homes on account of mortgage arrears to get access to a solicitor on a legally aided basis at no cost and without reference to the normal financial eligibility criteria that apply.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04350"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[9532\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700053#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of reservists who have applied and who have been accepted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the inception of the recruitment process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This Operation represents a carefully considered strategy which was developed after I initiated a broad review of our approach to burglary crime in the early part of last year and is now supporting a concerted drive against those involved in burglary crime, including the highly mobile criminal gangs who have targeted communities in Kildare and many other areas.  The concentrated Garda activity under Operation Thor has included more than 19,000 anti-crime patrols and in the order of 23,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 1,300 arrests covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.<\/p><p>  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.<\/p><p> The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:<\/p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;<\/p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;<\/p><p>- Make work pay;<\/p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;<\/p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support;<\/p><p>- Engage employers.<\/p><p>Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental cooperation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.  The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.  It is the Government's intention to implement the Strategy in full. The key implementation issues relate to coordinating Departmental efforts in this area, rather than to additional funds.  <\/p><p>  Responsibility for the fund referred to rests with the Department of Social Protection.  The Strategy provides for the incorporation of learning from relevant Disability Activation (DACT) projects that operated under the previous European Social Fund Operational Programme, to be used to inform policy development.  I am informed by that Department that an interdepartmental working group was established in October 2015 to examine the findings of the evaluation of the DACT project report and to identify the next steps.

The Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation including through more effective targeting of acts of child sexual grooming.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments and implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. <\/p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in January 2016.  Enactment of this important piece of legislation is a priority for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputies' attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700054#WRD06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700054#WRD06950"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[9953\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700054#WRD07000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1359","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[9954\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700054#WRD07100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to support a matter (details supplied) regarding anti-social behaviour; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1359","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the concerns which can arise in relation to the impact of various types of anti-social behaviour on householders and local communities.

To further support the establishment of such local initiatives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published Community Crime Prevention Guidelines as well as guidelines for local Text Alert Groups.  The Garda Text Alert Scheme is a particularly successful example of Community Policing in action with over 700 local groups in operation, involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.

Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.

This arises due to the limitation on allowable contributions imposed by the age-related percentage limits and overall income cap provided for in subsection 774(7)(c) and section 790A of the Act.  Where a person is unable to claim the relief for all of their pension contributions in the year of contribution due to the aforementioned limitation, any unclaimed amount may be carried forward to a subsequent year or years.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that given the scope of the first question, they are not in a position to provide the information in the time available.

The Deputies will be aware that mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a change I introduced in Budget 2012, first time buyers who bought at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008 receive a rate of mortgage interest relief of 30%. This 30% rate will continue to be applicable to these first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief is scheduled to\u00a0be available, i.e. currently up to the end of 2017. In the absence of this change the mortgage interest relief available would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%.<\/p>  <p>  Single individuals and married couples\/civil partners that are first-time buyers qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively.

It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner. In addition, as the amount of\u00a0interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that, in the Programme for Partnership Government, there is a commitment to retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date of December 2017 on a tapered basis.

Furthermore, over the remainder of the forecast horizon out to 2021, potential growth rates are forecast to average around 3.5\u00a0per cent per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has broadened with growth now increasingly driven by domestic factors. This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the external sector remains strong with exports increasing by 13.8 per cent in 2015. The competitiveness gains achieved since 2008 have been the result of productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that these gains are maintained, to support continued growth through both foreign direct and indigenous investment.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now seen thirteen successive quarters of employment growth. In 2015, employment increased by 2.6% - representing an additional 50,000 jobs. As a result, the latest data show the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.4 per cent at the end of April, the lowest level since 2008. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0SPU recognises that there are nevertheless several sources of uncertainty at present. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the continuing economic slowdown of several Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and the effect this will have on the global economy. Additionally with the forthcoming referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union on the horizon, Ireland is potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit.<\/p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can continue to be made in the years ahead. However, this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices.

Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include, inter alia, capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt.<\/p><p>In 2013 non-public institution-specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.  The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans.  The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out.  Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory. <\/p><p>Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including, inter alia, the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability.  The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond.  Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.<\/p><p>In relation to homeowners in financial difficulties, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.

It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  It sets out a process, called \u00a0the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The MARP is a four-step process which lenders must follow:<\/p><p>Step 1:\u00a0 Communicate with the borrower<\/p><p>Step 2:\u00a0 Gather financial information<\/p><p>Step 3:\u00a0 Assess the borrower's circumstances<\/p><p>Step 4:\u00a0 Propose a resolution<\/p><p>The CCMA also requires lenders to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower appeal a decision by a lender, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.  The appeals procedure must inform the borrower of his\/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The CCMA also provides that, at the borrower's request and with the borrower's\u00a0written consent,\u00a0the lender must liai se\u00a0with a third party to act on his\/her behalf in relation to his\/her arrears situation. \u00a0<\/p><p>On 18 December 2015, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48)(Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 were published.

","asker":"1366","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>I am advised that the 2012 report of the interdepartmental group (chaired by Dr Don Thornhill) on the design of a Local Property Tax (LPT) considered the issue of introducing an exemption or waiver for those below a certain income threshold.  However, the report concluded that income-related waivers are an inefficient and costly method of targeting relief as they run the risk of creating inequities between property owners in broadly comparable financial situations.  As noted in the group's report, there would also be substantial administrative difficulties in determining exactly which categories of property owners should qualify for an income based exemption or waiver.<\/p>  <p>  Instead it was decided to implement a system of deferral of LPT for persons below a certain income threshold.  There are number of criteria that must be met to qualify for such a deferral but in the main the income of the individual must be below &euro;15,000 for a full deferral and below &euro;25,000 for a partial deferral (&euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 thresholds apply for couples).  It should be noted that the deferral option attaches as a charge on the property until paid and also carries an annual interest charge of 4%.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that approximately 29,000 property owners availed of this deferral in respect of 2015 liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The thresholds applicable for the income deferral were recommended by the Thornhill interdepartmental group report based on analysis by the ESRI.  These were considered appropriate, having regard to potential impacts on households and to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes and the levels of social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible at present to accurately estimate the cost of replacing the deferral with an exemption for all property owners with income below &euro;14,000.  This is due to the wide ranging nature of property owners with low incomes.  Some will be in employment or self-employment (and paying Income Tax), others will be individuals or businesses with no net liability to tax (and therefore not filing detailed tax returns with Revenue) and there will be a significant cohort of individuals, about whom Revenue data are very limited, for example property owners in receipt of only social welfare payments.  There may also be foreign owners of Irish property for which income data are not available.  Because complete information on the incomes of certain groups of property owners is not available to Revenue, the cost of an exemption for owners with incomes below &euro;14,000 cannot be estimated at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH02450"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[10353\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of abolishing the 4% interest rate for those who choose to defer payment of the property tax under the current system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This table displays the estimated cost, in terms of revenue foregone, as well as the numbers who availed of the main tax credits and reliefs, including tax relief on medical insurance premiums.  The table contains information from\u00a02004 to 2013, the latest year for which full information is currently available.  Provisional data indicate an estimated cost for tax relief on medical insurance premiums of &euro;354 million and &euro;325 million in 2014 and 2015 respectively.Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are not currently available.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the medical insurance tax relief costs in the Tax Expenditures Table include, where relevant, the cost to the Exchequer of age-related relief at source, which was established by the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The cost of the age related tax credit for years 2009 to 2012 inclusive is offset by a stamp duty on health insurance policies.<\/p><p>The age related tax credit and stamp duty were part of an interim scheme of risk equalisation, which was introduced in order to provide direct support to community rating in the private health insurance market and is intended to be revenue neutral over its duration.  This interim scheme expired on 31 December 2012 and was replaced from 1 January 2013 by a permanent risk equalisation scheme, provided for in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012. Risk equalisation credits are not given through the tax system effective from 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>Since 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost.  Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. <\/p><p>The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance increased significantly in the years leading up to the introduction of the caps in Budget 2014, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011 and &euro;448 million in 2012 (excluding the age related tax credit).  Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured were estimated to have reduced by approximately 150,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover decreased on some policies.  Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable.  If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, it was estimated that the cost of the uncapped relief would have increased to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.<\/p><p>In my view, taking into account the increasing costs and reducing coverage outlined above, it was unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population had contributed so much to repairing the public finances.  The ceilings ensure a level of continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the returns filed with Revenue do not include information that would allow an income distribution of the beneficiaries of this tax relief to be provided.  Accordingly, the specific information requested\u00a0as to the income brackets of individuals claiming tax relief on private health insurance premiums is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH03150"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[10362\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700058#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be gained through the introduction of a sugary drinks tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>The introduction of a health levy on sugar-sweetened drinks has been included in the Programme for a Partnership Government.

His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.  In my Budget 2016 statement,\u00a0I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gave sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers\u00a011 and\u00a012 respectively).\u00a0\u00a0My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.

This is evidenced by the fact, for example, that in 2015 timely payment and return compliance ranged from 85% for the smallest cases to 98% for the largest cases.  Timely compliance for Local Property Tax was 97%.<\/p>  <p>  I know that Revenue has a strong focus on service as a very important underpinning in helping taxpayers and businesses to be timely and voluntarily compliant.  The recently published Revenue Annual Report, 2015 set out the range of actions undertaken by them in that regard and I commend that approach by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  In an ideal world everyone would be timely compliant but of course the reality is a little different.  Despite the high timely compliance rates, I know that Revenue has a keen focus on tackling non-compliance in all its guises and in ensuring that the efforts of those who are timely compliant are not undermined by those who choose to be non-complaint and engage in tax evasion.  I am aware that Revenue has a particular risk focus to its compliance intervention programmes.  Risk-assessment techniques and systems identify and rank suspect or risky cases and this information is presented to caseworkers and auditors so that the appropriate intervention is actioned.  Compliance interventions range from a simple phone contact to audit to criminal prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the impact of its non-compliance focus, I am advised by Revenue that, for example, its audit and compliance interventions in 2015 yielded &euro;642.5m. 28 criminal convictions for serious tax and duty evasion were also secured in 2015. 160 tax avoidance cases were settled during the year netting &euro;42m for the Exchequer.  Drugs and tobacco seizures valued at &euro;23.1m and &euro;34.4m respectively were realised.<\/p>  <p>  Opportunities to increase tax revenue were identified by Revenue in their Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 20014, published on their website. As part of the 2016 Estimates process Revenue sought to increase its staff resource to confront non-compliance by 50 whole time equivalents in order to increase the tax and duty yield from compliance interventions.  This followed on from a net increase in the 2015 Estimate process of 126.  Following the 2016 Estimates process, I am very pleased to be able to say that Revenue's multi-annual budget was increased to provide for an average annual whole time staff equivalent of 5,924, an increase of 50 on the 2015 provision.  An additional &euro;75m yield from compliance interventions was included in Budget 2016 calculations based on the recruitment of additional staff and investment in the development of a new debt analysis tool.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue's objective of making taxes and duties easy to pay and hard to avoid is a very important one.  It is an objective in which it is succeeding.  An appropriately resourced tax and customs administration is essential in ensuring that we continue to experience high timely compliance and that non-compliance and tax evasion is appropriately sanctioned.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last two year's Estimates process I have supported the business case by Revenue to increase its staffing levels by a total of 176 staff.  This follows on from the overall reduction in Revenue and Civil Service numbers since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  I am also informed by Revenue that ongoing investment in Information Communications Technology (ICT) is critical to ensure that Revenue provides a modern service to the compliant but also better targets non-compliance in all its forms.  Revenue's policy throughout the economic crisis was to maintain investment in ICT to the greatest extent possible given the difficult budgetary circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the 2017 Estimates process I will carefully consider any proposals that Revenue make in relation to resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700059#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700059#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[10651\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700059#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is pursuing the retrospective recapitalisation of the banking sector; his plans for disposal of bank assets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":651,"content":"<p>As I\u00a0have said previously I see no benefit in making an application for retrospective use of the ESM's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI).  During the period between June 2012, when the agreement was reached regarding retrospective recapitalisation, and December 2014, when the DRI tool became operational, the Irish economy recovered significantly and the options available for the State to recover its money invested in the banks expanded.  This remains the case, with investors now willing to support Irish banks, the institutions have begun to repay capital to the State and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The terms and conditions attaching to the use of the DRI instrument are extremely onerous as the instrument is designed to be used almost as a last resort after the creditor waterfall has been applied and other options are exhausted.  Moreover the likely mechanics behind a potential retroactive application of the instrument, if such a decision could be agreed, are likely to be equally if not more onerous in my view, and would not be in the best interests of the State.<\/p>  <p>  As you will be aware the operational framework of the ESM DRI includes stringent conditionality and any application would need to be unanimous amongst the other eighteen ESM Governors.  Achieving such an outcome for a deal which valued our investments at a level significantly above what we might achieve in the market today\u00a0is extremely unlikely, particularly\u00a0given the strength of our economic recovery since 2012 and the other concessions won by Ireland in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The disposal of our bank assets is a process that will likely take place over a number of years and this is incorporated\u00a0in the Programme for Government.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.<\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants. An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700060#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700060#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[9620\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700060#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the status of a school project (details supplied); to meet the board of management to finalise plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school in question has a major building project included in my Department's 6 Year Capital Programme, due to go to construction in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the school concerned submitted a proposal through its Patron to relocate the school within the Portlaoise area to meet its long term accommodation needs.

School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader. The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.<\/p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>In addition, the NCSE has established over 150 new Special Classes in the 2015\/16 school year, which means there are now over 1,000 special classes attached to mainstream schools catering for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>There is an extra 480 Resource Teachers in our schools in the current school year which takes into account increased demand and demographic growth and ensures that children continue to have access to additional supports in school. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory role under the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act to provide me with policy advice in relation to matters concerning the education of persons with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The NCSE published policy advice in 2013 which identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable and recommended the development of a new allocation model. <\/p><p>In developing its policy advice the NCSE consulted widely with education partners, representatives from the school sector, parents, and disability representative bodies.<\/p><p>The NCSE recommended that a new model be developed based on the profiled needs of each school, including consideration of Standardised Test performances in schools, and a school's social context, rather than primarily on school size and the diagnosed disability of individual children. It is intended that this new model will reduce the inequities in the current system, and also ensure that we are not unnecessarily labelling children from a young age in order to access resources. <\/p><p>Although there was widespread support for the implementation of the new model, there was not time to address all of the issues in relation to the proposed new model in time to allow for it to be implemented this year. A pilot of the new model, which is currently underway in 47 schools, will run for the duration of the current school year. This pilot has been developed in order to test the model in a number of schools and to allow for the practical effect of the application of the new model in pilot schools to be gauged.  It will also allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot, prior to the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":833,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL04400"},{"type":"question","counter":834,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[10118\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is aware that a person (details supplied) is being refused a reader for the leaving certificate examination in June 2016, despite having had a reader for the junior certificate; and to reverse this decision.","asker":"1280","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":835,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations in the Certificate Examinations.

Following the review the SEC will develop proposals and plans for any changes to the RACE Scheme it considers necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the SEC operates a Scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at the Leaving and Junior Certificate examinations for candidates with special needs in the examinations. The Scheme applies to candidates who have a physical or medical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty. All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published Framework of Principles established by an Expert Advisory Group. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations are not intended to compensate for a possible lack of achievement arising from a disability or to compensate for difficulties arising from a candidate's general intellectual functioning.  Reasonable accommodations are intended to:<\/p>  <p>  (a) to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment and<\/p>  <p>  (b) to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination. The range of accommodations includes, inter alia, provision of modified, brailled and enlarged papers for visually impaired students; access to readers, scribes, word-processor, tape or voice recorder for student with physical conditions or dyslexia or other types of SLD; exemptions from components of the examinations such as the oral or aural or the waiver from spelling and grammar in language subjects. Some students may apply for and be granted more than one type of accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where a school\/parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of the SEC's decision, they have access to an Independent Appeals Committee. All members of the Appeals Committee are drawn from outside the SEC. The remit of the Appeals Committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the SEC.

This special provision means that unlike the generality of schools, in the event that a reduction in the pupil numbers of an island school will result in the loss of the second or third classroom teaching post in the school, the post may be retained subject to certain pupil retention levels. <\/p><p>In the case of the second mainstream post the total number of pupils must be at 8 or above and the school must be the only primary school remaining on the island.  In the case of the third mainstream post, the enrolment threshold is 45 for the only primary school on the island.<\/p><p>The staffing arrangements for the current school year provide an improvement to the staffing levels of small schools. Improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one teacher schools were introduced for the 2015\/16 school year.

However, unlike other subject areas, the content of the religious curriculum provided by schools is not set by my Department. The Education Act recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This means that the content of the religious education programme in a particular primary school is determined by the patron of the school.<\/p>  <p>  This is similar to post primary level, where a programme of religious instruction approved by the school patron may be offered. However, post primary schools also have the option of using the Religious Education curriculum which has been designed as an examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The NCCA syllabuses are academic in nature. They are concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and are designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none. A new specification for Junior Cycle Religious Education will be introduced for first year students from September 2019 and assessed in 2022 for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Constitution and in accordance with the Education Act 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they wish.  The practical arrangements to accommodate children whose parents have chosen this option is a matter for each individual school to arrange locally. As part of the programme for government is a commitment to publish a new school Admissions and Excellence legislation taking account current draft proposals, which included a provision for schools to indicate in their enrolment policies how they would facilitate requests to opt out of religious instruction.<\/p>  <p>  You should also note that in January of this year Rule 68 of the Rules for National Schools was rescinded. The Rule, which dates from 1965 refers to religious instruction as by far the most important part of the school curriculum and provides that a religious spirit should \"inform and vivify the whole work of the school.\"  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the reference to Community National Schools (CNS), I can advise that CNS are multi-denominational schools which welcome children of all faiths and none. A multi-belief Religious Education programme entitled Goodness Me! Goodness You! (GMGY) provides for the delivery of religious education and faith nurturing in the CNSs. GMGY caters for children of all faith and belief perspectives, with content appropriate for both theist and non-theist perspectives.  The GMGY core programme is taught to all children in one group irrespective of their belief. For three to four weeks each year, during the two and a half hours per week allocated for religious education, faith and belief-specific teaching is provided to children whose parents have opted for them to receive such teaching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL08700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL08800"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[10302\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700061#WRL08900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to diversify patronage arrangements in order that it is easier for schools to change patrons while continuing to increase the number of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to progressing the patronage divesting process to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, as well as ensuring that parental preferences are key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.<\/p>  <p>  Mission of Technological Universities: These institutions will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes -<\/p>  <p>   &ndash; a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world, <\/p>  <p>  - the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and<\/p>  <p>  - the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.<\/p>  <p>  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society. <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities. These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.<\/p>  <p>  The mission and vision for each proposed technological university is developed by the consortia, in consultation with stakeholders including staff and students, and is contained in the implementation plans subsequently developed.<\/p>  <p>  Consortiums who have applied:As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. <\/p>  <p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - an expression of interest, <\/p>  <p>  - the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria, <\/p>  <p>  - an evaluation of the plan, and <\/p>  <p>  - an application for designation.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). <\/p>  <p>  Status of Consortia:At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process. These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university. This application was approved to proceed to the next stage.  In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.    As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this both Institutions made a joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority last week, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.  This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent. <\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants. An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700062#WRM05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Reviews","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700062#WRM05700"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[10585\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700062#WRM05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number and percentage of teachers who have fully engaged in training for the new junior cycle curriculum and assessment; the number of schools that are not currently in a position to implement the new junior cycle English classroom assessment due to the ban by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland on teacher participation; and the number of students who will not be able to participate in the classroom-based assessment if the ban continues.","asker":"1244","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>Continuing professional development for Junior Cycle is given by the dedicated Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) team which is funded by my Department.  <\/p><p>As an initial step in the Junior Cycle CPD process, schools are requested to register their teachers with JCT in the relevant subject area.

I am satisfied that the process followed was compliant with all relevant environmental obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Eligibility","counter":1017,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07000"},{"type":"question","counter":1018,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[9422\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to amend existing eligibility requirements concerning income which is considered assessable for the purposes of the incremental tenant purchase scheme for local authority housing, in order to allow for the inclusion of additional social protection and assistance payments; if he is aware that a large number of tenants are prevented from accessing the scheme by the exclusion of these payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[9423\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if applicants will only be deemed eligible under the incremental tenant purchase scheme for local authority housing when they have paid all liabilities in respect of water charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[9644\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"why carer's allowance is not recognised as income under the new tenant purchase scheme 2016, as it is not included in determining a tenant's gross income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1021,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[9699\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the requirement by Donegal County Council to have the payment of water charges as a condition for the tenant purchase scheme; if he agrees with this requirement, given there is no requirement for the payment of other utility bills by the tenant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[10062\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"why persons with adequate savings are ineligible to apply under the tenant purchase scheme for local authority houses if they are on a low income or if all their income derives from social protection payments; if he will amend this regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1023,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[10254\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to consider a case (details supplied) regarding the purchase of a property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1024,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362, 363, 376, 382, 397 and 404 together.  <\/p><p>Provision was made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 for a new Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme for existing local authority houses.  Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum. <\/p><p>The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to tenant income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved. <\/p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.<\/p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them. <\/p><p>A number of income sources, including carer&rsquo;s allowance and certain other social welfare payments, are disregarded for the purposes of determining reckonable income.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership and responsibility of the house from the local authority to the tenant. <\/p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  In order to participate in the scheme, the tenant must, in the first instance, meet the eligibility criteria as set out in the relevant legislation, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination of, own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. <\/p><p>Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which commenced on 1 January 2016, inserts a new section 3A into the Water Services Act 2014, subsection (9) of which provides that a housing authority shall not complete the sale of a dwelling under a tenant purchase scheme until the tenant provides to the authority a certificate from Irish Water confirming that any charge under section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in respect of that dwelling payable by the tenant has been paid.  Therefore, tenants of local authority houses who wish to participate in the scheme must provide the relevant certificate from Irish Water, in order for the sale of the house to be completed. <\/p><p>The consideration of individual applications and the determination of eligibility under the new Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 2014 Act and the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015.<\/p><p>The new scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring its operation in consultation with housing authorities.  In line with the commitment in the new Programme for a Partnership Government<i><\/i>to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation and to bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07800"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[9387\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN07900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of social housing units to be built in 2016, by county and city borough; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government has undertaken to<b><\/b>significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing units, the targets for which are set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  The Strategy has targeted the provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households, mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment.  Social housing targets have previously been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, along with the associated provisional funding allocations, at the following link:<i><\/i><i> <\/i><\/p><p>A key objective under the Social Housing Strategy and in the Programme for a Partnership Government is to increase social housing output in the immediate, medium and longer term.  To meet this objective, it is necessary to avail of a mixture of delivery mechanisms.  In the immediate term, the acquisition of homes and the refurbishment of vacant local authority dwellings offer quick solutions to accommodate households on the waiting list.  Leasing and renting also offer much needed immediate supply. <\/p><p>Over 13,000 social housing units were delivered in 2015, the first full year of implementation of the Social Housing Strategy.  This represents an 86% increase in unit delivery above 2014, which was achieved in a very difficult operating environment and represents a good start to the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  The targets for 2016 are again ambitious and I expect that over 17,000 social housing units will be provided this year, 1,500 of which are targeted to be delivered through the main capital supply programmes for the construction and acquisition of houses\/apartments by both local authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs).<\/p><p>Following from the substantial announcements of new social housing projects made in May 2015, in July 2015 and in January 2016, we now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction, acquisition and turnkey approvals in place.  Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  Details of these approvals are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:<\/p><p><i><\/i><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>It is these projects that will form the majority of the social housing units to be constructed between now and 2018.  I am keen that local authorities advance these as soon as possible, but I recognise that all projects must proceed through the planning process and this and other factors have a direct impact on the timing for the advancement and the delivery of the approved construction projects.<\/p><p>While construction activity is ramping up, local authorities are using other approaches to deliver new social housing units in the more immediate term, including acquiring properties, with over 1,000 new social housing units secured through that approach in 2015 alone, and working with developers to build and acquire new &lsquo;turnkey developments&rsquo;.<\/p><p>The ongoing rapid-delivery housing programme will provide 500 units for homeless families across Dublin who are currently residing in commercial hotels.  22 units have been completed in Ballymun and another 131 units will be completed in the Dublin City area by end-2016.  A further 350 units will be provided across the four Dublin authorities, with commencement on sites in quarters 3 and 4 of 2016 - these units are to be procured through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, which will be available by end-Summer and will also be available to all local authorities nationally for procurement of rapid-delivery units. <\/p><p>An enhanced role for AHBs in the provision of new supply is also central to the Government&rsquo;s vision for the provision of social housing supports under the Social Housing Strategy.  The Strategy will see the continuation and improvement of the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), with amendments made to accelerate delivery and assist AHBs in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of social housing units. The changes recognise the shift in investment required by AHBs towards construction and acquisition of new builds.  Under this mechanism of local authority and AHB collaboration, a strong pipeline of new units was developed in 2015, with approval provided for 600 units to be built or purchased by AHBs in the period 2016-2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700063#WRN08000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Accommodation Data","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700064#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[9388\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700064#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the emergency accommodation beds available for persons experiencing homelessness, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.

In that regard, Irish Water received a subvention of some &euro;439.1 million in 20 14 for operational expenditure, with &euro;399m being provided in 2015, and &euro;119.75m to the end of April 2016.  This funding from the Local Government Fund is in respect of the child allowance (21,000 litres per child per annum), a product subsidy and the cost of capping domestic water charges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Grants","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[9788\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the key features of the grant scheme for the replacement of lead pipes and fillings within the boundaries of a household including if this grant covers the cost of assessment for lead in a household's pipe network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>Grants are available to assist low-income householders with the cost of replacing lead pipes and fittings within the boundaries of their principal private residence.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>Identical maximum house value limits apply under both MTR schemes.  Specifically, properties should be of a value no more than &euro;350,000 for a house and &euro;300,000 for an apartment or townhouse in the areas of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway; and &euro;250,000 for a house and &euro;190,000 for an apartment or townhouse in the rest of the country.  Priorities must adhere to the most up-to-date acquisition cost guidelines set by my Department.<\/p><p>In addition, for both types of MTR the property must be in negative equity. However, a property that may have marginal positive equity may be considered for inclusion in either schemes where that equity is no more than 10% of the Open Market Value to a maximum of &euro;20,000 in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway and &euro;15,000 in the rest of the country.<\/p><p>Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i><\/i><i><\/i><\/p><p>I can confirm that the MARP and the MTR for local authority borrowers are available on an identical basis for both full annuity local authority mortgage holders and Shared Ownershipborrowers in mortgage arrears. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Lending","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[9861\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his position on the proposal by the Irish League of Credit Unions to provide loan finance for the provision of social housing; why he has not taken up these proposals to date and when he will","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>The agreed <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>recognises the potential role that credit unions can play in housing finance and supports the efforts of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.

The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided to Approved Housing Bodies, by credit unions, for the development of social housing.  My Department has met with the ILCU on a number of occasions to address technical aspects of its proposal.  The most recent meeting was on 13 April 2016.<\/p><p>The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.

The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.<\/p><p>Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.<\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.

A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that the learning from this activity should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.  Therefore, it is important to note that the projects were never intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right, no matter how successful the projects might have been. <\/p>  <p>  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end date of 30 April 2015.

It also provides for balance between the paying members, deferred members and drawing members (pensioners) of a pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, the Minister for Social Protection must make Regulations specifying the percentage which will determine the amount by which a preserved pension benefit is to be increased or decreased in the revaluation year.  Making these Regulations is a legislative requirement and an obligation on the Minister and there is no discretion not to set the percentage where there has been a change in the level of consumer prices during the year.  Under these provisions, the Occupational Pension Schemes (Revaluation) Regulations, 2016 were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 8th of April 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  A person who leaves employment, and who has been a member of their former employer&rsquo;s defined benefit pension scheme, may choose to either leave their accrued pension rights in the scheme of their former employer or transfer their rights to another vehicle which can accrue pension rights.  Where the person chooses to leave their pension rights in the scheme of their former employer, and thereby becomes a deferred member of the scheme, legislation safeguards their rights in the scheme.  Part of this protection is ensuring that their pension value is preserved and revalued annually to keep pace with changes in the annual rate of Consumer Price Inflation.  This maintains the spending power of these pension entitlements to a reasonable level.  <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 provided for a change to amend the imbalanced situation where static or decreasing wage rates impacted on employees&rsquo; potential pension benefits but not on the value of deferred members&rsquo; pensions.  The anomaly had arisen because the annual revaluation for deferred scheme members was limited to a lower floor of 0%. This floor was removed, and the revaluation of deferred members&rsquo; benefits now tracks both negative and positive changes in the annual rate of the Consumer Price Index.  2015 is the first time the revaluation percentage has been negative, resulting in an adjustment of -0.3% to deferred member&rsquo;s prospective pension benefits.  However, it is worth noting that since 2009, the overall change in the revaluation percentage for deferred members has been positive at 4.5%.<\/p>  <p>  It may be noted that the regulations cater for minimum standards.  Scheme trustees, should the scheme rules allow it, are not precluded from applying revaluation rates that would be more beneficial to members where the scheme has the capacity to do so.  For example, trustees may decide not to apply the negative revaluation for 2015.  It should also be noted that these measures will not have any impact on former scheme members where the scheme has already wound up.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":1229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ04450"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[9404\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700066#WRQ04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to backdate to February 2009 the claim of a person (details supplied) who has been deemed eligible again under the disability allowance scheme, the date when eligibility was initially stopped; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>Illness benefit is a payment for people who cannot work due to illness and who satisfy certain pay related social insurance contributions.

To this end, the Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of work related supports, which in 2015 cost an estimated &euro;37 million solely for persons with a disability.<\/p><p>Any young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the INTREO service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres.<\/p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO.  This means that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments are referred to a caseworker, and are engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.  For such young jobseekers, engagement with activation measures through the Intreo service is a mandatory condition for continued receipt of welfare payments.<\/p><p>It was already the situation in respect of young people with disabilities who present at a DSP office needing activation\/intervention type supports that they were referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo or at the Local Employment Service (LES).  There was thus no need to apply the new engagement arrangements to young people with disabilities as they were already in place.  For such young persons in receipt of disability\/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is, however, on a voluntary basis, and is not a condition of receipt of such payments.<\/p><p>A caseworker working with a young person with a disability can arrange access for that young client to the full range of services and programmes that are available to young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the Back to Education Allowance, and Solas training for unemployed people.  The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in any future iteration of the Momentum programme.<\/p><p>Over and above these general programmes, a caseworker dealing with a young person with a disability can arrange access to a range of additional services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other young jobseekers.  These are described in detail below.<\/p><p>In the light of the enhanced existing arrangements already in place, I am satisfied that young people with disabilities already have access to a full range of supports and services.<\/p><p>Specific employability supports for people with disabilities<\/p><p>EmployAbility<\/p><p>EmployAbility is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations (EmployAbility) on behalf of DSP who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate objective is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support.<\/p><p>The Supported Employment Service under EmployAbility is an employment and recruitment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the open labour market.  This Supported Employment Service provides a range of supports to employers and people with a disability, through Job Coaches.  The range of supports includes: <\/p><p>-  Individual Needs Assessment<\/p><p>-  Vocational Profiling and Career Planning<\/p><p>-  Individual Employment Plan<\/p><p>-  Job Sourcing and Job Matching<\/p><p>-  On-the-Job Support and Coaching<\/p><p>-  Advice and Support to Employers<\/p><p>-  Follow-up Support and Mentoring to both Employers &amp;amp; Employees.<\/p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)<\/p><p>The purpose of this demand - led programme is to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  WSS provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.  The Scheme is structured in three strands.  The employer can benefit from one or all, simultaneously.<\/p><p>Strand I subsidy - is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a disabled person, in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week.<\/p><p>Strand II - is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.<\/p><p>Strand III - is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.<\/p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned.  New Applicants for WSS who are currently on Disability Allowance may apply for DA Disregard in conjunction with the WSS provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.<\/p><p>Disability Support\/Awareness<\/p><p>A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under this heading.<\/p><p>A. Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant<\/p><p>B. Job Interview\\Personal Reader Grant<\/p><p>C. Employee Retention Grant Scheme.<\/p><p>D. Disability Awareness Support Scheme<\/p><p>Community Employment<\/p><p>The CE eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as for other Job seeker groups so as to encourage participation.  Those on job-seekers&rsquo; payments generally must be aged over 25 and on a payment for a year or more.

They must be in receipt of a CE-qualifying social welfare payment for the requisite period of time to become eligible for further time on the programme.  These conditions are in place to allow the maximum utilisation of place among the greatest number of participants.<\/p><p>There are no plans to extend the standard CE participation period up to two years minimum as this would result in a reduction in throughput from the scheme, thereby reducing the overall number of CE beneficiaries per year.<\/p><p>The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop skills which can then be used in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  A number of persons who sign on to the Live Register generally exit it again within a short-time frame, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that Community Employment schemes remain focused on those who are long-term unemployed.  As eligibility rests with the main claimant only, the adult dependant of a social welfare claimant is not eligible for CE in their own right.  There are other interventions and activation options for those who are not eligible for CE, for example, advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools.  It is also open to adult dependents of a social welfare claimant to make an application for a jobseekers payment in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  In general participants can avail of 12 months participation on CE.  Lifetime cumulative participation on CE by an individual is limited to 3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age and 6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to and including 65 years of age.  Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps.  Participation on a CE scheme prior to 3rd April 2000 is not counted when calculating the length of time a person can participate.<\/p>  <p>  A pilot initiative was introduced in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits providing the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants aged 62 and over are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for participants over 62 on this pilot within each individual CE scheme are limited to 7% of each schemes overall budgeted places.<\/p>  <p>  The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  It is worth noting that the entry age for dedicated childcare and health and social care positions that involve working directly with service users was lowered to 21 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the above rules as this would result in a reduction in throughput from the scheme, thereby reducing the overall number of CE beneficiaries per year.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to participation by lone parents on CE as childcare is a crucial element for parents embarking on CE or returning to the workforce, the Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme ensures that CE participants get the childcare supports they need to support their participation on the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Local Employment Service (LES) it is intended that the LES provides an intensive engagement with customers and there is a target that 30% of LES customers are placed into full -time employment.

Almost half (49%) of early-finishers say it is to take up employment and a further 7% go on to further education, training or another internship.  About 30% leave for a variety of personal, domestic or health reasons.  14% leave early because they did not find the internship suitable, which is not surprising given that, for many, JobBridge is a first-chance opportunity and sometimes participants find that the particular career direction is not for them.  The Department continues to work with them to support them with a range of alternative pathways to work.<\/p><p><b>Table 1. &ndash; The number of recipients which were participating on schemes in companies that were subsequently disqualified, by year and by employment sector since the scheme was established. <\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Sector<\/th><th>No of interns<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>CHEMICALS MANUFACTURING<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CLOTHING &amp;amp;

","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1478,"content":"<p>The rate of payment under the State pension (contributory) scheme is related to contributions paid over the years into the Social Insurance Fund, and credited contributions where applicable.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.<\/p><p>There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a <i>minimum<\/i>of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies <i>all<\/i>the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no fixed amount of paid and\/or credited contributions required which will qualify a person for a full-rate State pension (contributory).  The total amount of contributions a person will require also depends upon the duration over which they made these contributions, as both of these figures are used to calculate a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions, upon which their rate of entitlement is based.  The payment of 520 contributions in itself does not, therefore, qualify someone for a 100% pension - rather it is the case that failure to have at least that many contributions paid will mean they will not qualify for a State pension (contributory) at any rate.<\/p><p>Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).<\/p><p>Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a lower yearly average of 40 will qualify for a pension at the 98% rate.  Someone with a yearly average of only 10 may qualify for the minimum rate of &euro;93.20.  Averages are rounded up, e.g. where someone has a yearly average of 47.5, it is rounded up to 48.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p><p>It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700069#WRT04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":1479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700069#WRT04550"},{"type":"question","counter":1480,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[10170\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700069#WRT04600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) was eligible for an alternative payment at the same time an alleged overpayment accrued under the family income supplement scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1312","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1512,"content":"<p>The aim of the scheme is to help unemployed people break the cycle whereby they cannot get a job without experience, but cannot get experience without a job.  It caters for a wide variety of jobseekers - those with no previous work experience and unemployed workers who might want, or indeed need, to change career direction to avail of the job opportunities emerging in post-recession Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Since the scheme was introduced almost 19,000 Host Organisations have provided internship opportunities to over 46,500 unemployed jobseekers.  There are at present c 4,000 jobseekers engaged in JobBridge internships.  Independent research indicates that circa 60% of these went on to get paid employment within a short period (5 months) of completing an internship.  This compares very favourably with similar schemes across the EU where the average rate is 34%.  The independent research also indicated that just 10% of participants rated the scheme negatively and that over two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member.  <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that JobBridge is entirely voluntary.  In order to attract potential interns, Host Organisations must provide opportunities that appeal to jobseekers, if they don&rsquo;t jobseekers simply won&rsquo;t apply.  Jobseekers are not under any obligation to participate in JobBridge and those who commence an internship can finish their internship at any time with no penalty of any type. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of measures in place to minimise abuse of the scheme.  First, potential Host Organisations must meet strict terms and conditions in order to participate in the scheme.  All applications are screened on receipt and those that fail to meet the requirements are rejected.  <\/p>  <p>  Second, a Standard Agreement outlining the key duties and hours of the internship placement along with the associated skills, knowledge and learning development to be acquired by the intern.  This must be agreed and signed by both the Host Organisation and intern at the outset of the internship. <\/p>  <p>  Third, compliance reports\/checks must be completed by the Host Organisation and submitted to the Department.  <\/p>  <p>  Fourth, to ensure that Host Organisations are abiding by the terms of the scheme, the Department operates a monitoring regime.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random monitoring inspection visits. <\/p>  <p>  Over 12,500 monitoring visits have been conducted and 98% of these have been satisfactory. In a small number of cases (86) the Department was of the view that non-compliance by certain organisations warranted a decision to debar them from further participation in the scheme, or to suspend them participation for varying durations depending on the nature of the transgression.  This represents less than 0.5% of Host Organisations participating in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A second independent evaluation of JobBridge is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of scheme to date and to inform if and how it should be modified to improve outcomes and\/or address any issues which are identified in the evaluation.  The evaluation comprises a detailed econometric study and comprehensive surveys of host organisation and intern experience.  The Department expects the full evaluation to be completed and report published in September 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":1513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1514,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[10245\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his Department ever received an application from a person (details supplied) under the invalidity pension scheme; the date the most recent application was received; if a decision was made on this application, and the date and nature of the decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1515,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p><p>The department received a claim for IP for the person concerned on 17 February 2015.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 418,000 customers. <\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to estimating the cost of restoring the allowance for 2017, and approximating the average number of claimants in the region of 421,000, it is estimated that the cost would be in the region of &euro;48m for &euro;9.50 per month, and &euro;114m if &euro;22.50 per month.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must have at least 520 paid contributions and satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of  payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  There is no single Pro Rata Contributory Pension.  However there are arrangements which operate on such a basis.  A mixed insurance pro-rata State pension is one of a number of alternative qualifying methods introduced to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for a State pension contributory.  This was introduced in 1991 and was designed to ensure that people who have contributed to the social insurance system at different rates receive a pension which reflects the proportion of full rate contributions which exists in their overall insurance record.  This pension is calculated by taking the total number of contributions (modified and full rate) a person has paid over their working life and applying the average contributions test to arrive at the rate which would be paid if all contributions were at the full rate.  The actual rate to be paid is determined by the proportion of full rate contributions in the overall record.  There are also pro-rata arrangements which may apply when calculating pensions due under international social security agreements.  The requirements to qualify for such pensions may depend upon the circumstances of the person and their insurance record in Ireland and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;222.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU04750"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[10462\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700070#WRU04800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if parents with joint custody and an entitlement under the rent supplement scheme should also be entitled to receive payments under the scheme to provide accommodation that facilitates overnight stays with their children; and the guidelines he provides to his officials make decisions on these cases.

Bilaterally, Ireland continues to convey its concerns about the human rights situation in China directly to the Chinese authorities through regular contacts in both Dublin and Beijing. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland together with our EU partners believes that constructive dialogue between the Chinese Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet and to reach a solution that respects Tibetan culture, language, religion and identity.  It is important for the long-term peace and stability of the region that the two sides come to an agreement on the future of Tibet.  To this end, we continue to encourage a resumption of meaningful dialogue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700072#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":1657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700072#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1658,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[9803\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700072#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is aware of the case of a person (details supplied) who has been imprisoned in the United States of America for more than 40 years; that the person's case was politically charged and the conviction is heavily contested; that the person has been classified as a political prisoner by human rights defenders and organisations and is long overdue for parole; and whether he will raise the case with his counterpart in the United States of America and call for the person's release before the President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, leaves office.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1659,"content":"<p>Leonard Peltier was convicted of the murder of two FBI agents who died during a confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1975.

Where issues of particular importance arise regarding any of these important natural heritage assets, I am kept apprised, on an on-going basis, by my officials.  Given the nature of the wildfires which took place in the southeast of the location, and given the necessity of evaluating the damage caused on an on-going basis, I received a number of oral reports from my officials on the effects of the fires.  At the time of the fires themselves, I was kept apprised of the efforts of the local authority&rsquo;s Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service, the Air Corps of the Defence Forces, the Coast Guard, and my own officials in my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service in combating the fires. Most of the damage caused at the location in question occurred in the upland areas where the fires originated, with heather, gorse and mollinia (grass) burned across a large area southeast of the location.<\/p>  <p>  These upland areas are very important habitats for a number of flora and fauna, including ground-nesting birds, invertebrates, small mammals and many species of insects.  Shortly after the fires abated, my officials informed me that over 1,000 hectares within the location were affected by the fires and that, while the woodlands escaped serious damage, a number of trees, including oak, birch, holly, and arbutus, were scorched by the fires.  I was also advised that a number of deer fences and a part of the board-walks on a long-distance walking trail, which runs through the location were damaged, but that, from an ecological perspective, the damage to uplands habitats was more serious.<\/p>  <p>  Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012 currently prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August.  Section 40(1)(a) specifically provides that it is an offence to cut, grub, burn, or otherwise destroy any vegetation on any land not then cultivated.

This represents a massive milestone for Irish children, young people and families.  The children&rsquo;s hospitals at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght have always provided superb care to children, but their infrastructure is not fit for purpose for modern 21st century children&rsquo;s hospitals.  The new facilities at the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus will allow doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals to deliver safe, quality care in a purpose-built facility, to be delivered by 2020.  Enabling works are to begin this summer.  The planning decision also allows construction to begin on satellite urgent care and outpatient centres at Connolly Hospital and at Tallaght Hospital, which are expected to open in 2018, enhancing access to these services.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Government's decision to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s hospital campus was based on the over-riding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children, and in particular the sickest of these.  It is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will also be built on the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers. In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialities and the highest level of clinical complexity of all the adult hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.  Tri-location of paediatric, adult and, in time, maternity services on the shared campus will create a centre of medical expertise to support research, innovation and education.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to meeting with a deputation, my Private Office has no record of having received a request for a meeting from this particular group.

Under Lifetime Community Rating late entry loadings apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time.  This encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, and continue to retain it, thereby avoiding loadings and helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons.  The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is now 2.126 million, or 46% of the Irish population, (end Jan 2016).  This includes an increase of 104,667 from January 2015 to January 2016 which contributes positively to controlling premium inflation and thereby helps to keep health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  The overall insured population increased by 6%.  The largest increases occurred for ages under 60, (80%) with the remaining increase being in ages over 60, (20%).  The Health Insurance Authority has noted that \"the increases at the younger ages in 2015 may reflect the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating and Young Adult Rates.  The increase in older ages in 2015 mostly reflects the aging demographics of the insured and general population.\"   In addition, the improvement in the economy has facilitated this boost in membership and contributed to the positive effect on the number of people holding health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a robust Risk Equalisation Scheme is also in place to support community rating by equalising risk across the market.  All insurers receive payments from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of their older and less healthy customers, and this is funded by stamp duties levied on all policies written.<\/p>  <p>  Insurers with less older members are net contributors and insurers with greater older people are net beneficiaries.  This market wide support to community rating ensures individuals continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product, keeping health insurance affordable for older and less healthy members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700076#WRAA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":2019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700076#WRAA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2020,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[9723\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700076#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical cardholders by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2021,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

These medicines include benzodiazepines and certain z-drugs, however zimovane is not controlled at present.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or supplying it in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Following a Court of Appeal decision on 10 March 2015 which declared unconstitutional the section of the Misuse of Drugs Act empowering the Government to declare substances to be controlled under the Act, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was urgently enacted to recontrol all substances which had previously been declared controlled by Government order.  A further Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled and to clarify the provisions under which Ministerial Orders and Regulations are made is currently being drafted.  The text will be finalised when judgement is received on a Supreme Court appeal on section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act &ndash; the case was heard on 12 April.

The need for regulatory action is not based on numbers of reports - which may be influenced by availability on the market, the extent of use and public awareness of an issue - but is considered in the context of this continuous safety monitoring and ongoing evaluation.  EU regulators continuously monitor the safety of the HPV vaccines and routine ongoing pharmacovigilance activities are in place to review any new safety signal, should they arise from the Eurovigilance database of adverse reactions, published literature, or from any other source of information.  Safety monitoring includes the review, follow up and onward reporting of individual suspected adverse reaction reports submitted to national competent authorities such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), as well as evaluation of data from the published literature, epidemiological studies and any additional clinical trial results.<\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.<\/p><p>I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The HSE  strives to provide the appropriate care for all patients no matter what their illness.  The girls and their families should seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for diagnosis and management.  A number of non health supports are referred to in these questions.  As the Deputy is aware my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, has responsibility for Disability Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance Schemes.  <\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. <\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school. <\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 200,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, which the HPRA participated in, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. There are no plans to carry out  any further  reviews at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2245,"qnumday":792,"qnumall":"[10117\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the best practice in terms of frequency of check-ups for those diagnosed with diabetes; if it is recommended that those with diabetes attend a quarterly check-up; if this level of frequency is considered necessary to manage the condition; if the HSE has outlined targets in respect of the number of check-ups for those diagnosed with diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2246,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The decision means that enabling works can commence this summer.  It is expected that the satellite centres will open in 2018 with building work completed on the main site in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  During the design process, there has been extensive engagement and consultation with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff from the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals and with local residents.  This has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people.  The planned accommodation will include facilities for inpatients, day care patients, outpatients, operating theatres and emergency care.  There will be 380 inpatient rooms, all of which will be single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, 93 day-care beds and 20 operating theatres.  The hospital will also include play areas, external gardens and courtyards. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to access, the campus at St. James&rsquo;s hospital benefits from a full suite of transport options including private car, national rail, Luas, bus, bicycle, pedestrian and taxi.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the public transport accessibility of the site, the need of most parents to access the hospital by car is recognised, and ample parking has been provided for families based on current and projected future demand.  1,000 car parking spaces are being provided, with a minimum of 675 of these intended to accommodate family parking.  This is based on an assessment of the level of parking demand, developed in consultation with the medical planning team.  The NPHDB has confirmed that this level of parking provision will facilitate 100% car parking provision for inpatient, day case and emergency attendances, and 65% car parking provision for outpatient attendances.  The car parking stock and appointment schedules will be actively managed to ensure that all patients wishing to avail of parking will be facilitated. In addition, a condition of the planning permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that a minimum of 20 spaces be marked and designated as &ldquo;parent and child&rdquo; spaces and reserved for parents of children with specific needs (equipment etc.). <\/p>  <p>  In regard to parking costs, these will be considered in due course having regard to the needs of patients and families, including families of long-stay patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":2270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD06500"},{"type":"question","counter":2271,"qnumday":804,"qnumall":"[10193\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700079#WRDD06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"how many of the 36 posts sanctioned nationally to support the implementation of the type 2 diabetes cycle of care initiative will be sanctioned to support the diabetes community in County Waterford; when he will put those sanctioned for County Waterford in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2272,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government states \"We will extend the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance in Budget 2017.

It also commits to expanding the role of community pharmacists, in managing the health of their patients and in medicine prescription.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 14 GP Specialist (Vocational) Training Programmes in operation in Ireland and doctors who wish to pursue GP training in Ireland may apply for a general practice training post in one of these programmes.  At present, all GP training programmes are of 4 years duration and all trainees are required to complete 2 years in a hospital setting and 2 years in general practice with a GP trainer.  The number of GP training places increased from 120 prior to 2010 to the current level of 159 per annum.  The HSE is planning to further increase the GP trainee intake to 172 with effect from July 2016, which is an increase in capacity of over 40% since 2010. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the salary costs of the GP trainees themselves, the overall cost of expanding GP training would depend on the cost of various training inputs required.  The Department does not hold that specific data.  However, it can be said that currently GP trainees are paid an average annual salary of &euro;76,000 for the two years they spend training in a GP practice, whilst the average training cost per trainee is &euro;33,000.  Based on these figures, the indicative cost of increasing the current intake from 159 to 200 would be approximately an additional &euro;5 million per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  As the HSE does not directly hire GPs, it is not possible to quantify the financial implications for the HSE of additional GPs being hired to provide services to the public health system under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and other schemes.  GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service, which include allowances for the hiring of practice nurses and secretarial support.  The amount payable in respect of certain supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contract GPs, also based on the size of each doctor's GMS panel.<\/p>  <p>  As the training of GPs is currently a matter for the Health Service Executive, these questions have been referred to the HSE with a request that they respond directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the Executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700081#WRFF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":2394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700081#WRFF03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2395,"qnumday":846,"qnumall":"[10311\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700081#WRFF03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his progress in introducing free general practitioner care; the number of citizens in receipt of this; his plans to further roll out this care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2396,"qnumday":847,"qnumall":"[10312\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700081#WRFF03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of introducing free general practitioner care to all persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2397,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 846 and 847 together.<\/p>  <p>  GP care without fees has been successfully introduced for children under the age of 6 years and all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees, without having to undergo a means test.  The under 6s service includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease, including asthma and diabetes care.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the Government made financial provision for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 to 11 years.  It is envisaged that this third phase will bring the total number of those eligible for universal GP care, without having to be assessed by a means test, to approximately 1.2 million people.  The Programme for Government commits to extending in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, the introduction of free GP care to under 18s.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated additional cost of providing a universal general practitioner service to the entire population will depend on the future scope of the service, fees and payments to GPs, and eligibility rates.  Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation in 2015, the parties have commenced talks on a new GP contract.

The objectives of the Strategy are to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy distinguishes between those Actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available.  Those identified for first implementation include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Clear responsibility for dementia to be assigned within the HSE.  A dedicated Office, has been established within the HSE to support implementation of the Strategy;<\/p>  <p>  -  Clear descriptions of care pathways, and better information and guidance on services to be made available to GPs and to people with dementia and their families and carers; <\/p>  <p>  -  A better understanding of dementia, including modifiable risk factors, to be promoted;<\/p>  <p>  -  The use of existing resources to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best way possible;<\/p>  <p>  -  Research to inform the design and delivery of dementia services in Ireland to be supported and given appropriate priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme represents combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.<\/p>  <p>  This programme is promoting a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. <\/p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p>  <p>  -  the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;<\/p>  <p>  -  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.<\/p>  <p>  -  measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  Progress has already been made on a number of fronts.  The HSE has established a central Dementia Office to drive and oversee implementation of the Strategy.  Work has commenced on the development of a Dementia Friendly Ireland programme to raise awareness and increase understanding of the condition.  Research into the educational needs of GPs and Primary Care Team members is underway, and a body of training will follow when this is complete.  Roll-out has commenced of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, and people with dementia have benefitted to date.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970, as amended, the assessment of full eligibility for health services (and the issuing of a medical card) is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.  There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition and this is in accordance with the Health Act 1970.  <\/p>  <p>  An Expert Panel was established by the Health Service Executive in 2014 to examine and recommend a range of medical conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility for a medical card.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It is important to note that the Panel concluded that it would not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order as a means of determining medical card eligibility. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Government approved a range of actions to improve the performance of the medical card system as it is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 104,000 at the beginning of May 2016.   <\/p>  <p>  Following the Expert Panel report, a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established by the Director General of the HSE to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system which can strive to ensure that the relatively small percentage of cases requiring the recognition of the burden of a medical condition(s), over and above financial hardship, can be accommodated.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700082#WRGG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700082#WRGG04850"},{"type":"question","counter":2506,"qnumday":885,"qnumall":"[10420\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700082#WRGG04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware that psychology services for school-age children with disabilities in County Laois have been suspended; the action he will take to remedy this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2507,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people and disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Building on the recent upturn in the economy two initiatives were introduced from 1 May 2015.  Lifetime Community Rating and reduced premiums for Young Adults promote the sustainability of the insurance market as a whole.  Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.  The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is now 2.126 million, or 46% of the Irish population, (end Jan 2016).  This includes an increase of 104,667 from January 2015 to January 2016 which contributes positively to controlling premium inflation.<\/p>  <p>  We have a highly competitive insurance market.  While I welcome the recent reduction in the number of products  from 416 at end 2015 to 354 now, I agree that product proliferation is not in the interest of consumers.  I have asked my officials to examine what supports could further reduce products.  In the meantime many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by taking advantage of promotional offers and by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at www.hia.ie.  All of the health insurers provide a number of lower cost plans, making it possible for consumers to find the same level of cover for a cheaper price.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would remind the Deputy that Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and make their own commercial decisions including pricing policies.  The Minister for Health has no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s prices.  You may wish to note however, that in the 12 months to end December 2015, the average gross premium received by insurers was &euro;1,173, which represents a 2% decrease on the average premium received in 2014 (&euro;1,200). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700084#WRJJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Accommodation Provision","counter":2633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700084#WRJJ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2634,"qnumday":932,"qnumall":"[10603\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700084#WRJJ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"why the Health Service Executive chose Collinstown, County Westmeath, as its location for a new residential home; if it carried out a feasibility study into the suitability of the site considering it is located on a secondary country road that has no footpath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2635,"qnumday":933,"qnumall":"[10604\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700084#WRJJ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rationale behind the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s decision to relocate its care facilities from St. Peter's estate in Castlepollard, to bungalows in Castlepollard then on to Collinstown in County Westmeath; the executive's future plans for the buildings and grounds of St. Peter's Estate in Castlepollard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Evidence suggests that the sector can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms.  The emergence of Ireland&rsquo;s artisan food sector, supported by growing consumer demand for niche products and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, has generated many new small food companies. Most are owner managed, frequently have a farming basis, and produce diverse products, demonstrating high potential for innovation.  These &lsquo;artisan&rsquo; businesses are defined as micro-enterprises with a turnover of up to &euro;2 million, employing fewer than 10 people and producing food in limited quantities (weekly average under 1,000 kg or litres ) using skilled craftspeople, a traditional method, and characteristic ingredient(s) produced within 100 km ( FSAI Guidance Note 29 ).<\/p>  <p>  The FoodWise 2025 strategy recognises the value of this sector and its potential for development and employment.  A number of artisan businesses have to date participated in successful programmes such as Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves\/Supervalu) and Food Works ( developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland) which have generated new business.  Several artisan businesses are full members of the Bord Bia Origin Green sustainability initiative and many have participated in Bloom, Marketplace and other fora which link producers up with buyers and support them in demonstrating their own capability and the quality of their food and drink products.<\/p>  <p>  Within the artisan sector, the farmhouse cheese sector includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level.  My Department is supporting a three year programme managed by Bord Bia under the EU Promotion Scheme to promote and increase awareness of farmhouse cheese.  It is projected that with the overall increase in milk production following the abolition of milk quotas, farmhouse and specialty cheese output could increase to just over 4,500 tonnes per annum worth around &euro;33m without requiring significant additional capital expenditure.  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":2783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2784,"qnumday":986,"qnumall":"[9438\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the numbers employed in the agrifood industry continue to remain constant or if they have increased over the past number of years; his views on its future prospects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":2785,"qnumday":1000,"qnumall":"[9576\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if numbers employed in the agrifood industry remain constant or if they have increased over the past number of years; if he is satisfied with the future prospects of the sector in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2786,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 986 and 1000 together.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s four Quarterly National Household Surveys in 2015 showed that employment in the agri-food sector overall, including all its component parts, averaged approaching 170,000 throughout the year.

Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to the implementation of the Food Wise strategy.  I will chair the fourth meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, in mid-June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":2787,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2788,"qnumday":987,"qnumall":"[9403\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700087#WRMM01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to ensure that outstanding payments due to a registered farm partnership (details supplied) that have been subject to a review will be paid out immediately in order to enable the applicants comply with the mid-May date for 2016 applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2789,"content":"<p>The persons named established 49.65 Entitlement Allocation Rights with a total value of &euro;13,545.45 and 65.67 Entitlement Allocation Rights with a total value of &euro;28,400.81 including the Greening payment under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.

An additional advantage for on-line applicants this year will be the implementation of preliminary checks. Under this provision on-line applicants will be informed, within a specified time frame, of a number of common land errors (over-claims, dual claims and overlaps) and be given the opportunity to avoid area penalties as would have been applied in previous years.

However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This will require businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be put on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month stand still period I would be confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.<\/p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.

These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.

Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.<\/p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.

To help deal with this situation, a new control framework was introduced by the European Commission.  One of the important new tools was introduced under  Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009 of 20\u00a0November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (the EU Fisheries &ldquo;Control&rdquo; Regulation), which requires Member States to inter alia have in place legal provisions to implement a Points system for serious infringements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  The number of points to be attributed for specific infringements is fixed at EU level.  The EU requirement is that every time a serious infringement is committed, the appropriate number of points will be attributed to the licence holder of the vessel concerned.  This EU Points system is applicable to all fishing vessels which fish in the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, whether they are Irish or Foreign flagged<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Ireland had previously implemented the required EU Points system for serious infringements by fishing vessel licence holders\u00a0by means of Statutory Instrument No. 3 of 2014 which gave effect to the EU requirement in Irish law.  This Statutory instrument was the subject of two recent High Court challenges\u00a0and was struck down.  The two High Court Judgements are subject to appeal at the advice of the Attorney General.  There are a number of broad legal reasons for the appeal which go beyond fisheries.  From a fisheries perspective the concerns relate to<i><\/i>the potential implications the judgements may have on the efficient and effective implementation of the points system in Ireland in the future.<\/p><p>As Ireland is required to have in place a legal instrument implementing the EU Points system a new amended legal instrument was drafted, following the advice of the Attorney General, which took on board, to the extent possible, issues of concern in relation to procedures and process which had been highlighted in the High Court Cases<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The previous Minister was faced with a difficult choice when the Court struck down the previous regulation implementing the EU points system.The approach he chose was taken to support the vast majority of law abiding fishermen depending on healthy fish stocks.  The alternative would have exposed law abiding Irish fishermen to the serious consequences of illegal overfishing by a small number of Foreign and Irish fishing vessels, thereby threatening the future of our industry.  The previous Minister, accordingly, signed the replacement legal instrument, with amended procedures and processes, (S.I. No. 125 of 2016 - European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System)\u00a0Regulations 2016) on 1 March 2016<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Deputy refers to the UK system under which, as I understand, points are applied to <i>inter alia <\/i>an English-registered fishing licence if the licence holder is convicted of a serious infringement in a UK court.  There have been proposals that the EU points system in Ireland should similarly be combined with a successful prosecution through the Courts.On the surface, this appears like a reasonable option and it was examined carefully.\u00a0 However, the legal advice received was that this approach does not meet the legal requirements set down by the EU points system, in the context of the Irish legal system.<\/p><p>Firstly, in the majority of infringement cases, the Licence Holder is a different person or legal entity to the person on the vessel (the skipper) who commits an offence and who will be prosecuted.\u00a0 Therefore, there is no connection between the assignment of points to the Licence holder and the prosecution by the Courts of offences under fishery law.\u00a0 In addition, the EU regulations require that points be assigned from the date of the detection of the 'serious infringement' and will remain on a licence for three years from that date.  That requires that the procedures are sufficiently swift to be determined in as short a time as possible.Fishery prosecutions under the Irish legal system, taking account of the Constitutional provisions, may take some considerable time before they are finally determined and if the EU points are linked to the completion of the prosecution, they would have limited impact as the three year timeframe would be well advanced or indeed may well have expired.<\/p><p>The previous Minister considered all of the concerns raised by the Deputy, other Deputies and by the fishing industry in relation to the implementation of the EU points system for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy.  He met with representatives of the fishing industry to discuss this and other matters as recently as last week and the issue was also discussed in this House in the context of Statements on Agriculture on 4th May 2016. <\/p><p>As outlined in those Statements, the previous Minister has asked in recent weeks the Attorney General, as a matter of urgency, to examine the Statutory Instrument which he signed into law at the beginning of March.  He asked her, in particular, to consider the issue of whether there is a way that the assignment of points for licence holders can await the completion of the prosecution process, while at the same time ensuring that Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law.  I am following up on this request. <\/p><p>It is my intention to report back to An Oireachtas as soon as I have received the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and I have examined a way forward in the context of that advice.  Subject to that advice together with an assurance that Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law<i>, <\/i>and as outlined in the new Programme for a Partnership Government, I would be open to amending the current SI to move further to meet the concerns raised in particular in relation to the assignment of points following the completion of the prosecution process.<\/p><p>The current SI has been in force, however, since 1 March 2016 and this remains the position.  My understanding is that no points have been assigned or recorded to date there under.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that I plan to bring forward primary legislation to <i>inter alia<\/i>give a sound legal basis to a scheme that implements the EU points system for licence holders. This will enable An Oireachtas to examine options and arrangements that meet EU regulatory requirements.<\/p><p>Finally, the EU Control Regulation requires Member States to implement two points systems to be applied in cases of serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy, one for the Fishing Boat Licence Holder (as outlined above) and one for the Master of the Fishing Vessel.  Accordingly, it is anticipated that this proposed primary legislation will also contain provisions governing a points system for Masters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700088#WRNN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":2870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700088#WRNN04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2871,"qnumday":1018,"qnumall":"[9712\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700088#WRNN04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to extend approval of a forest road grant for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2872,"content":"<p>The application by the person named under the Forest Road Scheme reference CN70451 was approved with an expiry date of 31 December 2015.

The overall framework for a new CFP was agreed by the European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in 2013.  The Review of the Policy had commenced in 2009 and was the subject of active consultation and debate over the 2009 to 2013 period.  The Policy is thereby set and the arrangements for the setting of Quotas, the management of fisheries, the introduction of the phased implementation of the landing obligation and the responsibilities of Member States are all set out within the settled Framework of the new CFP.  The proposal suggested by the Deputy on behalf of one group of fishermen must be considered in this context.  <\/p>  <p>  The Demersal Discard Plan to apply for 2016 was unanimously agreed by all Member States of the North Western Waters Group and submitted to the EU Commission in May 2016.  It has since been evaluated by the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and approved by both the European Parliament and the full Council of Ministers.  The Member State Group worked in close consultation with the industry body, North Western Waters Advisory Council, representatives of which attended each meeting of the North Western Waters Group at Director and Technical level since January 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Landing Obligation for demersal species is due to come into effect from 1 January 2016 and will apply to all TAC species by 2019.  This period of phasing in was a key plank in the negotiations of the new CFP Reform and was pushed strongly by Ireland to avoid a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; and to allow time to adjust behaviour.  The North Western Waters Advisory Council (NWWAC) advised that they also wanted to avoid a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; in 2016 or 2019.  In line with this, the Member States are committed to a progressive and incremental introduction of the landing obligation over the period 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019.  The landing obligation will be phased-in for other fisheries in the years leading up to 2019, when it will apply to all stocks.<\/p>  <p>  Only certain demersal stocks will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016.  For Ireland the stocks affected this year are Nephrops (Prawns) in Area VII, Whiting in the Celtic Sea, and Haddock in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the landing obligation is to gradually phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and to end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  If discarding can be gradually reduced and ended it will rapidly allow stocks to rebuild so that there will be higher quotas of commercial fish available to Irish fishermen, thereby underpinning their future.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal from the Deputy is not a matter of national policy choice for Ireland and would not be in keeping with the legal requirements set out in the Landing Obligation and the wider Common Fisheries Policy.  The new CFP continues to rely upon clear Quota outtake limits for Member States and imposes clear legal obligations for Member States to respect those quota limits.  National legislation continues to require vessel licence holders to respect the appropriate quota limitations applicable to their vessel.   <\/p>  <p>  I would like to also note that at the December Fisheries Council in Brussels, which determined the TACs for 2016, the values of whitefish and prawn quotas available in 2016 were increased for the third consecutive year.  Stocks which were coming under the Landing Obligation in 2016 were granted additional quota uplift for 2016, to reflect the changed policy in respect of those Stocks.  The overall 8% increase in quota for prawns, which would otherwise have been subject to a 2% decrease in line with the scientific advice, includes a 10% quota uplift to support the introduction of the discards ban.  Similarly the 26% increase in Celtic Sea whiting includes quota uplift as does the 40% increase in the Irish Sea Haddock Quota. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, earlier this year, we launched new funding schemes to support the implementation of the landing obligation.  Those schemes provide for a &euro;241 million investment in the seafood sector and are co-funded by the EU.

The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving\u00a0cashflow planning at farm level, which\u00a0will be rolled out shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level.  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016.   Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will be a challenging year.   <\/p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector.  The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play.  These measures are not enough on their own, however.  The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers.  I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.   <\/p>  <p>  Production decisions are made by producers, taking prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account.  The challenge posed by price volatility has been highlighted by my Department and others over a number of years, and indeed my Department has, including through its agencies, invested significant resources in providing farmers with advice and technology designed to improve on farm efficiency, reduce production costs, and make farm businesses more resilient in times of downward price pressure.  The abolition of dairy quotas in April 2015 allows farmers the freedom to make these production decisions on a commercial basis.   <\/p>  <p>  That said, support must be offered to the sector in times of market difficulty . In this respect, I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March.  This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector, where the duration of market downturn has gone well beyond previous expectations.   <\/p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers.  I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present.  At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs.  The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015.  In addition my Department recently paid   &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms. <\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool.  My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.  We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":3039,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3040,"qnumday":1076,"qnumall":"[10581\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ04300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures he proposes to introduce to assist dairy farmers following the decision by the European Union agriculture Council at the March 2016 meeting to give member states the option to provide farmers with state aid up to &euro;15,000 per year for a period up to three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":3041,"qnumday":1077,"qnumall":"[10582\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures he proposes to introduce to assist pig producers following the decision by the European Union agriculture Council at the March 2016 meeting to give member states the option to provide farmers with state aid up to &euro;15,000 per year for a period up to three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3042,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1076 and 1077 together.  <\/p><p>In response to the ongoing market difficulties in the dairy, pigmeat, and fruit and vegetables sectors, the Council of Agriculture Ministers agreed a further package of measures in March 2016.

Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.<\/p><p>The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). <\/p><p>The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017. <\/p><p>These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s <font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department.  This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.<\/p><p>As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. <\/p><p>On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan in our bilateral meeting last week and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":3047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":3048,"qnumday":1080,"qnumall":"[10613\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700091#WRQQ05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Donegal has not received any disadvantaged area payments for over two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3049,"content":"<p>An application under Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS) was received from the person named on 15 May 2014 and an application under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was received on 29 May 2015.

Responsibility for both monitoring compliance and addressing non-compliance with such obligations rests with ComReg.  The design of the individual networks is a matter for the operator concerned, although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of services to all customers can be affected by several factors given that mobile telephone services are a radio based technology and therefore services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, the capacity of the network and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.<\/p>  <p>  Any customer, including those in Cavan and Monaghan, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.  My Department understands that mobile operators are in the process of upgrading their networks across Ireland.

The policy\u00a0and general practice at international level\u00a0is to exempt State and military aircraft from such charges. This derives from the exemption of State aircraft from the scope of the Chicago Convention establishing the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Ireland,\u00a0in common with the vast majority of Eurocontrol's 41 States, subscribes to this practice.<\/p><p>A\u00a0breakdown by country of all\u00a0exemptions\u00a0from en-route charges is included in the latest Eurocontrol Report on the\u00a0Operation of its\u00a0Route Charges System in 2015, published in March 2016. This Report is\u00a0available on Eurocontrol's\u00a0website at the address indicated below.<\/p><p>In relation to the reply to Parliamentary Question 146 of 5 May 2016, the reference to\u00a0the wider aviation safety and economic benefits was made in the\u00a0broader\u00a0context of the benefits accruing to civil aviation activity from the collaborative and cooperative approaches inherent in Ireland's membership of\u00a0Eurocontrol.<\/p><p>Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental organisation currently comprising 41 European States and as such provides a key forum\u00a0for cooperation and collaboration between States at a detailed technical level in the provision of air navigation services for almost 10 million flights per annum in European airspace. Aviation is inherently an international business,\u00a0hence the overarching necessity for cooperation and collaboration between those States in organising the detailed arrangements to be applied to\u00a0international flights. It is not a practical proposition for an individual State to contemplate instituting its own aviation safety or economic arrangements in isolation from the practices and procedures being developed and implemented on an ongoing basis at a multilateral level in an organisation such as Eurocontrol.<\/p><p>In terms of Ireland's role in the overall Eurocontrol context, we have a pivotal geographical position between North America and continental Europe. Irish controlled airspace acts as a gateway for\u00a0aviation\u00a0between these two continents and in 2015 the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), on behalf of the State, safely and efficiently managed over 1 million flights. This equated to an average of 2,811 flights every day managed by the IAA at Irish State airports, through Irish controlled airspace and on the North Atlantic. This level of activity generated some &euro;183 million in turnover to the IAA in 2015, nearly all of which was collected by Eurocontrol and remitted to the IAA.<\/p><p>In this context, whilst there is a\u00a0monetary cost arising from the\u00a0exemption of\u00a0military flights from en-route charges, it is considered\u00a0that these costs are more than offset by the value of the benefits flowing\u00a0from Ireland's position as a gateway for transatlantic aviation, as organised through our\u00a0membership of Eurocontrol.<\/p><p>\u200bNote: The Eurocontrol\u00a0Report is\u00a0available at:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700094#WRTT03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licence Renewals","counter":3205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700094#WRTT03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3206,"qnumday":1133,"qnumall":"[9964\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700094#WRTT03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is aware that persons over 70 years of age will have to present themselves in person at National Driver Licence Service centres every time they wish to renew their driving licences, as they must present an up-to-date medical certificate with each application, which constitutes a change in their details; his views on whether this is fair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3207,"content":"<p>The operation of the driver licensing service\u00a0is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

Since 2011, the Government has launched a range of measures to improve the competitiveness of the economy, to provide a range of supports for the start-up and growth of small business, to reduce red tape and other costs, and to get credit to good businesses to support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.<\/p><p>These measures, across a range of policy areas and agencies, are captured in the Annual Action Plan for Jobs, which ensures a consistent and comprehensive approach to supporting business development.<\/p><p>The newly launched Regional Action Plans will ensure that at local level, all of the necessary supports are available to encourage new business start-ups and development and that job creation is spread evenly across the country.<\/p><p>In one particularly acute area of policy &ndash; namely the ability of small businesses to access finance &ndash; we have introduced a number of measures in recent years notably the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme and Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p>We will continue to listen to the needs of small business through the Small business Advisory Group, as well as the Retail Forum, both of which are chaired by my Department.<\/p><p>As a small open economy, sustainable long term economic growth is dependent on continued success in international markets.  Our policy focus is on export led growth in the first instance, driven by innovation, competitiveness and productivity. <\/p><p>We know from the progress achieved in restructuring the economy since 2011 that a competitive export-led enterprise base is at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s longer term economic growth prospects.  The potential to reach 2.180 million in employment by 2020 is based on the premise of export-led growth and would see an additional 266,000 people at work from a 2014 base.  Our strategy is to build up all sectors in the economy and to ensure that progress is balanced across the country.  With limited financial resources, it is also important that our strategic interventions and supports have a particular focus on deriving the maximum impact and national economic value.  We must minimise the risks of investing in deadweight projects that would have happened in any event and in the displacement of one business with another.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s role is to create the right conditions needed for sustainable, rebalanced economic growth.  Markets can&rsquo;t function without impartial regulation and enforcement of contracts, effective competition policy and the rule of law. So our role is about providing leadership and setting direction, setting the right policy frameworks and investing selectively.  Government also provides direct supports to businesses that meet the necessary criteria but grants are only available to enterprises with the capacity to export.  This has always been an important policy principle which shall remain.<\/p><p>Since the 1990&rsquo;s it has been acknowledged that the attraction of foreign direct investment must be complimented by a clear national effort to develop and grow our own domestic base of exporting companies and to develop clear national advantage in key sectors of strength.  We will compete by increasing productivity, by developing higher-end products and services, and by being the first to tap into new niche markets.<\/p><p>Our indigenous enterprise policy is focused on supporting a greater number of start-ups with better survival rates, more Irish owned companies of scale, more companies increasing their investment in research, development and innovation to boost their competitiveness, and more enterprises exporting across a range of markets.  The challenge of the new Government is to prioritise where we will place further efforts to best effect over the coming years - so that we continue to achieve positive results and make a difference to our enterprise sector.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is the body charged with developing the indigenous exporting company base.  With an annual budget of &euro;300m EI provides direct grants to business and takes equity in start-ups with potential.  It supports management capability and innovation in companies that want to grow, supports the provision of seed and venture capital to enable more high quality start-ups to expand and it invests in the R&amp;amp;D capability in third-level colleges and the commercialisation of research.<\/p><p>We have a narrow base of exporters and not enough Irish firms growing internationally.  We have endeavoured to align our policies and invest in those areas that will support longer term sustainable enterprise growth and stability.  These policies are working well.  Export intensity in Irish owned enterprises has increased from levels of 37% of total sales in 2003 to 51% in 2014, showing continued improvements in our indigenous firm capacity, capabilities and competitiveness.  Enterprise Ireland has in recent years established a Potential Exporters Division to help Irish companies to look outside the domestic market.<\/p><p>Another major policy initiative in recent years has been the creation of the Local Enterprise Offices as the &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; service for all entrepreneurs and micro- businesses. LEOs can offer information and advice on setting up or expanding a business, including the variety of supports available. They can offer &lsquo;soft supports&rsquo; in the form of training or mentoring and in certain circumstances can offer financial support or referral to Microfinance Ireland loans. <\/p><p>Finally, I should mention that the range of supports to budding entrepreneurs and small businesses are available via the online Supporting SMEs Toolkit which can be accessed at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700097#WRWW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":3356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700097#WRWW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":3357,"qnumday":1186,"qnumall":"[10400\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016051700097#WRWW01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will examine the issues that affect seasonal workers, particularly in the fishing sector; her plans in response to a study on the prevalence of zero hours contracts as carried out by her predecessor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  Over half of all referrals received by Tusla are welfare concerns and Tusla's policy is to refer these to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  A social worker works with the parent\/s to support them provide safe care for their child.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse. <\/p>  <p>  Figures for 2014 show that there were 24,954 child welfare concerns and 18,676 child protection concerns received by Tusla.  Information on the number of referrals is available for the first nine months of 2015, with a total of 18,873 child welfare concerns and 13,730 child protection concerns received in that period.  Referrals come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the community or health sectors.<\/p>  <p>  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  The priority or category of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on information received on the case.  At the end of February 2016, a total of 20,262 open cases had an allocated social worker while 5,694 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of those awaiting allocation 902 were deemed to be High Priority.  It is important to note that \"High Priority\" should not simply be equated with risk.  These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to Tusla who need a continuing social work service. The additional funding of &euro;38 million which the Government has allocated to Tusla for 2016, will give the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified demand and to alleviate pressures being faced in areas such as unallocated cases.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to services provided by Tusla and its own complaints mechanism where specific issues may be raised, the child welfare and protection services are overseen, inspected and regulated by independent bodies, the Ombudsman for Children and the Health Information and Quality Authority.

Some people were placed in life long family care arrangements, where a child was in the custody of a person other than his or her parent or guardian and where no adoption order was effected.  These arrangements were never formalised. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will provide that persons separated from their mothers at birth may apply to Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency for information.

The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.

The statutory duty of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, is to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  There are many reasons for children coming into Tusla's care including abuse and neglect but disability alone, whether intellectual or physical, is not one.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla provides child welfare and protection services to all children, including those with special needs.  I am advised by Tusla that children in care who have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate or severe disability avail of disability services operated by the HSE.  In some cases, this includes residential care provided by Disability Services.  <\/p>  <p>  It is Tusla&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to any concern or report of abuse or risk of abuse to any child, irrespective of a disability or whether they are at home, already in care or living in a HSE residential centre provided by Disability Services.  In such circumstances, Tusla will assess the child's situation.  Decisions by Tusla to apply for a care order with respect to a child with a moderate or severe disability are made at a multidisciplinary case conference where the views of professionals who have long established knowledge of the child and family are heard.  <\/p>  <p>  Placement is based on assessed need.  A child with a disability may be placed with a Tusla foster care family or residential unit and receive disability services.  Of the 6,398 children in care at the end of February 2016, 93% were in foster care.  Where a child is already attending a disability service it may be in the child's best interests to be placed in the disability service's residential care to allow for continuation of relationships, care planning and to avoid a disruption in placement when the child reaches the age of 18 and is discharged from Tusla's care.  Tusla and the HSE have a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins service provision for children whose needs span health and child protection.  <\/p>  <p>When a child is adopted he\/she is considered a child of the adopter(s) and may access the full range of services which are currently available to all Irish children.

This was commonly known as &lsquo;pay parity&rsquo;.  Such pension increases normally required the prior approval of the Minister for Finance \/ Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p>Since then, there have been effectively no public service pay increases and, as a consequence, no pension increases either.  Rather, due to the fiscal crisis faced by the country, significant cuts to both public service pay and pensions were applied by way of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 (the FEMPI Acts).  <\/p><p>In respect of pensioners, including Defence Forces pensioners, the key FEMPI retrenchment measure has been the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  Introduced in January 2011, with deeper cuts to higher pensions applied from July 2013, the PSPR&rsquo;s progressive design provides that it has never applied to annual pensions below &euro;12,000, and at present no pension below &euro;18,700 is affected by PSPR.  By contrast, those employed as public servants all experienced pay cuts in 2010 regardless of salary level, together with a Pension Related Deduction (PRD &ndash; &lsquo;pension levy&rsquo;) applied since 2009 to earnings above &euro;15,000.<\/p><p>In tandem with gradual pay restoration under the &lsquo;Lansdowne Road Agreement&rsquo;, and as legislated in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, a multi-stage part-restoration of the PSPR cuts to pensions is now in progress.  The initial focus is on the people in receipt of relatively low pensions who are impacted by PSPR.  This provides for a restoration of pension income affected by the PSPR on a phased basis over three years to most PSPR-impacted pensioners as follows:<\/p><p>-  From 1st January 2016 &ndash; return of &euro;400 per year<\/p><p>-  From 1st January 2017 &ndash; return of &euro;500 per year<\/p><p>-  From 1st January 2018 &ndash; return of &euro;780 per year.<\/p><p>It remains the position of Government that, in still-constrained fiscal conditions, pay and pension assistance measures for public servants and retired public servants should focus on the roll-back (part-reversal) of earlier FEMPI-delivered reductions (pay cuts, PRD, PSPR).<\/p><p>In the 2015 White Paper on Defence (Section 7.7) particular emphasis is given to a Veterans Policy.
