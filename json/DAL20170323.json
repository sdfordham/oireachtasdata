It is almost a year to the day since we had another attack, in Brussels, where 32 people lost their lives.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, my party leader and my colleagues I would like to express our condolences to the families of the four people who lost their lives yesterday and to wish all the other people who were injured as part of that incident a speedy recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I wish to raise with the T&aacute;naiste regards job creation.  She will be well aware of the Succeed in Ireland initiative, a concept which grew out of the recent Global Irish Economic Forum.  It is an idea and plan for job creation which was sponsored by the Government, managed by the IDA and its running was contracted to an organisation called ConnectIreland.  It is fair to say, by any measure, this initiative can be considered an outstanding success when one considers that, around the globe, there are now in excess of 80,000 members of the Irish diaspora connected to this programme in more than 147 countries.  We have seen 81 companies locate in this country as a result of the initiative creating more than 2,000 jobs, with a yield to the Exchequer in excess of &euro;300 million over the life of the programme and an estimated yield to our GDP of &euro;1.8 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this it is very important that the T&aacute;naiste know, appreciate and understand that ConnectIreland is a not-for-profit company.  It gets paid for job creation on a no-foal, no-fee basis.  Every job it creates costs &euro;4,000 whereas an equivalent job created by the IDA costs in the region of &euro;11,000, so the value for money can be seen.  Significantly, it has gone a long way towards addressing the urban-rural issue we have, which has arisen because the Government and the IDA have not been pushing enough jobs into rural Ireland with the result that there has been a concentration of jobs coming into the greater Dublin area.  <\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 21 March, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation met with ConnectIreland and officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It was a very unsatisfactory meeting because the IDA and Enterprise Ireland failed to show.  It is fair to say that there was cross-party support and a unanimous view that the work of ConnectIreland has been very successful.  It has been proven to bring jobs into Ireland and into rural Ireland in particular.  Now we are at a point where on 26 March, which is this Sunday, the contract is due to expire.  The contact was extended by a year to allow for a review.  That review has not gotten under way.  We have had complete inertia from the Government and from the Department in regard to establishing it. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a lot of momentum built up, there have been many leads generated, there have been many contacts generated and there are many potential jobs in the pipeline as a result of the Succeed in Ireland initiative and the work of ConnectIreland.  It is coming to a shuddering halt on Sunday next.  We are asking the Government see common sense.  Will the Minister step in and extend the contract?  There is precedent because the contract was previously extended for a year.  She should extend it for the period and duration of the review, which is about to get under way and for which we do not have the terms of reference.  Can we have some common sense from Government and extend this contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300003#A00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1490270400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I join with the Deputy in his opening comments as this is the first opportunity we have had in the D&aacute;il to respond to the dreadful events in central London and outside Parliament in Westminster yesterday.  I know that every Member of this House will join with me in expressing our outrage at this cowardly and evil act against innocent and defenceless people.  We, like all right-thinking people, utterly condemn and reject such awful actions.  Our thoughts and sympathies are, of course, with the families and friends of those who have lost their lives, among them PC Keith Palmer.  He gave his life on duty in Westminster yesterday.  We also think of the many men, women and children who have been injured and we hope for their speedy recovery.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that there is an Irish citizen among the injured.  I am advised that the person's injuries are not considered life-threatening and that the Irish Embassy in London and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will offer all assistance to that person and to their family.  I have conveyed my sympathy and offered our full support to the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, MP.  I spoke with the British ambassador this morning to express our sense of solidarity and our shock at these awful events.  The ties that bind us across the Irish Sea are very close and strong.  We feel, very keenly, that same sense of shock and horror that our colleagues, families and friends in Britain feel.<\/p>  <p>  This is being treated as a terrorist attack and it has the hallmarks, as the Deputy said, of other attacks in Brussels and Paris.  Whatever the motivation, there can quite clearly never be any justification for this type of inhumanity.  I have been briefed by the Garda authorities and I spoke with the Commissioner this morning.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in constant contact with its UK counterparts, directly and through its liaison person there.  Ireland cannot consider itself immune from the threat posed by international terrorism and extremism.  The expert advice is that while an attack is possible here, it is unlikely.  All possible steps are being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Defence Forces where necessary, to deal with any threat to this country.  They will continue to work very closely with UK and international colleagues to make sure that we remain safe.  There are a small number of people here whose activities are a cause for concern in terms of supporting terrorism.  The authorities will continue to monitor them very closely.  Today, however, is really about expressing our sympathy to all who have been affected by this appalling outrage in London.<\/p>  <p>  On the points the Deputy raised about ConnectIreland and the Succeed in Ireland initiative, there was a detailed discussion on that in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, made the situation in that regard very clear.  It was borne out of the Global Irish Economic Forum with the aim of, rightly, involving our global diaspora.  The context that should be put behind this is the fact that job creation has been so successful in this country.  A strong policy has brought us to a point where unemployment has reduced from 15% to 6%.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's point on extending the contract, the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, made it clear yesterday that it is not legally permissible, due to public procurement law, to extend the contract.  It has already been extended by one year, and if the programme is to continue the IDA would need to put it out to tender.  The board considered the future of the programme at its meeting in November and made the decision not to re-tender at this time.  That does not mean that a definitive decision has been taken in respect of the initiative's long-term future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300003#A00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490271000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is very important that the T&aacute;naiste appreciates that we will lose a lot of momentum and initiative which has been built up if the contract comes to an end on 26 March.

The Taoiseach said yesterday that litigation was pending and the matter was <i>sub judice<\/i>, but that is not the case.  We have to appreciate that ConnectIreland is asking for the contract to be extended for the duration of the review, and it will be happy to take its chances when the contract is advertised for re-tendering.  Allowing all of the good work to fall does not make sense to me and my party.<\/p><p>On the legal advice quoted by the T&aacute;naiste, ConnectIreland has received legal advice from Arthur Cox.  It is one of the largest legal advisers in the country and the Government and State rely on its advice.  Arthur Cox has stated:<\/p><blockquote>We cannot agree that there should be any public procurement concern in extending the contract and, in particular, there is most certainly in our view no legal impediment that would prevent an extension of the contract to allow ConnectIreland to generate new leaks and approvals for companies to establish in Ireland depending the departmental review of the initiative and the resulting decision on whether or not to extend the contract ... It is both legally permissible and entirely appropriate in the circumstances and we cannot identify any legal impediment while the IDA are refusing to do so.<\/blockquote><p>Can the Government not see common sense and allow the initiative to continue while the review gets underway, bearing in mind that it is not yet underway?

It is striking that there has been little public debate on this issue.  Bus &Eacute;ireann plays a major role in the life of this nation, including rural Ireland, the cities outside the capital and the school transport system.  The closure of Bus &Eacute;ireann would mean &euro;59 million payroll taxes from its 2,600 workers being lost, as well as the expense of hundreds of millions of euro in redundancy and social welfare payments.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can tell the House the exact amounts that would be involved.<\/p>  <p>  On the \"Six One\" news programme yesterday, Ingrid Miley said Bus &Eacute;ireann management had pulled the pin out of the grenade.  It was an apt metaphor for what is a declaration of war on workers' wages as many workers will lose &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 in take-home pay under the plans.  It is also a war on bus services.  Dates have now been provided for the axing of some routes and the cutting back of others.<\/p>  <p>  The stakes in this dispute are high, and include the protection of take-home pay, the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the future of public transport in the State.  It is in the interests of every public transport worker and everyone who cares about public transport that Bus &Eacute;ireann workers defeat these cuts and that the Government is forced to properly fund public transport.  A national public transport strike involving significant solidarity action from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann  and Dublin Bus workers could turn a long drawn-out battle with an uncertain outcome into a shorter and sharper clash which secures victory for the bus workers and forces the Government to invest in public transport.  Such action now needs to be given very serious consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Public transport in the State is significantly underfunded.  The PSO subvention covers a mere 10% of total income, compared to more than 50% in other European states.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann was compensated in full for its free travel pass work it would receive an extra &euro;17 million and the crisis would be averted.  Instead, we have a do-nothing Government and a do-nothing Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who refuses to intervene.  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, acts as though he is on an episode of \"Friends\", the one where Ross folds his arms, tells us that it is a doddle and lets the national bus company go to the wall.  <\/p>  <p>  What will that cost?  Can the T&aacute;naiste give us a precise or an approximate figure?

Trade unions are meeting today to consider their response.  It is regrettable that last week's WRC discussions adjourned without agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that since then the company and trade unions have highlighted that efficiency improvements are possible in terms of how the company organises itself.  That is a significant signal which Members of the House should consider.

Last year, the taxpayer provided approximately &euro;230 million to Bus &Eacute;ireann across the PSO, free travel scheme and capital and school transport funding programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Trade unions and management have publicly acknowledged that issues need to be dealt with within the company in terms of efficiency.  They are exactly the type of issues that the Minister, Deputy Ross, has consistently identified when he has addressed this issue.

Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular, the Littleton plant in my constituency, has been traditionally known for its production of briquettes for more than 40 years and has given valuable employment to people from Littleton, Killenaule, Templetuohy, Thurles and surrounding areas.  The facility in Littleton can be traced back to Bord na M&oacute;na's roots.  Recently, to safeguard the facility in Littleton, workers have accepted restructuring proposals from management and unions through the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  This is a clear commitment that the workforce at Littleton briquette factory is committed to its future.<\/p>  <p>  Recently we have heard about a Bord na M&oacute;na review of peat production operations and briquette manufacturing factories.  This has led to concerns and fears among more than 120 workers at the Littleton plant.  Bord na M&oacute;na is going through a difficult time in terms of the sales of briquettes, principally because of the imposition of carbon tax at the insistence of the Green Party in the 2010 budget.  At that time, I negotiated a derogation for peat produced products but it was reintroduced in 2013.  Since 2013 the carbon tax has doubled meaning that there is a 50 cent tariff on every bale of briquettes produced.  On top of that, the import of unregulated fuel products from Northern Ireland is a massive problem in the marketplace for Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The current review by Bord na M&oacute;na of its peat operations is of fundamental and critical importance.  Its recommendations will shape the future of peat production in Ireland.  It will determine what quantities of briquette production will be required for the marketplace in the future.  It will also determine the number of production facilities and recommend the location of the factory or factories.  Its recommendations will have far-reaching implications and shuddering consequences.  It has the potential to destroy livelihoods and to consign workers and dependent families to financial hardship.  The outcome of the report is capable of wreaking havoc on local communities.  Therefore, the report is a very serious matter that must treated in a professional, responsible, fair and caring manner.  <\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste must understand that this is a nerve-tingling time for the employees of Bord na M&oacute;na, whether they are in Tipperary, Offaly or another part of the midlands.

However, I recognise the points the Deputy has made on the concerns of the employees in both places at present.  Bord na M&oacute;na is facing significant business challenges in the context of the deregulation of the electricity market and increasingly competitive and challenging environments across all its business areas, not least its fuels business.  It has been operating at a level significantly below capacity in recent times and there are a number of initiatives under way at present.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive review is being undertaken at present on the operations at Littleton in County Tipperary and Derrinlough in County Offaly.  The review will examine projected demand for peat briquettes as well as the plans for biomass and the combined capacity and infrastructure needed to deliver production to meet the forecasted demand.  A serious analysis is being carried out at present on the production capacity and the demand and how they can be matched.  As it requires much input from a number of people, the review is not expected to be finalised before May at the earliest.  We will await the review and its analysis.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, Bord na M&oacute;na has been working with and briefing staff and employees in the fuels business have been briefed on the review.  I assure the Deputy that I understand that ongoing updates will be provided to them.  Management has also provided assurances that no decision on the future of the plants will be taken until the review is completed.  At the very least, we must await the outcome of the review in May.  No one at this point can predict the recommendations that will be in the review, but there are a number of initiatives taking place which it is hoped will give the best outcome for the jobs about which the Deputy speaks.  For example, there is a pilot trial for the production and sale of a biomass briquette made at its factory at Littleton for the past 12 months.  The development of a biomass briquette is a significant investment by Bord na M&oacute;na Fuels and a critical step in future proofing the jobs the Deputy is highlighting and meeting the particular challenges faced by the company at present.

These figures speak for themselves and are completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The equine industry is an important industry in most rural counties, including counties Kildare, Tipperary and Limerick, and employs thousands of people in rural areas.  As with many other industries over the years, the sector has been reclassified as a leisure industry.  This decision will bring the equine industry to its knees.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the Government will immediately review the relevant legislation and prevent further rates increases to try to retain vital jobs in rural areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300006#D00600","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1490272200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>On the same issue, I attended a meeting in Kildare last night at which representatives of the equine industry made an extremely strong case.

The current cap on state aid at &euro;200,000 over a three-year period must be addressed in a comprehensive manner by the Government and the European Union.

Irish enterprise needs to continue to increase its share of the global market for green goods and services.

I want to ask the Minister about the capital gains tax, CGT, relief which applies to entrepreneurial gains, and I have raised this issue with her previously.  As she knows, the 10% rate of CGT applies to entrepreneurs up to a limit of &pound;10 million in the UK.  We have a very unfavourable regime in this country.  Young entrepreneurs will go to the UK and seek to generate enterprise and business there because they are not getting the same break here.

Capital gains tax entrepreneurial relief introduced in 2017 provides for a reduced CGT rate of 10% for entrepreneurs.  The reform of CGT is a work in progress and I have secured the competitive 10% CGT rate.  The relief will be kept under consideration and, depending on its operation and the resources available, can be revisited in the context of future budgets.

We were contacted by a 14 year old girl and her mother.  She has presented to the HSE twice with suicidal thoughts.  Her father committed suicide when she was younger and her uncle also committed suicide.  She wrote a letter to the office of the Minister for Health recently.  She received an acknowledgement but nothing since.  I would like to read a piece of her letter in order to reflect her own words:<\/p><blockquote>Dear Minister Harris,<br \/><br \/>I am fourteen years old and from Wexford.  I am writing to you to tell you my experience of seeking help for my mental health.<br \/><br \/>In January 2016 I asked for help as I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and struggling to come to terms with very tragic bereavements in family.<br \/><br \/>I was referred to psychology services in the HSE.  They met with my Mam and then me in June 2016.  They said they could help me, but I am on the waiting list.  I was informed that I would be waiting between 1-2 years.<br \/><br \/>In December '16\/ January '17, I had thoughts of suicide again and of being unable to cope.  I was very confused and emotional.<br \/><br \/>On Wednesday the 18<sup>th<\/sup>of January &rsquo;17, my doctor put me into A&amp;amp;E to see a mental health group.  I saw a normal doctor and he told me that I had to stay in one night so I would be seen quicker. <br \/><br \/>On the Thursday morning, I was told I was going to be seen but as the day went on, we heard no more.  When the doctor was doing his rounds, my Mam asked the nurse what time were CAMHS coming at and the nurse said they aren&rsquo;t coming anymore.  After that I was made stay in hospital until Monday the 24<sup>th<\/sup>.  I was scared and very anxious and did not understand why I had to stay in hospital.  I just needed someone to talk to and help me deal with my low mood and emotions.<br \/><br \/>I was finally seen on Monday by CAMHS and got discharged with no appointment for help still.  They said I needed a psychologist and they don&rsquo;t have one on their team and they would have to contact the other service.  I would like to know why there is no help for children when they ask for it?  What can you do or what can be done to stop other children going through this?  <\/blockquote><p>I spoke about a similar matter recently in the D&aacute;il when we had statements on hospital waiting lists.  I referred to a woman who approached me in a supermarket in Wexford whose son presented with suicidal ideation and spent five days screaming for help in Wexford Hospital.  Child psychiatry and child psychology services were not available through the county until someone was eventually dispatched from Dublin.  <\/p><p>The girl who wrote to the Minister, Deputy Harris, also spent five days in hospital before she was able to speak to mental health professionals through staff from CAMHS.  They assessed her and said she had no psychiatric disorder and, therefore, she did not require their services but instead those of a psychologist.  The mother and teenager to whom I referred have gotten nowhere after 14 months, two GP referrals, two assessments with CAMHS and psychology services and one five-day stint in hospital, despite the fact that CAMHS and psychology services say she needs help.<\/p><p>The people in Wexford are tired of begging for proper services.  The Minister of State can tell me about all the extra funding that is being provided and what is being done, but it is not being felt in Wexford by the people who need help from the State.  Such help is not there for them.  What in God's name can the Government do to help?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300018#Q00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1490279400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for raising this important matter and acknowledge the contents of the letter he read, which was very bravely written by a 14 year old.  I know the Deputy will understand that I cannot comment on nor do I have information on individual cases.  Having reared two children, I now find it very challenging to get my head around the fact that so many young people are familiar with the term \"suicidal ideation\", never mind taking action.  Our society seems to have changed to a significant extent.<\/p>  <p>  Children and adolescents who present with suicidal ideation in Wexford, depending on their presentation or presenting problem, may be referred to a number of services including a school counsellor, teen counselling service in the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service, the HSE child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Wexford, the HSE primary care community psychology services, or the HSE self-harm intervention programme.<\/p>  <p>  Child psychology services are delivered by a number of different agencies, including CAMHS, which employs psychologists, primary care psychology services and disability services for children with intellectual disabilities or autism.  All referrals for CAMHS services come from a GP to a consultant psychiatrist and the CAMHS team.  The team prioritises who is most urgently in need of psychological intervention.  Children and adolescents assessed and diagnosed by the team with a mental health disorder, and assessed as needing psychological intervention and at risk of suicide or who are highly distressed, are prioritised.<\/p><p> Wexford mental health services have advised that the CAMHS psychologist relocated in November 2016 but that a replacement psychologist has been appointed for CAMHS.  This psychologist will start next week on 27 March.  I know the Deputy will welcome this news.  Upon commencement in the post, it is intended that the CAMHS psychology waiting list will be triaged and appointments will be offered based on prioritisation of clinical need.  In addition, approval has been granted to recruit a staff grade psychologist post in CAMHS and the process for recruitment is under way.<\/p> <p> Psychology services in Wexford are delivered through primary care and disability services across the catchment area of Wexford.  Children or young people are usually referred to primary care psychology services for a number of behavioural or emotional concerns.  It is more common for young people to raise suicidai ideation as a concern during their assessment or intervention rather than it being a reason for referral to primary care psychology unless a previous assessment has been completed, for example, by CAMHS.<\/p> <p> When a young person discusses suicidal ideation within an assessment and-or intervention, he or she receives a thorough psychological assessment and intervention is offered to a high standard.  In recent years a number of factors have impacted on waiting times in psychology services.  These include population growth in the Wexford area, significantly increased service demands and more complex demands and, as referred to earlier, staffing challenges.  As with many other areas throughout the country, there are staffing challenges within Wexford psychology services, including maternity leave, sick leave and reduced working hours, which are impacting on waiting times.  Unfortunately, there is also an overall national shortage of psychologists at this time which has contributed to increasing waiting times both locally and nationally.<\/p> <p> The HSE tells me that it continues to endeavour to address such issues that arise through a number of measures.  These include continuing to actively fill approved posts, monitoring waiting lists in line with available resources and prioritisation criteria and reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into geographicaIly-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the national progressing disability services for children and young people programme, which will ensure a more equitable delivery of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300018#Q00600","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490280000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I know this is not her responsibility but the truth of the matter is that not only are psychology services in Wexford poor and not only is the HSE's approach to the problems that prevail in Wexford very poor, but there is not near enough emphasis on psychology.  I am not even sure if there is a psychotherapist on the books of the HSE.  Perhaps there is, but I am do not know of it.<\/p>  <p>  The girl I mentioned needs psychological help, psychotherapy or counselling.  CAMHS have psychotherapists but not psychologists on their team.  Publicly-funded psychotherapy and counselling is practically non-existent in Wexford.  The girl and her mother met the HSE psychologist in Grogan's Road in Wexford in June 2016.  The psychologist stated that the girl was a candidate for the service and that it could help her but that there is a waiting list.  The Minister of State spoke about the waiting list problem.  However, in February 2017 her mother asked for an update on child psychology services for the girl.  She was told that the HSE psychologist the girl met in June 2016 had left and that there was now only one psychologist working with children in the county.<\/p>  <p>  We were also contacted this month by the mother of a seven year old boy in Wexford.  This boy has waited for a year and a half to access CAMHS and occupational therapy.  The boy goes to his local school in Wexford but he does not attend the mainstream classes there as he has expressed a wish to kill himself in front of other students.  He is seven years old.  The boy was referred to the senior child psychologist in Wexford in March 2015.  He has been waiting since then to see a child psychologist.  He has now been waiting for more than two years.  A seven year old child has expressed a desire to kill himself but he is yet to get the help he needs.<\/p>  <p>  We have had one of the highest rates of suicide for a number of years.  The last time I checked - a couple of weeks ago - we had 19% unemployment.  We are not getting the help that we need and the HSE's approach leaves too much to be desired.  Will we ever get a Government to address the dysfunctional nature of how the HSE operates?  The mental health services available in Wexford today are pathetic and something has to change.

I wish to provide some form of reassurance because I know the Deputy is frustrated at particular issues - we all are.  It is heartbreaking to think that the child the Deputy referred to would be experiencing such thoughts at that age.  The self-harm intervention programme that was established in Wexford in 2004 is a free and confidential service.  Children under 16 years of age experiencing that are referred by a GP or another medical professional to the service.<\/p>  <p>  Ferns Diocesan Youth Service, which is funded through the HSE and partly funded by Tusla, is doing additional work.  It provides supports for young people who are referred into the HSE substance misuse services.  We must recognise that those engaged in the misuse of alcohol and other psychoactive substances are more prone to suicidal ideation.  Those in the LGBTI community are also impacted in this regard and, in particular, are at risk of self-harm.  To try to be positive, that there was a new appointment should certainly try to get things back at the level we want them in Wexford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300019#R00300","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","time":1490280000,"counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300019#R00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1490280000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue today.  I have been trying to raise it for the past six or seven weeks.  Eventually, my time has come.<\/p>  <p>  To provide background to the situation, this concerns the Cheshire home group and, in particular, my local one in Tullow in County Carlow.  Cheshire Ireland is a non-profit provider that is predominantly funded by the HSE.  It currently provides support services in 17 different residential centres in addition to a range of community-based services throughout the country.  It employs approximately 700 people.<\/p>  <p>  A new policy on residential support for persons with disabilities has been agreed between the HSE and resident services providers.  This policy is outlined in Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion, which was published by the HSE in 2011.  It aims to provide residents of congregated settings with alternative accommodation and care services in mainstream communities.  In order to implement the policy, the Cheshire home group, as has other residential care service providers, has proposed to progressively close all their institutions that are serving ten or more people by not later than 2019.  As the Minister of State knows, this process is currently under way and will result in compulsory redundancies of a number of catering and domestic staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Cheshire home group has experienced financial difficulties in recent times and since 2008 has been in severe difficulty.  In an effort to counteract these difficulties, it entered into an agreement with SIPTU, the INMO and Unite in 2014 under the Labour Relations Commission.  As part of that agreement, the HSE was to fund a number of the outstanding issues of the Cheshire home group.  This was supposed to happen by December 2015 at the very latest.  As of today, it has not happened.  Almost all the staff have been made redundant in my local Cheshire home which is almost closed as most of the service users have been moved out to the community-based services.<\/p>  <p>  A commitment was given that no more staff would be made redundant until this issue was resolved.  My understanding is that staff are to be made redundant in the next number of days and this issue still has not been resolved.

Cheshire Ireland provides a range of support services to people, often with very complex and high support needs with both physical and neurological conditions in their homes, residential centres, supported accommodation and stand-alone respite facilities.  Cheshire Ireland is funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, with services based throughout the country, including Tullow, County Carlow.  The Health Service Executive has in place service level agreements with these providers, funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, which set out the level of service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and requirements regarding standards of care.<\/p><p>In 2017, as part of the overall service arrangement which the HSE community health care organisation No. 5 has with Cheshire Ireland, a funding allocation of &euro;1.965 million will be provided to Carlow-Kilkenny community services.  The Carlow-Kilkenny disability manager and finance manager reviewed the service level agreement file and advised that, at the service level agreement meeting in 2016, Cheshire Ireland indicated that it would undertake staff redundancies.  I am informed, however, that the HSE did not receive any request for funding from Cheshire Ireland for these costs.<\/p><p>As the individuals employed by section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff, including any pension arrangements.  Accordingly, such arrangements offered by individual providers will vary.  I confirm to the Deputy and House that the pay and superannuation terms and conditions of the staff concerned are not subject to the control of the Department of Health as the employees are not classified as public servants.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked a specific question on a commitment given by the Health Service Executive at a meeting of the Workplace Relations Commission.  I have no information on that matter and I am not in a position to make any commitments on redundancies in the company concerned.  I will, however, endeavour to establish what precisely is the position regarding the HSE's commitment. <\/p><p><b>Deputy Pat Deering:<\/b>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  With the greatest respect, however, I am slightly disappointed and frustrated with it because my information differs entirely from the information provided.  A Labour Court decision issued on 16 December 2015 recommended that the Cheshire Ireland engage with the Health Service Executive.  It states: &quot;Having regard to the Employer's financial difficulties and substantial dependency on the HSE for funding, the Court further recommends that the employer should engage in early course with the HSE with a view to securing the necessary additional funding required.&quot;  My understanding, and that of the staff, trade unions and everyone else concerned, is that the HSE, in conjunction with Cheshire Ireland, would facilitate this particular matter.

The review is clearly the result of a decline in sales of peat briquettes, although production continues by virtue of the need to stockpile.  The review is centred on the operations in Littleton and Derrinlough.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies are well aware of the history of Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands region, particularly in my home county.  The company is the lifeblood of the community and the bedrock of its economic life.  It continues to contribute to education, culture and sport in the region.  It is imperative that every effort is made to assist the company in its efforts to diversity and meet the demands of a changing energy and heating regime.  These factors and cost of oil have affected the sale of briquettes. <\/p>  <p>  Some time ago, I pointed out to the Minister that the previous Government had reintroduced and subsequently doubled the carbon tax on peat products.  It did so against a backdrop of Bord na M&oacute;na's efforts to diversify into new products and methods which would enable it to thrive given that peat production and excavation is to be discontinued from 20130 onwards.  Fianna F&aacute;il sought to have a proportion of the proceeds of the carbon tax generated from Bord na M&oacute;na products held in an enterprise or innovation fund to assist with the development of alternative industry and employment in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has diversified in the generations since the company commenced operations.  Co-operation, negotiation and consultation were engaged in before agreement was reached between the company and the workforce.  This shows the good will the workforce has shown in seeking to secure the company's future in the face of a number of challenges. <\/p>  <p>  This morning, the T&aacute;naiste stated the role of Government and Minister with responsibility for this area is one of oversight and policy making was not directly involved.  Policy making played a role in the past when a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government saw fit to develop new power plants in Edenderry, Shannonbridge and Lough Ree that would have co-fuel potential.  There is an onus and responsibility on elected representatives and the Government to ensure Bord na M&oacute;na, a semi-State company, receives State assistance in its efforts to diversify.  I contend that it was a direct intervention by a previous Government, in introducing a carbon tax on peat products, that led us to the position in which the briquette factories face a live threat.  More important, the Government failed to ring-fence the income generated from peat in an innovation and enterprise fund, which would have assisted the workforce and region and ensured alternative industries could emerge from this process and prosper.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not wish to belittle the obligations imposed on us by carbon policy in general, if one Government saw fit to have a derogation for peat products, another Government should recognise that fact.  Instead, it decided to reintroduce and double the tax without establishing an innovation fund to ensure a seamless transfer to alternative opportunities and industry.  We have reached a red light and redeployment will be required between the two peat briquette plants, where possible.  This is despite the fact that the ash content in the Derrinlough plant is such that production at the site is much more cost efficient than anywhere else.  I ask the Government to seriously consider, even at this late stage, establishing an innovation fund using carbon tax revenue from peat industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300020#S00500","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1490281200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The introduction of a carbon tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the combustion of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  Peat briquettes have among the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result, they are among the dirtiest fuels, and given the environmental impact, it is important that they are taxed.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is legally bound to reduce emissions by 20% on 2005 levels in 2020 and 30% on 2005 levels by 2030,as part of the European Commission's climate and energy package to tackle climate change.  The carbon tax was introduced in 2010 as part of an overarching energy strategy and is a key tool to reduce emissions towards meeting these and other climate change commitments.  While carbon tax was introduced in budget 2010, its application to solid fuels, including peat briquettes, was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply. Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011.  The carbon tax was introduced to solid fuels on a phased basis, initially at &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May 2013 and subsequently at &euro;20 per tonne from 1 May 2014, thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emissions.<\/p>  <p>  While tax increases are unpopular, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise.  In this instance, a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  As a matter of principle the reliefs from the carbon tax are limited to ensure as wide an application as possible.  Placing a carbon tax on solid fuels also offers an opportunity to develop cleaner more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative fuels.  To complement the introduction of the carbon tax, especially for those at risk of fuel poverty, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland provides a number of fiscal supports to energy users.  The better energy homes programme provides grants - more than &euro;200 million to date - to assist home owners improve the energy performance of their houses while the better energy warmer homes funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost-effective to run.<\/p>  <p>  In the Finance Act (No. 2) 2013, the Minister for Finance legislated for the introduction of reliefs from carbon tax for solid fuels which contain a certain proportion of biomass.  Last November, this relief was commenced, which exempts the biomass element of the solid fuel from carbon tax and I understand that Bord na M&oacute;na is currently in the process of developing such a fuel which should result in a cheaper more sustainable fuel which is better for the environment.  As A Programme for a Partnership Government states, \"climate change is the global challenge of our generation\", and work is ongoing in all Departments towards developing and implementing Ireland's first national mitigation plan, which aims to deliver a pathway enabling transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The draft plan is open for public consultation and is published on the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment website with submissions invited from interested parties by 23 April.  A key part of developing the plan has been the preparation of robust technical, environmental and economic analysis to evaluate the impacts of a range of different climate change mitigation options.  The carbon tax is, and will continue to be, a fundamental pillar of the transition towards a decarbonised economy and society by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax was introduced in 2010 and was reintroduced by the following Government.  It was always going to increase over time on a phased basis, as was indicated, to bring in line with other fossil fuel taxes and as part of the strategy to move us away from dependence on them, for which we pay a significant amount to import.  They are also detrimental to the environment when we burn them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300021#T00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1490281200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I had hoped the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment who has an oversight role relating to Bord na M&oacute;na among other semi-States, would be present to deal with the matter but I take it his Department felt it was more appropriate for the Department of Finance to respond considering its responsibility for the implementation of the carbon tax.  I acknowledge the will of the Government to move towards a decarbonised economy over time but, unfortunately, it has failed to recognise the value of peat production and the energy sector in the midlands and, in particular, Bord na M&oacute;na's role in that regard.  The company has produced over time excellent fitters, mechanics, and electricians and through education thereafter, helped the economies of the towns and villages they built to prosper in the region and to expand the opportunities for the children of these staff which were not necessarily available to those who were at the forefront and put in place initially.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has failed to recognise that this sector in its efforts to diversify and move to a different economy and in its efforts to move to having different driving forces within the local economy should be shown the respect it deserves in so far as a fund should have been put in place, which could have derived from the doubling of the carbon tax by the previous Government.  It was an ideal opportunity to help and assist Bord na M&oacute;na and other companies within the region to ensure alternatives enterprises, industries and opportunities would ensue over time, considering the advancements that have been made in respect of infrastructure and connectivity to Dublin and other centres of population, education and so forth.  That opportunity was lost.  While I do not doubt the merit of the carbon tax, I implore the Minister of State to provide alternative opportunities in this region by ring-fencing the carbon tax yield from the products manufactured by companies in the region for reinvestment in the community.  An innovation fund should be put in place as peat production is decimated, as evidenced by falling sales, notwithstanding the fact that the staff need to know about their future and their prospects for redeployment.  Should they not be recognised and their future provided for by virtue of the fact that the ash content is at such a level that it is very productive for the Derrinlough factory to continue to produce briquettes?  I implore the Government to reconsider ring-fencing the carbon tax on these products to find alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300021#T00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1490281200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The carbon tax was always going to increase, as per the plan when it was introduced in 2010, to bring it line with the taxes on other solid fuels in the market.

The plan on its introduction in 2010 was to bring it in line with the tax on other fossil fuels and that has happened.  The Government is well aware of its responsibilities in this regard and it is meeting them.  A number of supports remain in place while these changes take place.  The changes were well flagged and mitigation measures were taken.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer to alternative opportunities has been happening.  Bord na M&oacute;na staff has expertise and it is doing excellent work.  The Government and the Deputy understand that the impact of the carbon tax will inevitably be evidenced in the sale of peat briquettes, which is what is happening, but it also provides an opportunity and an incentive to transition to cleaner and more suitable fuels in the future.  The chief executive officer of Bord na M&oacute;na stated the company has been undergoing seismic change in the transition from its traditional peat-based activities towards more sustainable businesses.  This also demonstrates that the carbon tax is having the desired effect with industry responding to the changing landscape and working towards delivering a cleaner, healthier future for all our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300021#T00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","time":1490281200,"counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300021#T00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1490281200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue again.
