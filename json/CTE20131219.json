Because the matter is so pressing, NAMA should be given an opportunity to respond to the committee immediately while these allegations are ongoing.  It seems many people would like to see NAMA damaged and leaking information to the media is one way of doing this.  We need to be careful and cautious in how we deal with this issue.  The first thing we need to do is to give NAMA an opportunity to respond, even if that means inviting its representatives to the committee.  I know that we only have one day left in this session, but it is important that we give them a chance to respond.<\/p><p> Today's newspapers report on the issue of undervaluing loans.  I understand that under the NAMA Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out a review and audit every three years of how loans are valued.  I ask Mr. McCarthy if he has looked at this issue and, if so, did he find anything concerning how loans are valued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900003#B00900","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387447500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes, it is an issue at which we have looked.  In fact, we have already reported twice on the issue of loan acquisition.  Members will recall from previous occasions when NAMA's representatives were before the committee that the concern was that NAMA might have overpaid, not underpaid, the banks for loans.  I wish to provide some information on the process used and what the findings were.  The loans acquired by NAMA were initially valued by valuers on behalf of the banks transferring the loans.  NAMA reviewed all of these and accepted the valuations for around 73% of the loans by value.  For the remaining properties, it sought a second valuation which it commissioned.  As a result of these valuations, there was a write-down relative to the banks' valuations which in total were about &euro;2.3 billion on that 27% of the loan book.  Some 90% were reduced in value; therefore, 10% were accepted on the bank's valuation.<\/p><p>  Another point worth bearing in mind is that part of the strategy for NAMA was to add an uplift for the long-term economic value relative to the market value at the time.  What NAMA would have done, taking the valuations, was to add an uplift, which averaged out at about 8.3% on top of the market value at the time of acquisition.<\/p><p>  Overall, it is difficult to see how across the portfolio there would have been an underpayment, considering the approach NAMA took.  From an audit point of view, we looked at that issue and sought the assistance of the Valuation Office and of a former Commissioner of Valuation in Northern Ireland to review the process NAMA had applied.  The conclusion was that the valuations had been carried out in accordance with industry standards.<\/p><p>  In addition, because there was an element of an overpayment relative to market value, the valuation process was examined by the European Commission which approved it.  Effectively, the concern was that there was an element of State aid built into it.  It is difficult to see how, on a broad scale, there would have been an undervaluation and an underpayment on the assets taken on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1387447500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>That is really what I am getting at.

It was that serious and important that we ask them; otherwise we will go through the Christmas and new year period with significant information being given to the media by whatever party.  NAMA's representatives have indicated that they will be putting out statements in response to some of the material already in the public domain.  They will also make statements to counter other statements made.  As a result, NAMA's representatives are anxious and willing to come before the committee having heard the concerns expressed by me and others.  They have suggested that even if members want to invite them today or tomorrow, they are willing and anxious to come.  They will be issuing statements on issues and out of courtesy said to me: \"All of these statements are going to be out there and we have no opportunity to put them before anybody formally.\"  The question for members of the committee is, having been told this, what exactly do they wish to do.  What is their choice?  Do they wish to bring in NAMA's representatives?

NAMA's representatives mentioned the Official Secrets Act, the NAMA Act and the personal contractual arrangements they had made with individuals.  However, they need to answer that question.  If there are no constraints, the matter needs to be dealt with both by NAMA and the Government.

We need to consider it because we need to be in a position to question in an informed fashion.  It cannot simply be an opportunity for NAMA to set out its stall.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Caroline Piggot, director of finance.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the pension scheme administered by the Mater hospital on behalf of circa 180 staff members of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.<\/p><p>  The Mater hospital administers this scheme at the direction of the Department of Health and with the full approval of the HSE.  The payment of &euro;660,000 per annum made by the CRC to the Mater hospital is the CRC's employer's contribution in respect of its staff pension scheme.  For historical reasons, which I will elaborate on later, the Mater hospital administers this scheme for the CRC staff as part of the voluntary hospital superannuation scheme, which is known as the VHSS, and is the pension scheme applicable to all voluntary hospitals in the country.  In return for these contributions the Mater hospital assumes the liability for CRC staff members' pension payments as and when they fall due, thus relieving the CRC of future pension payments to its employees.  I would like at this point to make clear that the Mater hospital receives no payment for this service to the CRC.<\/p><p>  In relation to the pension mechanism, the scheme is in line with public sector pension policy, whereby all pensions are funded from current revenues, namely, no specific ongoing fund is built up for future pension payments.  Further, while the Mater hospital administers all payments through the scheme, the HSE's pension section in Manorhamilton authorises the authenticity of payments.<\/p><p>  To respond to the question as to the reason the Department of Health directed the Mater hospital to undertake this scheme on behalf of the CRC, I need to take the committee back in time.  The CRC had been in operation for a number of years when it sought Department of Health funding in the mid-1970s.  However, for technical and legal reasons, the Department of Health at the time could not provide any funding to the CRC as it was not a hospital.  To overcome this difficulty, it was decided that all funding for the CRC should be provided through a voluntary hospital.  The Mater hospital being the nearest hospital to the CRC, with joint clinical commitments and through the Sisters of Mercy, provided significant support to the clinic and was, therefore, chosen to be the channel for such funding.<\/p><p>  In 1977, the Mater hospital requested permission from the Department of Health to admit the CRC staff into the VHSS.  These letters of January and August 1979 have been supplied to the committee.  The Department of Health gave permission to the Mater hospital to enrol the requested CRC staff to the VHSS on the basis that funding for the clinic was processed through the hospital.  This is articulated in the August 1979 letter from the Department of Health.  Further correspondence to the CRC dated 2 November 2004 is a latter from Patsy Carr to the CRC from the pension policy unit in the Department of Health again reaffirming the arrangement in place with the Mater hospital.  It also confirms that the CRC did not qualify to administer its own VHSS and that the Department of Health was satisfied for the arrangement to continue.<\/p><p>  I refer finally to the correspondence from the pensions unit in the Department of Health to Mr. Paul Kiely, then chief executive of the CRC in May 2010, which again reaffirms the pension arrangement between the Mater hospital and the CRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900007#F01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Day"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387449900,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I have provided supporting documentation for this which I trust will give the Chairman and members of the committee an understanding of why the Mater hospital has responsibility for the pension scheme for approximately 180 staff members at the CRC and, most important, that the Mater hospital is not paid for this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900008#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Day"},{"type":"speech","time":1387449900,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Does this mean everything is in order with the pension scheme?

They put their hands in that pot and put it into their own pockets.  That did the most damage throughout this controversy.  It has been very useful to have Ms Day and Mr. O'Brien here today to provide clarification on this.<\/p><p>  This comes back to the broader issue of corporate governance in section 38 agencies and gives us a real insight into the chaos in the sector where a board of directors is signing off on accounts and submitting them to the Companies Registration Office in a go-along-to-get-along mentality and then crying foul over something in the accounts.  This never would have come up if Deputy Ross had not been quoting directly from the audited accounts that were submitted to the Companies Registration Office.  The auditors have significant questions to answer.  Mr.  Conlan, who was CEO of the Mater Hospital before Ms Day, was on the board of the CRC at the time and should have been extremely well placed.  When he comes before us in January I hope he can cast more light on this regarding what was going on at board meetings that inaccurate accounts were submitted to the Companies Registration Office.  Directors have a legal obligation under company law to provide a true and fair view in their accounts of the company's activities.  Mr. Conlan could cast some light on the fact that the directors were signing off on accounts and that audited accounts were being submitted that clearly were not true or fair in the case of the pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900012#L01100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1387452300,"counter":240,"content":"<p>To close this part of our meeting and go to Dr. McLoughlin, we will write to the directors of the CRC who were there at that time, Mr. Kiely and EY, along the lines of what Deputy Fleming suggested.

I thank the Chairman for acknowledging that the public health and social service system is hugely reliant on the contribution of organisations funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  Like the Chairman, I recognise the contribution made by the 35,000 dedicated staff and supporters of these organisations, which is highly valued.  It is important to stress that the vast majority of staff in these organisations are paid in accordance with the Department of Health's approved salary scales.  These staff are working within Government pay policy and have taken pay cuts while also playing their part in the reform of our health services through new working practices and co-operation with structural reforms.  I wish, therefore, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Department of Health, to acknowledge the high quality care, support, services and treatment that these organisations have delivered for many decades, and continue to provide, to a wide range of patients and clients.<\/p><p> I would like to acknowledge the excellent work of the HSE in carrying out this comprehensive internal audit.  For the first time and, despite efforts over a number of years, this exercise has succeeded in eliciting a much greater level of information on the remuneration arrangements in the section 38 organisations than had previously been obtained.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, initiated, through me as chairman of the HSE and then CEO of the HSE, the investigative process arising from the HIQA report on Tallaght in May 2012.  The HSE conducted an audit of all section 38 recipients.  As a result of this audit, a considerable number of funding recipients have been found to be in breach of Government pay policy in regard to the remuneration of their senior staff.<\/p><p> In response to the findings of the HSE's internal audit report, and following consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health drew up a pay policy for the health service, with a particular focus on the section 38 organisations.  This pay policy was issued to the HSE on 27 September 2013.  The pay policy states clearly that section 38-funded agencies may not supplement approved rates of remuneration with Exchequer funding or non-Exchequer sources of funding.  The HSE has taken decisive action to implement the terms of this pay policy and is keeping the Minister and Department of Health briefed on developments.  The executive has a team of senior managers working with all of the organisations and hospitals concerned to ensure that a clear plan to achieve full compliance with health sector pay policy is developed by each agency.  As set out in the Department's pay policy, if an organisation wishes to make a business case for the continuation of an unapproved allowance, it is open to it to do so and any such cases will be considered by the HSE, with the involvement of the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as necessary.<\/p><p> I understand that the HSE is also instituting a new requirement in relation to an annual compliance statement, which will have to be approved by the board of each agency on an annual basis, signed by the chairman and another director on behalf of the board and submitted to the HSE together with the organisation's annual audited accounts.  This is a major advance in the improvement of governance arrangements in these organisations.  This annual compliance statement will be required in addition to the annual service agreement between the agency and the HSE.<\/p><p> As Deputies are aware, the HSE also grant aids a wide range of organisations - more than 3,000 - to a greater or lesser extent under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants.  They are not included in the HSE employment control ceiling and are not bound by the Department of Health consolidated salary scales and are not members of a public service pension scheme.  However, on foot of the findings in regard to pay arrangements in section 38 agencies, the Department, on behalf of the Minister, has asked the HSE to write to section 39 agencies asking them to have due regard to Government pay policy, in particular for senior managers.  The committee may also wish to note that the HSE in its correspondence with the 353 section 39 agencies that receive more than &euro;250,000 per annum in funding, has reminded these organisations that under the terms of their service arrangements, they are required to disclose the salaries of their senior managers to the HSE.  Separately, I have issued a national pay policy to the health agencies under the aegis of the Department of Health.<\/p><p> I would also like to emphasise the priority with which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, are according to improving governance within all organisations in the health sector.  One of the fundamental reasons for the major health reform programme now being delivered on is to enhance accountability across the whole health system, improve its governance and to deliver more cost-effective quality safe services that deliver best outcomes<i><\/i>for<i><\/i>the patients and public we serve.  The Minister has recently established a governance forum for the health sector to support and help chairpersons, board members and CEOs to fulfil their accountability and governance roles.  We will be insisting on structured induction programmes for all new board members and a system of independent regular governance audits.  As part of these new induction programmes, it will be made clear to new board members of section 38 agencies that they have no discretion to make extra payments to staff which are not encompassed by and in line with the Department's consolidated salary scales.  All health sector agencies will be encouraged to publish details of payments, whether salary or otherwise, to all senior managers and senior clinicians in their annual reports and to make details easily accessible on websites.  I would strongly encourage all agencies to publish their independent governance audits as part of their annual reporting process.<\/p><p> I wish to endorse the recent statement by the Chairman of this committee in which he encouraged the public to continue to donate to charities.

At our last meeting we saw correspondence from the Central Remedial Clinic which was dismissive of the HSE.  I would characterise some of the correspondence as aggressive.  Ms Laverne McGuinness accurately described one letter as being told to get lost.  Today we have correspondence from St. Vincent's Hospital which, although perhaps more cautiously worded, amounts to the same message.  Before we get into the particulars regarding St. Vincent's Hospital, I put it to Dr. McLoughlin and Mr. O'Brien that despite the fact that this saga has been ongoing for many years, quietly perhaps but more recently in the full gaze of the media, with all of the attendant damage that has been done to very important service organisations, we really have not made progress in terms of setting things right.<\/p> <p>By that I mean bringing these non-compliant organisations into line with public sector pay policy and recouping those amounts that have been paid in excess of the sanctioned level of salary.  What I want to put to both gentlemen is that it seems to me that the system has been a toothless tiger in dealing with this issue, despite circulars, meetings and volumes of correspondence.  I would like to hear their reaction to that.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act allows for a process of recouping moneys in excess of the sanctioned salary levels.  What consideration has been given to using that legislation in these particular cases?

A finding of it is, as I have stated, that where there were breaches in terms of salary scales, verbal - therefore, not on files - Department of Health approval had been sought and obtained and the audit very faithfully records that there is no record of that in the Department.  I am making this point for the following reason.  When one views this in the round, we know that certainly in 2008 and 2009, there is an awareness within the system of these breaches.  We then have toing and froing and different levels of correspondence.  We are now in  2013 going into 2014 and the matter remains unresolved.  That suggests two things to me.  First, whether real or imagined, there was and perhaps still is - we will address this - an ambiguity in the mind of some of these organisations in regard to pay ceilings and adherence to them.

Perhaps it is worth clarifying what the FEMPI recoupment legislation permits and does not permit.  First, FEMPI stands for \"financial emergency measures in the public interest\".  The FEMPI legislation contains an anti-avoidance provision to prevent, once the pay cuts of 2010 and the most recent pay cuts of 2013 were implemented, employers from restoring the reduced pay rates in various ways.  There are measures included in the legislation which contain very strong provisions to the effect that if an employer, in an effort to avoid the FEMPI measures, seeks to increase the pay rate that has been reduced, that money is held in trust by the employee and must be returned by him or her.  Ultimately, if that process does not work the State can withhold some of the grant money that is paid to that individual public service body.  It is, however, specific to the pay cuts made under the FEMPI legislation; it is not specific to other overpayments of wages.  There is a general rule around overpayment of wages and recoupment of overpayments, whether made in error or whatever, and those are the normal rules that must apply.  It is not a practical proposition to try to apply the FEMPI legislation, which is specific to its purpose of an anti-avoidance measure, in this case.  There is a general rule around the recoupment of salary overpayments that applies.  Under the Payment of Wages Acts, overpayments of salaries can be recouped in the normal course.

This seems to be a confusing and complex area.  Somebody might guide me on it.  There is an adverse opinion on the financial statements.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s has publicly explained why this adverse opinion arose.  I would like to address it with you, Dr. Smith.<\/p><p>  It states that as more fully explained in note 20 to the financial statements, the financial statements do not include pension costs, pension liabilities and pension assets of those staff who are members of the voluntary hospital superannuation scheme as required by financial reporting standard 17, retirement benefits.  In the auditor's opinion, because of the significance of the matter described and the basis for the adverse opinion paragraph, the financial statements do not give a true and fair view in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice in Ireland of the state of the group&rsquo;s and the parent company&rsquo;s affairs as of 31 December 2011 and of the group&rsquo;s loss and cash flows for the year then ended.  It concludes that because of the potential impact of the matter described and the basis for the adverse opinion paragraph, they were unable to form an opinion as to whether the net assets of the parent company as stated in the company balance sheet after taking account of this matter are more than half of the amount of its so-called share capital. <\/p><p>  When I see an adverse opinion in group accounts that have been filed significantly late it raises a red flag.

The idea is that an organisation recognises its charge each year for those people who will become pensioners.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s and many section 38 agencies, as we saw earlier today, are members of State sector pension schemes which are, to put it in very general language, pay-as-you-go.  There is no fund.  The accounts of those organisations do not identify the charge for the year for the employees because it is funded on a pay-as-you-go-basis.

We carry out that audit and one of the issues we will look at concerning the section 38 entities is the approval of pay levels for senior managers.  There was an occasion when a section 38 entity came to our attention.  It was in the course of the 2007 audit of St. Luke's Hospital.  Our general concern would be that if an additional payment is being made, it should have ministerial sanction.  We do not determine that the amount is not payable.  We would recommend to the agency that if it cannot produce a sanction to us, then it must seek a sanction for it and act accordingly.  As regards St. Luke's Hospital in 2007, we picked up on that.  We wrote to the St. Luke's management and asked them to pursue it with the Minister.  We checked the following year that that had been done, but there was no reply on file at that stage.  A reply came and we saw that the following year.  It indicated that sanction would not be forthcoming for that particular payment.  We then wrote to the Department of Finance at the time drawing its attention to it.  There was a concern that somebody had full-time employment but there was either a secondary appointment or they were essentially being paid a top-up.  We got a reply from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which coincided with a lot of work beginning on that around 2011.<\/p><p>  More generally, within the section 38 entities we audit, as I indicated at the last meeting, we have issued audit queries concerning three of five audits for 2012.  I will say one thing, which is slightly different.  In most of the cases, where significant payments are being made, we have identified that payments are being made by another body rather than by another public sector body.  In the case of St. James's Hospital, payments are being made by Trinity for another set of activities by the individuals concerned.  That also happens in another hospital.  In Beaumont Hospital there are small payments.  Depending on how this plays out and the answers that we get from the hospitals, I may report further on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900031#GG00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1387463100,"counter":781,"content":"<p>May I ask a follow-up question, because I have to go?

A Department of State can only deal with fact.  It cannot deal with supposition or hearsay.  There is a letter from Mr. Se&aacute;n McGrath, the national director of human resources, to Mr. Michael Scanlon, which I am quite happy to circulate to the committee.  It clearly deals with adherence to consolidated health sector salary scales.  We have to deal with fact.  I want to be clear also because comments were made by the Deputy.  I want to assure the charitable organisations, and the people who are collecting money for them across this State, that the Minister, myself and the HSE's director general are determined to give them the best guarantee possible by following through on these investigations.  I want to be clear, however, that there is no evidence that anything other than a very small number of people are non-compliant.  It is important for us to reiterate the fact that 99.9% of public servants are compliant with public sector pay guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013121900031#GG01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1387463100,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt Dr. McLoughlin.  There are 44 agencies, eight of which are compliant.  Twelve are non-compliant and 22 say that in their view they are compliant, but Dr. McLoughlin questioned that.  There are two others somewhere in the mix, to make up the sum total, but whether they are compliant I do not know.  That is a significant number of non-compliant organisations.  I understand the assurance Dr. McLoughlin is giving the public as regards the charities, but it is clear to me that down through the years everyone in the system knew what was going on or what was emerging, yet no one dealt with it.  The CRC correspondence clearly demonstrates that.  If the CRC and other organisations are wrong or not compliant, I have to deal with the current entities.  The HSE simply was not compliant.  It did not do its job and did not follow up the &euro;2.2 billion of taxpayers' money that is going to these 44 agencies.  It is just outrageous that that would have happened.  The CRC decided that it was going to question this and the Department entered into correspondence on it.<\/p> <p>It would seem there was no willingness on the part of the HSE or the Department of Health to do this.  Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin defends the current Minister and current departmental officials.  That is not why he is here.  He is here because of what happened from 1996 onwards.  I know neither Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin nor Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Brien were in their current positions then but we have to account for it.  We have to put in place a system that will account for the taxpayers&rsquo; money.<\/p><p> From the time this matter with the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, was highlighted in 2009, nothing was done until now.  There may have been a bit of activity but no action was taken to bring these agencies into line.  Now, we are faced with the consequences because there are surely contractual arrangements thrown into the mix.  Everyone in the system involved in this is wrong.  They did not deal with it or sort it out.  They did not examine the audits as they should have.  Instead, they allowed the agencies more or less tell them what to do.<\/p><p> The next big question relates to agencies under section 39.  It is shocking that the Department of Finance did not know what was going on in these organisations.  There should have been some sort of paper trail which would have allowed all these issues to be corrected.

I am honoured to have been asked by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, to become the chairman of IDA Ireland.<\/p><p>  With the Chairman's permission, I wish to take this opportunity to introduce myself personally to the committee.  I am a native of Dundalk and attended the Christian Brothers in Dundalk where my main interest lay in the Irish language.  I am married to Rose, we have two adult children, Jeremy and Grainne, and one grand-daughter, Jasmine, and we now reside in County Meath.  On leaving school, I joined Air Traffic Control and after basic training in Cork Airport was assigned to Dublin Airport.  Following the death of my father, Michael, I returned to Dundalk to work in an Irish computer company, Qeleq Limited, for a period of four years.  It was while working at Qeleg that I got my first exposure to working with computers and of marketing and, following a further two years of work with Honeywell Computers, Dublin, I was fortunate to join IDA Ireland in August 1978 as a project executive working on the attraction of overseas IT companies to Ireland.<\/p><p>  During my 25-year career with IDA Ireland I served in North America from 1979 to 1983 and was a member of the IDA team which successfully attracted the Intel investment to Ireland in 1989.  Today, Intel employs more than 4,000 people at Leixlip County Kildare with an associated investment of &euro;7 billion.  At the conclusion of my IDA service I was the executive director of the agency responsible for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland.<\/p><p>  My service with IDA Ireland also afforded me the opportunity to study.  During this time I completed a diploma in business strategy at the Irish Management Institute and an MSc in Strategic Management at Trinity College Dublin.  Both these qualifications were achieved through part-time study.<\/p><p>  I was appointed chief executive officer at Enterprise Ireland in November 2003.  By the end of 2012 exports by Irish companies had grown from &euro;9.6 billion in 2003 to &euro;16.2 billion.  My tenure at Enterprise Ireland was characterised by a focus on leadership, including the setting of high expectation of my own work ethic and that of others, to deliver on behalf of our clients and the State.<\/p><p>  I retired from Enterprise Ireland on 2 November 2013 following the completion of my second five-year term as chief executive officer.  Earlier this month I was conferred with an honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, by University College Dublin and was recently the recipient of the Innovation in Management Award 2013 from the Irish Management Institute.  In addition, I am currently chairman of the Early Learning Initiative at the National College of Ireland, chairman of the judging panel of the Deloitte Best Managed Company Awards, a council member of the Irish Tax Institute and a member of the Committee of Industry and Commerce at the Royal Dublin Society.<\/p><p>  I am deeply familiar with the work of IDA Ireland.  It is rightly recognised as the number one foreign direct investment agency in the world.  It is a competent, well-run and effective organisation.  It has deeply experienced and committed staff and an excellent chief executive.  This is not to deny that the IDA needs to continue to sharpen its focus and to evolve to meet the needs of overseas client companies.  A number of issues will arise next year.  During 2014 Mr. Barry O'Leary will complete his assignment as chief executive officer and will be particularly hard to replace.  The identification of a new chief executive is of particular importance and I intend to focus on this important issue in the coming months.  It is, of course, a matter for the Minister to appoint members of the board, however, I intend to work with him to ensure that the board always has within its membership the key talent and experience to guide the work of the agency to best effect.<\/p><p>  The continued attraction of high levels of foreign direct investment is of key importance to the growth of the economy.  In my prior work with the IDA I gained valuable experience of working with the developed economies of the United States, Europe and Japan.  During my tenure with Enterprise Ireland I gained additional experience of trade with Asia, the Middle East and South America.<\/p><p>  It will be my privilege to work with the IDA board and its staff both at home and overseas.  My goal is to utilise my 35 years of experience in economic development to lead the board of the agency in an effective and efficient manner and to maintain the standing of the organisation as the most effective foreign direct investment agency in modern economic times.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the invitation to appear before the committee today and I will be pleased to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013121900002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1387456200,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Frank Ryan for that.

We need to strengthen the links between Enterprise Ireland client companies and our foreign direct investment base, and I hope he will be able to bring that to the table.  While I have huge respect for the IDA and huge regard for the work that all of its staff do, the regional focus of the organisation in recent years has slipped.

He certainly brings a skill-set and assets to the job that I think will serve the IDA very well.  I wish him the very best of luck in his new role.  I have a number of questions that I would like to put to the witnesses, especially Mr. Ryan.<\/p><p>  My first question is about the information that we get, as Oireachtas Members, from the IDA.  It is important that there is full transparency and that we get as much information as possible.  I am talking primarily about job announcements.  It is very important that we get the information very quickly about the follow-up.  We often have job announcements but we do not always see them materialise into real jobs created.  It would be important if we could be given that information as quickly as possible and be always kept informed about progress once jobs are being announced.  I would like to get information about the number of jobs created from within the State, from outside the State and so on, which would be useful to us.<\/p><p>  Mr. Ryan's previous role will help in deepening links between the SME sector and the FDI sector, and between Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  That is very important.  If we can get more FDI into the different regions of the State, that will create spin-out opportunities for SMEs, and these very much go hand in hand.  Mr. Ryan's experience with Enterprise Ireland will certainly benefit the IDA as well.  What is Mr. Ryan's own view on how we can deepen and strengthen the links between the two organisations?<\/p><p>  I must raise regional disparities and strategies, as the previous speaker did.  I am from the south east.  We have very high levels of unemployment, which are 4% above the national average.  Unemployment in Waterford city is at over 20%, which is the city I represent.  Before Mr. Ryan came in, I presented him with a copy of the south east economic development strategy, which this committee published.  I do not expect him to know the detail of that report but it made a number of clear recommendations which we were hoping the IDA would implement.  The main recommendation was for a regional office with a regional director of the IDA based in the south east.  There should not be a director and an office just for the sake of it, as there should be the support staff and a strategy for the region as well.  The figures presented to us by the IDA are not encouraging.  There were 315 jobs created by IDA sponsored companies in 2011, while 1,095 jobs were lost.  In 2010, there were 406 jobs created and 887 jobs lost.  In 2009, there were 427 jobs created and 938 lost.  It is good that the IDA is bringing jobs into Ireland but we need to make sure that there is balanced regional development.  There is a commitment from the Government that 50% of all FDI jobs would be outside the main urban centres of Cork, Dublin and Galway.  That was dropped from the revised jobs action strategy but it is still there as an objective.  I would like to hear Mr. Ryan's view on that, on the south east and on other regions that are underperforming.<\/p><p>  There are FDI challenges in the areas of life sciences and the pharmaceutical sector.  It is an area that the south east is strong but we know that the pharmaceutical sector faces issues in respect of the patent cliff and so on.  The CEO of the IDA recently spoke about the challenges that the sector faces but perhaps Mr. Ryan can give his own view on it.  The issue of tax avoidance - if I can use the term - by multinational companies has come up, and I know it is being examined by the OECD, by the G7 and the EU.   What is Mr. Ryan's view on that?  How can Ireland make sure that we are not seen as a country that allows tax avoidance?<\/p><p>  I would like to finish by wishing Mr. Ryan the very best of luck in his new role.  I have no doubt that with his experience and qualifications he will add real value to the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013121900003#B00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387456200,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today.  Mr. Ryan's history sounds exactly like the sort of history that we want.  I would like to take him back to 1979.  I was approached to become chairman of what became An Post at the same time as Michael Smurfit was made chairman of An Bord Telecom.  We both said at the time that we did not know anything about these businesses and wondered what we would do.  My first question was about the challenges, and I am going to ask Mr. Ryan that now.  What does he see are the challenges?<\/p><p>  My second question when I was appointed chairman of An Post was about the changes that I wanted and the third question was about the conditions I put down.  Michael Smurfit put down a condition that he be paid &pound;5,000.  He was going to give it to charity but there was a limit on the amount that could be paid, at &pound;1,500, and he wanted to establish that they were willing to break the rules to establish An Bord Telecom, which I thought was very good.  My condition was that I would always be dealing with the Minister and not with the civil servant when I wanted to get through to him.  We made two different choices.  I said that I wanted to have an office in the middle of the GPO, but Michael Smurfit said he wanted a prestigious office far away from wherever Telecom &Eacute;ireann was at the time.

Mr. Ryan has been here several times before in his previous role.  I agree with other speakers on the idea of linking up both Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  We have a huge dependence on FDI coming from the USA.  The Far East now seems to be a major hub, with huge potential, yet we do not have any inward investment coming in from China.  That is a huge potential market.<\/p><p>  This is no reflection on Mr. Ryan but I am a little bit concerned with the fact that he is an insider.  His appointment is from an inside position.  He knows everybody in it.  He will be chairman of a board to oversee what goes on, yet he is probably on first name terms with everyone in both organisations.  I do not know whether that is healthy or unhealthy because it has been shown in the past that we have too much close contact.  That is not healthy for the economic environment.  I would like to hear Mr. Ryan's own views on that.  I can see the advantages of it, especially given that Mr. O'Leary is finishing up in the next year and there needs to be some kind of continuity.

The key objective for the IDA in 2014 is to continue to win foreign direct investment, FDI, against increasing global competition.  One of the challenges is to dispel the myth that exists around foreign direct investment that it was competitive to be attracted to Ireland perhaps 20 years ago, as opposed to the investment we will see over the next 20 years.  We are between stools in our interpretation in Ireland today in regard to where modern FDI sits.  Global competition is intensifying.  Many moons ago when I set out with the IDA, it was a first-mover in this area and had the benefits associated with that.  Now every state in the United States has a development agency, never mind the international competition that is there for investment.  Seeking FDI has become an industry almost in its own right.  The agency next year will finish its final year of its current Horizon 2020 strategy.  This opens the opportunity to set out a new strategy and new vision for FDI for the period 2015 to 2019 and it is one on which I look forward to working with the board, the Government, the D&aacute;il and particularly the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>  There are a number of key issues that we probably need to address in an open manner.  The first one is the regional location of foreign direct investment within the State and what type of FDI we can realistically attract to regional locations.  If I have a vision for Ireland for the future it is that we will have an international reputation as a location for the research and development of new products and services and the selective manufacturing that would go along with that and that can be competitive from the silent, as it were.  It is around that context that we need to have an open discussion and an open understanding because we tend to summarise economic investment in what I would call, to some extent,  the old ways, namely, on the basis of the number of jobs that have been creased by the IDA or  by IDA companies or by Enterprise Ireland companies.  For decades we have had two segments of the economy almost operating in parallel to each other as opposed to integrated together.  My vision is that we would have a seamless enterprise engagement structure.  We are not there yet but we can get there.  That means that the multinational companies over the past five to seven years have openly gone with open innovation, which means they are declaring that they will no longer undertake in-house all of the research and development to do with their products and service.  They have moved to open innovation.  Wherever they find opportunities, they will work with those companies.  That opens a door to a whole new relationship between Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which have invested in research and development and innovation and technology, to have a whole new relationship with the multinational companies based in Ireland.   It gives the multinationals the opportunity also to be more competitive in supplying the needs of their customers. <\/p><p>  From my experience in Enterprise Ireland, the one organisation I would hold up as being excellent at this is a Accensure in Dublin which has strategic relationships with 15 to 17 Irish companies which regularly bid and win international business together where the Irish company picks up 10% to 15% of the value of a sizable contract and does very good business.  Also, when we start to summarise the jobs created, around 70% of the jobs created in IDA companies tend to be in the large urban areas but the opposite is the case in Enterprise Ireland where about 70% of the jobs are outside the main urban areas.  Perhaps there is merit in presenting that data together as an integrated approach to where jobs are being created.  In many cases, Irish companies, certainly Enterprise Ireland supported companies, are taking on people today because they have got contracts from overseas companies either in Ireland or overseas.  It is important to understand the different and varied relationships that can exist.  An Irish company may take on people in Donegal and they are recruited to meet the needs of overseas companies but we never explain that to anybody.  We never explain the cause and effect of the investments.  There is a great opportunity for us to do that.  <\/p><p>  There is also a great opportunity for the FDI companies to effectively mentor Irish companies and they need mentoring.  The Irish companies, like the overseas companies, have to compete against global competition every day.  There are ways of schooling companies in how to be more proficient in terms of bidding within the procurement rules and regulations of multinationals and so forth.  They have to learn that and it takes time to do so.  Those are some of the challenges that I see.  The global competition challenge is a very big one and, as part of that, I would take up the issue of suggestions of tax avoidance associated with Ireland.   We have a very transparent tax system in Ireland.  When the jury concludes its deliberations, other locations around the world may have to explain their position but I do not think we will be explaining ours any more than we have explained it to date.  It is a cental part of our economic policy and personally I would be very supportive of it.  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Leary to comment on a number of the issues, starting with the patent cliff issue and the response to it which I know the IDA has put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013121900004#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387456800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>The patent cliff issue is not a new one as it has been well known for the past eight years and Ireland has been positioning itself in the traditional pharmaceutical business to make sure that facilities are no longer only manufacturing but that they comprise development and manufacturing co-located together.  A substantial amount of the IDA's research and development budget goes towards that development and manufacturing model.  The new form of pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, were winning considerable investment in that area.  What has happened globally is that because companies were losing products to patent expiration and they did not have enough new ones coming on steam, they tended to look for mergers.  I would point to two in particular, Pfizer acquiring Wyeth and Merck acquiring Schering Plough.  Pfizer was left with 11 facilities in a country the size of Ireland and overall it was left with about 100 facilities in excess of what it needed.<\/p> <p>In that case, they have been shedding and rationalising.  However, four of the Pfizer sites have already been acquired by other pharmaceutical companies.  Amgen acquired the Pottery Road facility in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Hovione, the Portuguese company, bought one of the facilities in Cork.  J&amp;J has bought another one, as did a Californian company, BioMarin.  A number of these are brand new companies and it was a way of attracting them.  That being said, there is still pressure and will be.<\/p><p> There are currently eight existing clients in Ireland investing over &euro;100 million per project.  Those, which are underway, will bring new capacity on stream.  Regeneron, which is a company that has a value of approximately &euro;30 billion on the stock exchange, announced yesterday that it would invest $300 million in Limerick to employ 300 staff and 600 construction workers, and there are a number of projects of similar scale in the pipeline.  Having run through a couple of rough years, some companies are beginning to come out of it but new players are coming on as well.  It is an important business because there is much construction activity associated with it as well.<\/p><p> On a couple of points Senator Clune mentioned about the jobs announced and the real jobs, first, over half of all investments are never announced.  For confidential reasons, companies do not want to go public.  Second, IDA Ireland is not judged on job announcements.  IDA Ireland states publicly, in all its reports, the number of jobs created.  The number of jobs created in recent years are approximately twice the number that were announced.  The message of that is there is no correlation between announcements.  There are far more jobs created.  We probably would announce 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 jobs and we could be creating 10,000, 11,000 or 12,000.  One will see that in the annual report, in our end-of-year statement that comes out in January.<\/p><p> As regards the regional office in the south east, we have a team of four staff in the south east, based in Waterford.  We do not have a director because we have 19 offices around the global - we have ten in Ireland - and in recent years, like all organisations, we have had tightness in our staffing numbers.  We want to expand to different markets and with the transport infrastructure, one does not need a director in every region.  In fact, what we need is more staff out in the global marketplace generating business rather than them based in some of the regional ones.<\/p><p> Senator Clune mentioned property.  Property is an issue, particularly large footprint property.  I am talking about property of 100,000 sq. ft.  In the first instance, I will talk about Dublin.  There has been a large take-up of large office space in Dublin by FDI clients.  Three clients alone, Deutsche Bank, Novartis and Facebook, have acquired over 300,000 sq. ft. over the past couple of months.  That is an enormous amount of space.  There are further buildings that are of that size, but only a very small number.  Bearing in mind each of those buildings can hold 1,000 staff, we would be confident of continuing to win more investments of that scale and very quickly we will run out of such large footprint buildings.  If one comes today and states that there is no office building, it will be 18 to 24 months by the time one can bring that on stream.<\/p><p> Cork is winning much FDI.  There is a good pipeline for Cork but, because of, I suppose, unique circumstances in Cork, it has one of the construction companies, Cleary,-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013121900004#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387457400,"counter":855,"content":"<p>John Cleary Development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013121900005#D00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387457400,"counter":856,"content":"<p>-----which has come up with a very good model.

I was an insider of development agencies.  It did not stop us doing a complete root-and-branch review of how Enterprise Ireland engages.  The results are there to be seen.  We have an indigenous sector now that is performing and that is increasingly fit for purpose and can win contracts against global competitors on an ongoing basis.  It has never stopped me from asking the hard questions.  Only by asking the hard questions does one get insight.<\/p><p>  One of the hard questions the Deputy raised is this issue about 80% of the FDI coming from the United States of America.  It is a key issue.  My view on it is this.  In the markets where one is strong, one must stay strong.  The United States is a market that is enormously important from the point of view of FDI, trading opportunities for Irish companies and tourism.<\/p> <p> Most of the overseas companies that have established here have a mandate from their parent companies in EMEA as it is termed - Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  We may need to discuss with those companies opportunities to broaden their mandate here.  Traditionally, that is the mandate that this part of the world gets in terms of subsidiaries being established.<\/p><p> The world has changed, and has changed dramatically in the past five years while we have been dealing with our own significant challenges here at home.  By 2030 at the latest, China will be the largest economy in the world.  Brazil is of enormous strategic importance going forward because it is the only country on its own that can feed China.  The vast majority of the oil that still remains in the world is located across the Eurabian peninsula.  Russia will heat western Europe in terms of gas supplies.  Our world here in Ireland has changed dramatically and the new IDA strategy will not be a voyage to the past.  It has to be a voyage into the future and in developing new forms of FDI with the regions of the world that are growing fastest.<\/p><p> I am delighted Senator Quinn is here.  You gave me my first job as a kid in Dundalk.  I was a box-boy in your supermarket and I learned a lot from you and from watching you.

Today&rsquo;s meeting provides another opportunity to bring Deputies and Senators up to date on important developments in the work of my Department since our last quarterly review in October, as well as looking ahead to the immediate future.<\/p><p>  The President signed the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 this week and yesterday I signed the commencement order, which means that the Child and Family Agency will be established on 1 January 2014.  The Bill has been enacted and the commencement order, by way of statutory instrument, has been signed and that effectively clears the way for the establishment of the new agency.  This is a historic development and a significant milestone for all of us who are concerned about child welfare services for families and child protection.  It is a significant milestone in the programme for Government because it is a big initiative to transform fundamentally how we deliver child protection services.  We have removed these services from the HSE and created a standalone agency with a dedicated focus on children's services and child protection.<\/p><p>  Chairman, I want to take this opportunity to thank you and all your colleagues, particularly the party spokespersons, namely, Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Troy, for the very constructive parliamentary scrutiny we have had in the development of the Bill.  I believe this parliamentary scrutiny, as well discussion with NGOs, has added considerable value to the legislation.  It is a solid foundation.  We are all conscious of the decades where child protection services were not meeting the kind of standards we would all like to see.<\/p> <p>We now have the necessary foundations in place and must commence the work of eliminating the fragmentation of children's services as recommended in the task force report of 2012.   We must also ensure, which I am confident the legislation will do, that the agency works within a strong framework of public accountability.  That is very important.  Clearly, change will not happen overnight.  There are many challenging issues to be addressed in terms of a changing society and the pressures on families in relation to alcohol and drug addiction, about which we have spoken previously at this committee, children's needs not being met and children needing to be taken into care.  The recent publication by Dr. Carol Coulter, among others, has given everyone an insight into the precise challenges that the services are meeting on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> The formation of the agency will bring together key services relevant to children and families, including child protection and welfare services currently operated by the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The agency will be tasked with achieving a new strategic focus, better management and consistency of approach so as to deliver a world-class Irish service model of child welfare and protection.  It will also have statutory responsibility - this was a feature of our discussions - for ensuring that every child in the State either attends school or receives a certain minimum education.  This responsibility currently comes within the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board.  The challenge now is implementation.  The budgetary parameters have been set out in this week&rsquo;s Revised Estimates.  I am now in a position to finalise and formally notify the agency of its first allocation.  As members will be aware, careful planning has been under way for some months now.  This is the largest public sector reform ever undertaken by a Government.  The agency will have 4,000 staff and a budget of &euro;600 million.  I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the work of the staff of my Department, led by the secretary general, Mr. Jim Breslin, on this process.  An enormous amount of work has been done at every level, including at HR level in terms of engagement with the unions and staff.  A huge implementation plan has been put in place.  In terms of accountancy, a separate budget has been put in place for the agency.  One can only imagine the task it has been to separate out that budget from the HSE.  In my view it has been done effectively and efficiently.  As this work often goes unnoticed I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff for their time and effort in implementing the plan to ensure transition to the new agency on 1 January 2014. <\/p><p> The board of the Family Support Agency, which I appointed in September 2013, chaired by Ms. Norah Gibbons, will be, from 1 January 2014, the board of the new Child and Family Agency.  Early in 2014 I will set out the performance framework for the agency, which will form the basis of its first corporate plan.  The performance framework is intended to communicate the overarching values, priorities, activities and resources within which the Department will assess and track the agency&rsquo;s performance.  No doubt we will have an opportunity to discuss that during a meeting of this committee.  This process will give transparency to the Government&rsquo;s expectations for service delivery, identify changes in policy, set key service improvement priorities and create a demand for accountability for the delivery of the services in line with principles, quality standards and the resources allocated.  I will keep members informed of these developments as they progress in the new year.  During the course of passage of the legislation there was much discussion on issues such as performance and accountability, the need for reporting to the Minister and the setting of priorities.<\/p><p> The preschool quality agenda has been a topic of considerable concern within this committee.  There are currently almost 2,000 preschool inspection reports now online.  I have brought forward legislative changes in the Child and Family Agency Act to provide for statutory registration of all preschool services, the introduction of new enforcement powers for inspectors at pre-prosecution stage and increased penalties at District Court level for offences under the Act.  New national preschool quality standards have been developed and will be launched shortly. <br \/>Minimum qualification requirements for staff working in preschool services are being increased.  Budget 2014 includes an allocation of &euro;4.5 million to establish a new national quality support service for preschool services, the recruitment of new inspectors and to support training and upskilling.<\/p><p> We are also presented with a wealth of valuable information from the Growing Up in Ireland surveys.  I recommend that every policy maker in this country familiarise themselves with the data from that study.  We are currently very data-rich.  The most recent presentation by the Growing Up in Ireland study, which comprises representatives from Trinity College and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, sets out the situation in respect of Ireland's five year olds and shows that the preschool year has been very successful in helping children to transition to primary school.  It also highlights the groups of children who remain vulnerable.  The committee may in the new year wish to discuss the 15% to 20% of children who need particular supports in order to thrive.  We need to focus on that group.  While the vast majority of children are doing well, a cohort of children are not.  These are the children on which we must focus during the coming months and years.<\/p><p> The publication last week of a further tranche of reviews conducted by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church, NBSCCC, are a reminder of the past consequences of inaction and failures to protect children.  We know from these reports that there is now greater focus in the diocese on child protection.  I welcome that my call that these reports be published has been answered and that there will be ongoing publication in this regard.  There is more work to be done in relation to the congregations so that we can see precisely what is happening.  I have asked for a timeframe in respect of publication of those reports.  I am hopeful that by the end of next year all of the congregation reports will have been published.  As members will be aware, the recently published congregation reports contain some disturbing findings.  They also contain many points in relation to other countries where the orders are operating and the risks to children in those areas, which need to be followed up.  I would like everybody involved to do what they can to ensure that the types of improvement brought about in Ireland in this regard are standard practice in work overseas.  <\/p><p> I also recently launched<i><\/i>the report entitled An Examination of Recommendations from Inquiries into Events in Families, their Interactions with State Services and their Impact on Policy and Practice<i>, <\/i>authored by Dr. Helen Buckley and Dr. Caroline O&rsquo;Neill, which notes that<i><\/i>many inquiry recommendations have acted as a mechanism for positive change.  The committee might be interested in hearing first-hand about that report from Dr. Buckley and Dr. O'Neill in terms of their recommendations for moving forward and how we ought to be learning the lessons of past inquiries, which information is very helpful.  <\/p><p> On the area-based childhood programme, the additional areas have been announced.  There are now 13 areas in which the area-based childhood programme will operate.  I was most impressed by the coming together of agencies in regard to what they wanted to see happening in their areas.  For example, in one area in Dublin, 42 organisations came together and put forward a submission in respect of area-based support for children and families.  One of the criteria for funding under this programme was such inter-agency work.  It is interesting to note that when one makes inter-agency work a criterion for funding, organisations at local level are able to ensure this happens.  We need to see a lot more of this.  It was certainly a feature of the projects submitted.  The engagement between all of the services working in particular areas was very welcome.  We must now work to implement the programme.  I welcome the efforts of organisations in putting together their submissions.  We will continue to work with approximately 12 of the programmes in a mentoring capacity.   The first group of areas will continue to be involved in the projects.  There is also another a group to which we will provide mentoring so that they can get to the point at which they are equally able to deliver the types of programme that are being supported this time around.<\/p> <p> I wish to say a brief word on detention centres for children.  The major capital project has been officially launched and construction is under way.  The Chairman was concerned about the campus manager.  A new campus manager has been appointed by the board of management of the detention schools following an open competition and has taken up duty from the start of this month.  That is a key step towards our plan to amalgamate the three existing detention schools.  A relevant court case unfolded recently, as Deputies and Senators will be aware.<\/p><p> We are working on after-care provision and it will be included in the child care Bill, which I hope to have ready in January.  Focus Ireland has welcomed the progress on after-care provision, which we are putting into legislation for the first time.<\/p><p> We will be publishing the national children and young people policy framework.  A great deal of work has been done in my Department and with other Departments.  I have recently updated the Cabinet on progress and I hope to publish the framework early in 2014.  It is a framework for all of Government.  The committee will have noted the section on children in the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020 document, which was published this week.  It references this plan as a goal of Government.  We will work from the framework, which has three different elements.<\/p><p> Several important Government commitments have been met by the Department, including holding the children's referendum and providing for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  We have started the transfers from St Patrick's Institution to Oberstown and we have expanded the response to area-based poverty under the area-based childhood initiative.  There will be a new phase in 2014 when, using the children and young people's policy framework, we bring further direction and energy to achieving improvements.<\/p><p> I hope that has given the committee some idea of the work done by the Department since we last met.  I am appreciative of the work of the committee and its interest in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900003#B00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387446300,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials this morning.  In her statement the Minister alluded to the problem of alcohol addiction in the area of child welfare.  Recently, we had the Government rapporteur before a committee.  He cited the problem of alcohol addiction and the need for a ban on alcohol advertising.  Where does the Minister stand in this regard?  Does the Minister see it as something that she and her colleagues will be pursuing vigorously in the new year?<\/p><p>  It is welcome that the Child and Family Agency is finally in legislation.  The Minister alluded to the report that the task force gave her in 2012.  Key recommendations of that report were not implemented, including, specifically, the recommendation that the child and adolescent mental health services should come within the new agency and the recommendation on public health nurses.  Will the Minister update the committee on when she envisages those key services coming under the remit of the Child and Family Agency?  Will the historical deficit be carried over?  Has the Minister been able to secure additional funding to ensure that the agency is starting from a clean sheet?<\/p><p>  There are some issues with the preschool quality agenda.  I have asked on several occasions but failed to get an answer in respect of the &euro;900,000 training fund.  Originally, the Minister stated that Early Childhood Ireland was awarded a grant.  Earlier this week, the Minister described it as an extension of its funding.  I am still somewhat perturbed about how funding can be allocated without expressions of interest or without ensuring that we are getting value for money.  I reiterate that I have no problem with Early Childhood Ireland but I believe that the allocation of State funding should be done in an open and transparent manner and through proper procurement processes.<\/p><p>  The Minister has recruited additional staff to the inspectorate and that is to be welcomed.  The Minister alluded previously to the fact that she would be moving away from public health nurses and moving into the area of specialists in early childhood education to ensure a more rounded approach from an inspection point of view.  Most of the advertisements that went out cited a requirement to be a public health nurse.  Perhaps the Minister can update us on the position.  When does the Minister envisage moving to specialists in early childhood education?<\/p><p>  I asked a specific question on the mentoring programme.  It was brought to my attention that the position seemed to be more advanced than the reply given to me.  The Minister identified how she would implement the mentoring programme.  She explained that it would be rolled out nationally and that there would be one supervisor for Ireland and then several regional supervisors.  Where exactly is the process?  Has the Minister moved away from that?<\/p><p>  Another issue relates to the safeguarding of children.  I am surprised that today, almost three years into the Minister's tenure, she did not mention the Children First legislation, an issue she had said was a key priority of hers.  This is one of the most critical tranches of legislation and we are still awaiting it.  Perhaps the Minister will update us today on when it will come before the committee and when we can expect to see it going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to detention schools for children.  The Hogan judgment relates to people's entitlement to remission.  What plans does the Department have in place to meet the judgment?  Perhaps the Minister could update the committee on that.<\/p><p>  The Minister alluded to the children's rights referendum, which we all worked on and supported.  The referendum is over 12 months past.  I gather there is a further challenge to the result in the judicial system.  Does the Minister have any indication of when we will be in a position to bring forward the legislation to give effect to the referendum?  I suspect the Minister will not answer the question, but it is disappointing that 12 months on from when the people cast their vote, the result has not materialised.  The reason it has not happened is that at the time a mistake was made by the Government in publishing documentation that was clearly in breach of the McKenna judgment.  The children of Ireland are paying the price for that today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900005#D00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1387446300,"counter":886,"content":"<p>To get off on a better note, I take the opportunity to wish the Minister and her officials a very happy Christmas.  It is most important that we have the child and family agency ready to roll from the beginning of the new year.  It is, without question and as the Minister has described, historic.  It will live up to that, I have no doubt, over the years ahead.<\/p><p>  At the conclusion of the legislation in the D&aacute;il, I wished all those involved well in their respective roles and responsibilities, including Norah Gibbons and Gordon Jeyes.  Have all the board positions been filled?  With the Minister confirm whether that is the case?  We should give the new agency the opportunity to settle in.  I have no doubt there are many things I could ask, but we need to give the agency a period to settle in and then the more searching questions can apply.  I wish the agency well in the major undertaking that it is now embarking on.<\/p><p>  I received responses to specific questions I tabled in advance of today's quarterly meeting.  I wish to ask some brief questions regarding the ongoing address of the issue of the children of the Roma families taken into care in Dublin and Athlone.<\/p> <p>The Minister has indicated in her response that she has received reports on each case from the HSE's child and family services.  I presume they have been authored or signed off on by Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  Will the Minister clarify this regarding the Dublin and Athlone cases?  She has advised that the reports have been furnished, in turn, to the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, whose investigation is ongoing.  Will the Minister indicate when she expects Ms Logan to publish her report?  Do we have any idea of the timeframe Ms Logan has indicated she will require in order to complete her investigations and publish her report, including any recommendation she might make?  This important matter has not only attracted domestic attention but also international attention.  I am mindful of the fact that people are looking at this issue because we are conscious of the backdrop to these cases on the European stage.  I am anxious that we continue to pursue that matter for all the right reasons.<\/p><p> As regards attempts by adopted persons to trace their birth mother or birth parents, as the case may be, the Minister has indicated that the HSE is in the process of reorganising the information and tracing system to allocate social work resources countrywide in a way that will allow for reduced waiting times.  There are serious disparities in the experiences of many such persons.  How far on is the HSE in organising information given to it by a raft of organisations, including religious and secular institutions?  The list is substantial, as the Minister said.  It is welcome that this information has now been placed in the State's hands and that the HSE is progressing its reorganisation.  What change, if any, can adopted persons expect in the HSE's management of these files, compared to the regimes that had that information in their care during all these years?  Can we expect an improvement in the position for adopted persons who are anxious to trace their birth mother or birth parents, as the case may be?<\/p><p> The Minister has also indicated that she is continuing with her preparations on the heads of the adoption information and tracing Bill.  She has said she is anxious to bring the heads of the Bill to the Government at the earliest possible date.  Will she indicate when she expects to bring them before the Government?  Will she publish them?  When does she expect the Bill to be published?  Will we see sight of it in the first six months of 2014?<\/p><p> My last question concerns the closure of the Rath na n&Oacute;g care centre.  I do not intend to labour the point, but Question No. 24 continues to be an issue of some concern to me.  I have received correspondence from Mr. Jeyes in this regard and will be addressing the matter directly with him, I hope early in the new year.  I wrote to the Minister about it and expressed my concerns about the directive to close down the facility.  The directive was issued from the national office.  Despite the fact that we have had a meeting since, I advise the Minister and Mr. Breslin that I have received no response to the Minister's correspondence to me.  That is a matter of concern to me.<\/p><p> I am also concerned that I have received correspondence from Mr. Jeyes following comments I made in public on this matter.  I repeat my earlier points.  I wish everyone with responsibility for the new agency every success.  I have no question on their competency, but I am concerned.  I will address these matters again with the Minister in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900005#D00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387446900,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I also extend season's greetings to the Minister and all of the staff in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  As I realise it is not resourced to the levels we would all wish, I can understand the pressures involved.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment on aftercare services and think she will receive cross-party support for that measure which will make a real difference to children's lives.  <\/p><p>  I asked a question on the Child and Family Agency and thank the Minister for the details, which are really useful.  Such details, however, prompt further questions.  Will the Minister confirm that establishment day is 1 January 2014?  As \"January\" is stated, I wonder if there has been some movement in that regard.  I understand the Revised Estimates Volume will be coming out, but will the Minister confirm that the agency will not be burdened with a deficit from the start?  Will it be fully resourced?<\/p><p>  The Minister has mentioned a corporate plan for three years and the annual business plan.  When is it anticipated that these plans will be available?<\/p><p>  As regards the agency's budget, over &euro;100 million will go to organisations that provide services.  I was surprised to learn that 700 agencies would receive that funding.  When I saw the reply, I was surprised to learn that so many organisations, agencies and bodies were providing services.  Given that we have a new agency, will there be a process whereby the agency will state the needs it can meet within current resources?  Will it also state what it cannot meet and which will, therefore, be outsourced?  We are falling into a pattern of funding the same organisations to do the same thing, rather than taking a step back.  I know it cannot be done overnight, but I like to believe that with the new agency we will be moving towards a new business model, stating what needs can be met within current resources.  Looking at the top ten list, I am not sure exactly what one or two of them are doing.  That makes me wonder what the approach is.  <\/p><p>  I asked about the national children and youth policy framework, which I look forward to supporting.  I know that much work is ongoing in that respect and that there is a whole-of-government approach, which is really important.  This is not a departmental but a whole-of-government strategy.  I was surprised to read in one of the replies to another question that the Irish Youth Justice Service would have its strategy next year.  I wonder how these relationships will be interrelated.  We could be tripping over strategies, when I thought the idea was to integrate them.<\/p><p>  On direct provision, I thank the Minister for meeting the Seanad cross-party group recently.  We had a constructive meeting, on which we can follow up.  In the response it was said people could report concerns about child protection to the HSE's child and family services, but they are part of the RIA unit.  Therefore, from the perception of somebody within the direct provision system, they are reporting to the same people who are making a judgment on their application.  That is inappropriate because it must be separate and different.<\/p><p>  I remain concerned about special care placements, but that is an issue to which I will return in the new year.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the Rath na n&Oacute;g care centre.<\/p> <p>I have serious concerns about whether we as a country are able to meet the needs of these children.  There is a long path to the identification of special care needs, so the fact that we have a 45-day waiting list is a major concern for me, as it is for the Minister.  We need to put a sharper focus on this issue.  It was announced that the heads of the Children First Bill would be revised again.  I would like to know when that will happen so we can examine that and be supportive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900006#E00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387447500,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her staff for all the work they have done over the last two and half years.  It is not an easy task to establish a new agency and transfer 4,000 people.  In a way, it is like taking over a company and doing due diligence beforehand, so it is quite a long process.  There is a case of crossover between the Minister's Department and the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  What process is there to ensure no area falls between two stools if there is disagreement over which Department has responsibility for a particular area?  I presume there will be teething problems in the first 12 months.

I thank the Minister for her very thorough response to a parliamentary question on Oberstown.  Will interim accommodation be necessary while the new development is built?  Regarding the spending of &euro;3 million on the youth programmes in the budget 2014 and the cuts, there is not much going on for young people by way of employment and facilities, particularly in new towns, and the cuts will exacerbate that.  The Minister needs to take note of that.  When the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, ran the Dublin street leagues there was a 49% reduction in local Garda call-outs, and it cost only &euro;15,000.  If one puts in the money one reaps the rewards.<\/p><p>  On the level of inspections of preschool facilities, we should seek to ensure all areas are compliant with the minimum frequency of 18 months.  Which areas are out of step in this regard and when can we expect that all areas will be subject to inspection with a frequency of under 18 months?

I will reply in a general way on the legislative programme because everybody has raised it.  There were two legislative developments that were additional to the original legislative programme: the preschool changes in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and this week&rsquo;s Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 to address an urgent situation regarding Russian adoptions.  The Child and Family Agency Act was a major piece of work and was prioritised to meet the target date of 1 January 2014 for the establishment of the agency.<\/p><p>  The children Bill was at a very advanced stage.  It was interrupted by events in the High Court which meant it was necessary to introduce provisions for remission, as members know, and this requires review of the legislative provisions in the existing Bill and criminal justice legislation.  However, that is at an extremely advanced stage.  Some final details and any implications that court decision would have in terms of regime change for detention must be dealt with.<\/p><p>  The revised heads of the Children First Bill were agreed and drafting is very advanced.  We have had some discussions on the sanctions that will apply and have had to have much interaction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on co-ordination, which we always knew would be an issue, between the sanctions and the withholding of information legislation, which the Minister for Justice and Equality introduced over a year ago.  Our current discussions are centred on finalising that issue so that there is a perfect match between the two, because we cannot have different sanctions on the withholding of information.  A huge amount of work is being done.  It is very advanced, and very early in the new year we will be in a position to circulate the final Bill to Government and introduce it into the House.<\/p><p>  On the adoption (information and tracing) Bill, my intention all along was to have legislation that is as broad as possible in terms of people&rsquo;s ability to access information.  The most up-to-date legal advice and the European legislation that has emerged in this area tell me that there are very significant constraints on how much historic information related to the birth mother can be shared where a mother has not given consent.  There is a constitutional barrier there as well as European legislation, and the implications are restrictive.  Many people will be disappointed with that.  I am disappointed because I favour as much open adoption as possible.  People need and have a right to as much information as possible on their identities.  For the future we can make that very straightforward in legislation but historically there is a major problem.  I have asked the Chairman of this committee to hold hearings on this as soon as the legislation is ready to go in the public arena, because there will be major public interest in it.  People must understand very clearly that there is no wish on my part or that of the Department to restrict access but that there are very serious constitutional issues.  The public needs a good-quality discussion on that and I hope the committee will be able to facilitate it.  The heads of that Bill will go to committee in the new year and the committee will decide how to proceed.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy made a number of points, one of which was on the development of the child and family agency.  The task force gave us a vision and we had to decide how to proceed.  I have already gone into much detail about the agencies that will come under the new child and family agency on 1 January 2014.  Protocols will have to be agreed to outline very clearly the relationship between the new agency and the mental health services and public health nurses, and there must be a very close relationship between them.  Members will appreciate the amount of negotiation that has already taken place on the transition.  Exactly what elements of those services should ideally transfer to the agency will require detailed discussion and negotiation, and there are very different views on it.  For example, some people working in the child and adolescent mental health area feel those services need to be aligned mostly with adult psychiatry as opposed to children&rsquo;s services in a child and family agency.  I believe there must be a very close working relationship between those child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the agency if we are to give the best services to children and families.<\/p> <p>Last week I met many of the agencies and advocacy groups working in this area to discuss these issues.  We have a long way to go in terms of key working relationships.  Some good progress is being made.  There are some very good initiatives regarding children in care who are being worked with by the adolescent mental health services.  The mental health services can work with the new agency in a range of ways, including consultation and direct service, but the young people in contact with the new agency should have very quick access to mental health services and must be a priority for the mental health services.<\/p><p> This links to another question Senator van Turnhout asked about how we will align priorities between the new agency and other services.  We will need protocols to begin with about the relationships.  I am trying to bring in all the services that were recommended in the first instance.  It was felt that would involve a great deal of negotiation with the nursing associations and all the other bodies involved.  In terms of the scale of the agency we decided the appropriate way was to proceed in the manner in which we have done.  We will be very closely examining the relationship between the agency and the public health nurses and will begin to examine how we can move forward in terms of closer co-operation, new protocols and, perhaps, seeing closer links between the two agencies.  We should return to this because, following on from my meeting with the advocacy groups, representatives of CAMHS and other mental health services and the HSE last week, there are some very interesting initiatives and ways forward we can develop in the meantime.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the issue on the grant to Early Childhood Ireland on a number of occasions.  It is very common for Departments to allocate grants to various organisations and it has started that training.  I have given a detailed reply on mentoring.  Some thinking has been done within the Department as to how this service might be organised.  We envisage a national service with mentors assigned to geographic areas.  The Department will be consulting key stakeholders, including Pobal, the child and family agency, the city and county child care committees and the wider sector, in the coming weeks.  We will do a round table discussion with all those stakeholders to get their best thinking on how this service should be delivered.  It should be a national service with a fair geographic spread.  It also means some of the people who have done further training in child care will get opportunities to use that training in developing and professionalising the services.<\/p><p> Members asked about the 2014 budget allocation.  The 2014 allocation will have to do solely with 2014 expenditure and will not have to address historic deficits.  The Revised Estimates were published yesterday and it will be &euro;602 million in current and &euro;7 million in capital.  From 1 January 2014 the board will have 30 days to submit a business plan for the Minister's consideration.  Early in the new year I will set out the three year performance framework, following which the board will develop a three year corporate plan.  That is laid out in legislation.  There are many demands on the services, as we know.  There are proportionately more children in the population and more children coming into care.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy began his contribution by speaking about alcohol and addiction issues.  The number of young children coming into care from families where addiction is a very serious issue is very striking.  The same is happening in the UK.  The UK legislation is very strong on giving those children a second chance as opposed to constantly returning them to families where there are serious addiction issues.  We must examine very seriously the best interests of the child in many of these situations and see what decision, from both a court point of view and a practice point of view, gives these children the best opportunity.  Some children are in very difficult situations where child care services are helping by keeping them in the service for most of the day and in the evening returning them to families struggling with addiction.  There are concerns and those cases must be followed very carefully.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy mentioned the current situation.  If people take court cases, they must be heard and there is a timeframe.  The High Court ruled very favourably on the situation just a view weeks ago.  Another element of that case has just been heard and the Supreme Court will give its determination in due course.  It is expected around April and the legalities will be finalised then, but I prefer not to comment as I am a party to those legal proceedings.<\/p><p> My private secretary delivered a letter to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's pigeon hole last week in reply to the question he raised on Rath na n&Oacute;g, so I do not know what happened to that letter.  I apologise if he did not receive it.  It disappeared somewhere <i>en route<\/i>from my office to the Deputy's pigeon hole.  I have a copy of the letter here.

All the board positions have been filled.  The Deputy also raised the Roma situation and the ongoing independent inquiry by the children's ombudsman.  All the terms of reference and reports have been given to the ombudsman.  It is an independent office.  I have no doubt she would be keen to get the report done as quickly as possible but we have not got a timeframe for it.  The Roma situation is of considerable international interest given their movement and the very marginalised position of many Roma in this country and elsewhere.  It will be very interesting to see precisely what the ombudsman has to say on the actions taken in Dublin and Athlone.<\/p><p>  In a reply I supplied, it was stated the number of times section 12 has been invoked.  Clearly, a section 12 is taken in an emergency situation.  That is the intention.  Section 12 was invoked 728 times in 2010, 751 in 2011, 764 in 2012 and 584 in 2013 to date.  The ombudsman will be examining section 12.  It is very important the Garda can react to situations.  The force has been involved in some very difficult situations where emergency action was needed for children.  I look forward to receiving the ombudsman's report.  It is very important we examine precisely what happened and the interaction between the Garda and HSE.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised a number of questions on adoption information and training.  I have given as much information as I have on the records.  The Deputy raised a very relevant point on access.  The HSE is dealing with this.  Priority is being given to gathering all the records together, which is the first step.  The service people can expect is the key question.  The HSE is examining what allocation of social workers it can make.  This is an extremely busy time for the child and family agency coming into being but I will get some extra information and find out how it intends to develop the service.  It must take its place in a long list of priorities in this time of change.<\/p><p>  It has not been satisfactory.  I have heard some very unsatisfactory personal experiences from people trying to get information.  We need to offer a professional service but there is quite an amount of work involved in bringing together tens of thousands of files that have been scattered throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The new legislation will provide a statutory basis for this work, which has commenced.  There are many files in varying states and there is huge archival work to be done to make them readily accessible.  No doubt, as this is an issue critical to individuals, it is one to which we will return.  I will try to ascertain what priority the HSE is giving to this process and how it sees it developing in the new year.  I hope that will be helpful and that I have responded to all of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions.<\/p><p> On Senator van Turnhout's questions, I have clarified the issue in relation to the budget.  The Senator made the point that &euro;100 million is allocated from the child and family agency to voluntary organisations.  We have seen in recent weeks the degree to which the State funds voluntary organisations.  A huge amount of taxpayers' money is given to many NGOs and voluntary organisations.  Very often, while a percentage of funding is provided by the public, the majority of it is provided by the State.  This may not have been as fully understood in the past as it is now following the recent discussions by the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere.  The same applies in the area covered by the child and family agency in terms of the &euro;100 million allocation.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout's point about the bringing together of the priorities of Government and an agency in terms of allocations is important.  The establishment of an agency such as the child and family agency provides an opportunity for joined-up thinking in terms of allocation of funding.  I agree with the Senator that it should not be the case that just because historically funding has been given to certain services, they should continue to get it.  There is always a resistance to change, not least from colleagues in the House when we make funding changes.  Agencies often believe they should continue to receive funding, even if they are not working on priority issues.  It is a key issue in the context of the resources available.  There are many parenting courses but the questions that arise are how many we can fund and where this issue fits in terms of priorities.  There is a need for closer alignment between Government funding.  It is important we move in the direction suggested by the Senator.  There must be a commissioning of work that needs to be done and aligns with the key priorities being presented to us.  If there are 40,000 referrals to the child and family agency and we are funding it, I want to ensure it is working with those children and families who are in crisis and need services.  This requires alignment.  Equally, we must accept the independence and creativity of voluntary organisations and new initiatives.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, the agency must be given time to settle in and establish itself.  It must also be given an opportunity to work out the alignments and priorities.<\/p><p> I note the Senator's point in relation to special care, in respect of which we are developing additional places.  However, this will not happen overnight.  One wonders why these residential and special care placements were not developed during the Celtic tiger years and why we are still using facilities abroad.  However, that is the reality.  We cannot magically produce places but a plan is in place to create additional places.  For the first time ever we are approaching this from a national point of view.  A person in charge of special care has been appointed.  A more co-ordinated approach than ever before is being taken to the needs of special care.  Also for the first time ever, funding has been provided for a new service which will provide treatment for and work with young people who are coming into special care and high support.<\/p><p> Engagement between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health is ongoing.  I meet the Minister for Education and Skills at least twice a year and our officials are in constant contact.  Both Departments are engaged in a particular piece of work and there a number of other cross-departmental committees doing key work in this area.  As the agency develops and we see where further co-operation is needed, we can develop the necessary mechanisms to ensure this happens effectively.<\/p><p> Deputy McLellan has raised with me a number of times her concern in relation to youth services.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that because of the additional money allocated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to youth services, the reductions in this area will be closer to 3.5% and 4%.  The agencies have informed me that, generally speaking, they will be in a position to deliver services.  The previously proposed 10% and 5% cuts would have been very harsh given what is happening in the area of youth services.  The additional &euro;1 million provided has enabled considerable cutting back on what was originally intended.  I am pleased with this and would like to see it continued next year.  I believe youth services provide extremely good work.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about expansion of the area-based childhood, ABC, initiative.  As I said earlier, 12 additional areas will receive mentoring.  This means that if funding is available, they should be in a position to deliver the type of services being developed by the area-based childhood initiative.  This is evidence-based.  Results from the three pilot projects were very good.  I have succeeded in getting &euro;14 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, for which I thank it.  I made a presentation to its board earlier in the year and it agreed to provide funding of &euro;14 million, which the Government matched with another &euro;14 million. This is funding for the area-based childhood initiative, which is in areas of high need throughout the country.  Fifty applications were received, which is indicative of the scale of need.  The projects selected will be up and running in January providing services in local areas to parents and children in need of the types of supports which we know work and will ensure they are able to avail of opportunities in preschools and primary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900008#G00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387448700,"counter":900,"content":"<p>In relation to the files now in the hands of the HSE from a variety of adoption agencies, religious institutions and so on, will the HSE or the child and family agency have governance over these files and with whom will adoptive people have to engage?<\/p><p>  The Minister has responded to many of my questions, some of them in writing, for which I thank her.  Regarding her reference in her responses to the three year corporate plan which she is preparing and hoping to present some time early in the New Year, while I welcome the support the Minister has secured from Atlantic Philanthropies for the area-based childhood initiative in respect of which Deputy McLellan has a great interest, this funding relates to 2014 to 2016 and is finite.  As I understand it, this is once-off funding.  Outlay in relation to not only the establishment but sustenance of the area-based childhood initiative will be required year on year.  In terms of the three year corporate plan, this funding from Atlantic Philanthropies will not be available in three years time but the need will still exist.  If we are doing our work, it will have expanded.  Has account been taken of this?  In saying this, I am being supportive because the Department will need additional resourcing to be able to better equip itself to meet the needs of children and young people across this land.  The area-based childhood programme has proven itself to be hugely successful.<\/p> <p>I wish the successful locations good luck, but 50 applications were made and I would say all of them are deserving.  The bus is departing with regard to Atlantic Philanthropies and we need to plan and make the case now because additional moneys will be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900009#H00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387449300,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I can only agree with the Deputy and I look forward to discussions with the committee.  As Minister I will certainty be making this case, which is why I am very pleased to see references to children, families, early intervention and early years services in the medium-term economic strategy.  We have a growing population of young people and there is no question that there are resource implications.<\/p><p>  The message is very clear: early intervention works, saves money, makes children's lives better and means they can develop their potential.  I believe very strongly that as a country and Government we must increase the focus on early intervention.  I am very conscious, as is every Minister, of the resources available.  Every Minister pushes his or her priorities and I will certainly not be slow in highlighting this need and working to have the appropriate budget so we can work with the group of 15% to 20% of children who need extra help if they are to do well as they get older.  We will pick up the costs if we do not deal effectively with this cohort of young children; there is no question about that.  Like everybody I must be cognisant of the economic situation.<\/p><p>  We need to debate in society how much we want to do for those aged under five.  Surprisingly, it has been a neglected group, given our talk about being a very child-centred country.  We have not focused on services for those aged under five.  All one has to do is consider maternity services at the very early stages.  Very challenging work must be done to ensure we get the resources at an early enough stage.  I will highlight this and will seek resources to ensure we can do the very best for this cohort of children.  I also want a focus on early intervention because it is a cultural issue.  Other countries are getting the message and we are beginning to see more and more focus on early years.  I hope through the work I am doing as Minister we can get this cultural and societal focus on early years and put in the appropriate resources.  As the economic situation improves this will become possible to a greater extent.  The best way out of poverty is employment, which is why the Government is focusing on job creation, which will make a huge difference to families as they get access to employment.  I take the Deputy's point on the ongoing work.  I will ask the Secretary General, Mr. Breslin, to comment on the performance framework and the type of forward planning discussed by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900010#J00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387449300,"counter":903,"content":"<p>We have tried to approach the task from two levels.  One is through the child and family agency, which will have operational responsibility for a huge number of services, and we must also get the strategic approach to the services correct.  As the Bill has gone through the Houses, committee members will be familiar with all of the steps.  It will start in the new year with the Minister's articulation of a performance framework in which she will set out what the Government considers to be the priorities over the coming three years.  The agency and its board will develop a detailed corporate plan which will give a strategic perspective for the agency over the three years.<\/p><p>  In her opening statement the Minister signalled that, given the mandate of the Department, we have been anxious to work at a level beyond this.  Early next year we will complete the national children and young people policy framework, which will be about gathering all of the Departments at the same table to address in a more joined-up way issues presenting for children.  We see this as a further opportunity to articulate the benefits of early intervention; to try to push this approach with the big Departments, which already have many resources in the field; and to build a case for where we should target further investment over the five-year strategy.<\/p><p>  The Department was established in the teeth of recession in 2011 and we all hope that as we move through this period things will improve.  The obligation on us at this stage is to put in place this type of collaborative process and structures and provide evidence on what can be achieved, so if investment is put in place it will be done in the right way and will be effective.  If this work is not done processes will not change in order to try to make best use of available resources.  We have been relatively successful in a very difficult situation with regard to resources and we can see this in area-based childhood, ABC, programme areas.  Part of our thinking is to get ourselves organised effectively in collaboration with others so that in due course we can further build on it with additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121900010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1387449300,"counter":904,"content":"<p>The Minister will have our full support in this endeavour.
