As indicated, I am chief executive officer of Ulster Bank Ireland, a role I commenced on 1 June this year.  Before joining Ulster Bank I was CEO of Danske Bank in Northern Ireland, having previously held other senior positions in Danske Bank as well as Bank of Ireland and McKinsey &amp;amp; Company Management Consultants.  I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Paul Stanley, chief finance officer, and Mr. Andrew Blair, head of problem debt management, at Ulster Bank Ireland, DAC.  We thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, Ulster Bank is a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and accordingly it is subject to the normal disclosure constraints of a publicly quoted company, although I do not believe this will unduly constrain our responses to the committee this morning.  With the agreement of the committee, I will read my opening statement relatively quickly, following which I will respond to any specific issues the committee wants to address.<\/p> <p>  The following are themes I would like to convey to the committee.  First, Ulster Bank is a strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base.  We provide important and much-needed services to Irish customers on a business and personal basis.  We also provide competition in the Irish banking market.  Second, while the post-crisis recovery continues there are market head winds to consider, including a low interest rate environment, the impact of Brexit and a challenging regulatory cost environment.  Third, we continue to work hard to address our legacy issues.  While we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate that there is more to do.  Fourth, we are looking with determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible, leveraging the strength of RBS and key market opportunities that exist.<\/p> <p>  I would like now to expand on each of these four points, starting with our strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base.  Ulster Bank has been providing banking services in Ireland for the past 180 years.  It is unique as the only systemic bank that operates in the Republic of Ireland that is owned by a parent with international reach.  RBS has confirmed that Ulster Bank remains an integral part of its plan to build a leading retail and commercial bank, substantially focused in the UK and Ireland.  Ulster Bank employs over 3,000 people, it has a network of 110 branches and it serves almost 1.1 million personal and business customers.  It has net lending of in excess of &euro;22.6 billion in the Irish economy and it holds circa &euro;17.5 billion in customer deposits.  Despite operating in a low interest rate environment, it continues to make good progress in the strengthening of its business.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 to date has been a strong customer focused period for Ulster Bank.  We reported an adjusted operating profit of &euro;236 million to end September 2016 and we are demonstrating steady progress through increasing income and reducing our operating costs.  Following the announcement by Ulster Bank to pay a &euro;1.5 billion dividend to its parent company, it maintains a strong capital position.  Our results reinforce our progress in building a strong and sustainable business as RBS in Ireland.  We have a shared ambition across RBS to become the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.  By advocacy I mean word of mouth recommendations that generate new business and relationships based not on what we say but on what we do and how we treat our customers.  We believe that we are making progress on this ambition.  We are growing market share in terms of flow of new business, particularly in the mortgage market, and our customer net promoter scores continue to rise, reflecting the level of service we provide to our customers.  We continue to invest in our customers and people and in reinforcing our brand presence.<\/p> <p>  While the post-crisis recovery continues there are market head winds that need to be considered in our outlook.  There is no doubt, as indicated as recently at last week by the CSO data, that the post-crisis recovery continues.  However, while the macroeconomic outlook remains favourable it is not as favourable or as certain as it was prior to the UK referendum or US election results.  We are also operating in a low interest rate environment which is impacting all banks' deposit margins and our returns on deposit funds remain at historically negative lows.  The recent UK vote to leave the EU is also likely to have a negative impact on the Irish economy, in our view, predominantly affecting exports and investment.  In addition, we continue to pay increasing Government and regulatory levies which already represent circa 9% of our total cost base and which adversely impacts our cost income ratio by approximately 7%.<\/p><p>On a more positive note however, the decision of the UK to exit the European Union has strengthened and reinforced the strategic importance of Ulster Bank to RBS.  As a bank regulated in Ireland, in a post-Brexit scenario Ulster Bank has a unique position within RBS.<\/p><p> The third area concerns addressing our legacy issues.  As part of our progress to build a sustainable business, there are a number of legacy issues which we continue to manage and which impact on our customers and our recovery.  This includes our work, under the direction of the Central Bank of Ireland, to address issues identified in our tracker mortgage portfolio of customers.  We are focused on completing this very complex piece of work and ensuring that we do the right thing for our customers, sorting these legacy issues out so that our focus can be on building a strong business and rebuilding the trust of customers, the pride of our people and the support of our stakeholders.<\/p><p> In the course of our discussion today, we can touch on any of these issues members want to discuss.  However, one area they have already indicated they want to talk to us about is mortgage arrears.  From the outset it is important to restate that our objective has been, and remains, to keep customers in their homes.  As we have previously indicated to the committee, there is a cost to living in a home.  Where customers engage meaningfully with us we can provide, and have in the vast majority of cases provided, a solution to keep them in their home.  We have made significant progress addressing and resolving outstanding arrears issues and to date we have supported over 22,000 customers who are experiencing difficulties to stay in their home.<\/p><p> In terms of loan sales, I remind the committee that Ulster Bank was not part of NAMA and therefore never benefitted from having impaired assets removed from our balance sheet, unlike the other domestic banks in this market.  As a result, we have undertaken a number of loan sales as part of our recovery, with the full knowledge of our regulators, both the Central Bank and the ECB, which have encouraged these processes to address what is a key issue for Irish banks in bringing the volume of non-performing loans in line with acceptable market norms.  These types of sales are an essential part of our recovery and enable not just Ulster Bank but all other financial institutions to strengthen our balance sheets, reduce our risk profile and enable us to facilitate lending and growth back into the economy for both personal and commercial customers.<\/p><p> We are firmly of the view that the future of Ulster Bank must be built on customer trust and integrity to ensure we are a powerful and competitive presence in this market.  Having been in recovery mode, we are now moving into a new phase of our business where we are focused on our customers and transforming our business, unlocking the potential that we know exists, investing in the future and running the bank efficiently.  Our clear purpose and ambition is to be the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.  Running our business in a responsible, sustainable and efficient way is at the core of that ambition.<\/p><p> To the end of September 2016, our lending activity increased by 26% year on year, with &euro;970 million of new lending facilities to business customers and a further &euro;810 million in personal lending.  Our new mortgage lending is up 49% compared with the third quarter of 2015, with our market share of new mortgage lending increasing by 4% on last year, which is very positive in a competitive market.  Our new service-led improvements to customer experience, such as mobile mortgage managers and secure video chat, have increased Ulster Bank's market share to 19% in the third quarter of 2016.  Our broad range of fixed and variable rates, which are available to both new and existing customers, are both comprehensive and competitive.<\/p><p> We are also gaining market share in agribusiness with a range of propositions and services to support and grow our customer base in this important sector.  A total of 34 of our agrispecialists will graduate this week from our unique tailored agriculture programme, designed to provide the best support to our agricustomers.  We have been out on the road all of this year talking and listening to business customers and providing support on everything from exporting to new markets, expanding organic SME businesses, the impact of Brexit and innovation in farming.  We have also started to offer finance under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p><p> We are working in an operating environment that is changing fast.  International and global events, such as Brexit or various EU or international trade issues, lower-for-longer interest rates, affect the economic environment and, in turn, our customers regardless of the outcomes.  We are focused on transforming our organisation to ensure it is fully prepared to meet these challenges in the short and long term.  As part of this transformation, we need to factor in the issues of strong competition and innovation from both banks and other non-traditional competitors.  Technical innovation, shifting consumer trends, changing demographics and increased regulatory requirements highlight the need to continuously adapt our way of working to ensure a customer-focused sustainable response and strong financial performance.  It is clear from the ongoing developments in technology and the customer response that products, services and distribution channels need to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that we meet and are responsive to customer needs.<\/p><p> The next era in banking is defined not just by the financial products or services delivered, but by who delivers them, how they reach customers and how they meet their needs.  Central to this is the application of rapidly developing technology at both the retail and wholesale levels.  These latest developments, led in the main by FinTech startups, pose challenges for market participants and regulators alike, particularly in balancing the potential benefits of innovation with the possible risks of new approaches.  It is clear, however, that the evolving banking and payments landscape requires collaboration among financial service providers, regulators, policy makers and FinTech companies to help foster the evolution of this area.  Ulster Bank, supported by our international parent RBS, is central to this collaboration.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I reiterate that our ambition in Ulster Bank is to become the number one bank for customer service in Ireland.  We have a strong franchise with an established market position and loyal customer base.  While the post-crisis recovery continues, there are market headwinds which need to be considered in our outlook.  We continue to work hard to address our legacy issues and while we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate there is more to do.  We are looking with both determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible and leveraging the strength of RBS for the key market opportunities that exist.<\/p><p> We look forward to continuing our progress in 2017 and beyond.  Mr. Andrew Blair, Mr. Paul Stanley and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Mr. Mallon spoke of Brexit and the strategic importance of Ulster Bank within the RBS group.

Brexit has increased the strategic value of Ulster Bank within the RBS portfolio but nobody really knows what Brexit is going to look like.  The future is very uncertain and there are all sorts of permutations, as well as speculation on what the impact might be.  It certainly casts a question over the issue of the passporting of banking capability across borders.  RBS has less of international presence than it had in the past but it does have customers and services which operate internationally so it needs to think about what its options might be should passporting rights be lost.  It has a number of licences in Europe, in Ireland, in Germany and in the Netherlands, and we are a key and very real part of the strategic options that exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Mr. Mallon spoke about last year's request of the Central Bank that the bank carry out a review of how many people were taken off tracker mortgages by the bank, or denied the right to go back onto a tracker mortgage as they would have been entitled to do under their contract.

It is a very complicated process because we are working through every individual case to understand how customers were communicated with, what their situation was and so on.  Approximately 200 people are working on it at the moment and we are continuing to add people to that number.  It is important that we get it right and attain the standards we and the regulator would want.  The final number of customers has not yet been concluded because we are continuing to work all the way through it but we will be writing to the first cohort, which we believe is substantial, this month.  We will looking to implement immediate steps to rectify the rates on their accounts.  We will continue to keep working on that into 2017.

At the same time, members of the bank's board are sitting there knowing that 2,000 customers have been wrongly treated by the bank.

Those allegations were independently investigated by Clifford Chance, a firm of solicitors, in the UK and by Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, another firm of solicitors, in Ireland.  Those investigations showed no foundation for the argument that those customers were put in on a basis that was not appropriate.  Since then, the Financial Conduct Authority has conducted its own investigation.  That process is not yet complete and the authority's review has not been published.  However, on 8 November, RBS announced that it was taking its own action pending the outcome of that review.  The Financial Conduct Authority noted on that date that no evidence was found in the review that is ongoing that the bank had artificially engineered a position to cause customers to transfer to a global restructuring group, that any customers exhibiting signs of difficulty that went into a global restructuring group were exhibiting clear signs of difficulty and that there was no widespread practice of transferring companies for inappropriate reasons.  There was no evidence that any assets acquired by the bank subsequent to that transfer were premeditated.  On the other side, the authority also noted that communication with customers during that transfer process could have been better, that there was a focus on pricing increases for risk at the expense of due consideration of long-term viability and that the decisions made relating to customers were not well documented or explained.  The final point made was that complaints were not well identified and handled by the bank.  As a result of that, RBS in the UK announced a new complaints process with independent oversight from a former UK High Court judge and an automatic refund of what I would describe as complex fees, which is the expression used.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, clearly, the review by the Financial Conduct Authority only covers the UK.  The Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran review, which was conducted on the original allocations, found no basis for those allegations and Ulster Bank has agreed.  The bank will seek to provide exactly the same treatment to any similarly affected customers who are identified and that process has started and is ongoing.  It will not be a very swift process but I do not think it will take an inordinate length of time to do.  We have kept our regulator informed of where we are in that process.  As soon as we have identified affected customers, we will be in contact with them.<\/p> <p>  I will make two further comments on this regarding the nature of Ulster Bank customers.  It is fair to say that customers that transferred to the global restructuring group to a greater extent in the Republic of Ireland were those with commercial real estate exposure versus more SME-orientated businesses in the UK.<\/p><p>The incidence of the payment of so-called complex fees is expected to have been relatively low, for no reason other than that most customers just were not in a position to meet ongoing commitments, never mind fees over and above those.<\/p><p> With regard to the question on the transfer out of the global restructuring group, relatively few of the customers transferred out of the group back into Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Blair","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I appreciate the background.

To do this, the committee wants to be properly informed by the banks.  We are also seeking information from the Central Bank and other parties involved.  <\/p><p> I will correct the witnesses on one issue before I proceed.  They give the impression that the various businesses concerned contacted Ulster Bank to ask for money to purchase a commercial property and the bank simply gave the money to them.  The businesses in question applied for a loan and the banks had a responsibility in that process to apply a stress test to the proposal.  Mr. Mallon placed responsibility fairly and squarely on the person who contacted the bank for a loan.  However, Ulster Bank gave the loan when it should have tested whether it was worthwhile to do so.  The bank has a responsibility in this process, including to the 2,141 customers involved, notwithstanding that it dumped 1,800 of them into vulture funds.  It is an incredible performance on the part the witnesses with respect to the questions asked by members.  It is shocking that they do not know off the top of their heads the exact numbers and the general positions regarding these companies.

I note Mr. Mallon's observations that this is not the most precise tool as an affordability measure and may not be the only metric to use in the longer term.  One of the issues that is coming to light in recent times is the phenomenon of people in their mid-30s who would have bought a property in the years 2004 to 2006, which is more than ten years ago and now find that the apartment, which is in negative equity, is too small to live in and they end up effectively renting out the apartment and renting a house for their family.  The mortgage for the apartment is covered by rental income and they are paying rent on a house, which is effectively a quasi mortgage.  In many cases they will not qualify for a mortgage and yet on an affordability basis they can qualify.  I believe they are caught in a trap of \"almost homelessness\", they are effectively paying prohibitive rents on their rental home and are in negative equity on their property.  They are utterly frustrated.  Has this informed Mr. Mallon's thinking?  I note he referred to the customers' other commitments, payment of rent while saving to purchase a property.

It would have had a reasonably good track record and brought some competition to the market for the other large mainstream banks.  This was a situation where it is clear there was a bonus scheme in place in terms of these loans being advanced, many of them property-related loans.  The bank suddenly came along and sold &euro;14 billion of gross loans, which was approximately 90% of the number of customers, clearly at a significant discount rate.  Many of those people have been in contact with us.  Many of them advised us that they were performing loans.  They are now being pursued vigorously by the vulture funds that took them over.  Does Mr. Blair believe Ulster Bank had a fiduciary responsibility as the bank that would have advanced these loans for which staff would have got bonuses?  First, does Mr. Blair believe Ulster Bank should have worked out those loans?  Second, what measures would Ulster Bank have sought to be put in place by the vulture funds that purchased the loans to ensure that the customers were treated in the same terms under which the original loan agreements were signed?  The problem here is that in the real world, these people are family businesses.  They employ many people.  Many of them cannot sleep at night.  Mr. Blair speaks about what is best for the bank, but what is best for the bank is best for the customers.  Will Mr. Blair outline the thinking around selling these loans, how the bank justified selling them on with discounts and the type of due diligence it would have done in respect of responsibilities to customers in that when they were being sold on, the vulture funds that purchased them would have treated them in the same fashion Ulster Bank was treating them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#P01800","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480584600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>On the first question about the responsibilities, regarding the loans themselves, the obligation the customer had to us is the obligation that was acquired by the buyer and so there was no change to the terms in the process.

The way that they are treated and the way they behave is subject to exactly the same form of regulation to which the banks are subject.

Representatives from other banks have been before this committee and have spoken about technology and so forth.  Are the witnesses in a position to say that the branch network is unlikely to go below 80 or 60 or 40?  Are there ten or 40 branches being examined with a view to turning them into cashless or machine-only branches?  How many branches are not viable in the longer term?  Many of us have applications on our phones and we do business in different ways now.  There is an element of rural proofing in terms of access to broadband, but it is not that long ago that Ulster Bank had very significant IT issues.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the bank's branch network and its IT system's robustness?

Will the witnesses expand on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#Q02000","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480584600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>At the time of that serious IT incident I was running a competitor bank and I did my very best to steal as many customers from Ulster Bank as possible.  I was ultimately frustrated in that because of the bank's very loyal customer base and the phenomenal performance of the staff, primarily in branches, to help customers.  They went above and beyond the call of duty in helping customers.  It was primarily the efforts of the staff in the branches, on the front line, that allowed the bank to overcome that crisis.  RBS has put a very substantial investment into repairing the IT system and ensuring such a serious incident will not happen again.  The technology platform is in a very different position from where it was at the time of that incident.<\/p> <p>  The branch network is incredibly important to the bank.  It is one of the most important channels.  Our customers have told us they like talking to people.  They like the staff in Ulster Bank.  Ulster Bank has managed to differentiate itself from competitors in the market by providing superb customer service at the front line.  Having said that, customers are using the branches less and less and they are using them for different things.  They are telling us that it is important to interact with our staff when they have an important transaction to carry out, like securing a mortgage or personal loan or when there is some other change in their lives and they need help from the bank.  They are using the branches less and less for the more mundane transactions like paying bills or lodging cheques and so forth.  The branch network needs to reshape to be able to adjust to the fact that people are doing things in different ways.  In the future there will be fewer bank branches in the same way that there are now fewer travel agents and record shops.  Consumers have voted with their feet in that context.<\/p> <p>  As a consequence of that, I cannot give Senator Horkan a definite number.  The way in which the technology has evolved makes it incredibly unpredictable.  There has been more change in the past five or six years than in the previous 50 or 60.  When I started working in the banking industry, there was a 1970s model of banking still in place.  Banks were still closing at 3.30 p.m. and not opening before 10 a.m.  It was all very manual and paper based, but that has changed completely in the time I have been working in the industry.  I cannot forecast how much more that will change over the course of the next few years.<\/p> <p>  All I can say is that we do two things.  The first is that we keep everything under review in order that we ensure we are giving customers what they need.  Second, we take extreme cognisance of the position of customers or particular cohorts of customers.  We take cognisance of rural customers and the impact of any proposed changes on them.  We also take cognisance of elderly or other vulnerable customers and try our very best to ensure that where we cannot keep unsustainable branches open, we at least protect them or mitigate the effects in every possible circumstance.<\/p><p>We cannot do that in the long term, but we will consider where to protect and mitigate in every circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#Q02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I saw a reference.

The Vintners Federation of Ireland represent publicans in the 25 counties outside of Dublin.  We currently have a membership of 4,000.  The vast majority of these 4,000 outlets are family owned, family run, small businesses.  Pubs must renew their licence each year and the fee payable is based on six different licence bands.  Revenue issue figures showing the number of pubs in each band and they are as follows.  A total of 53% of pubs with a turnover of under &euro;190,500 per annum are in that licence band.  Some 24% of pubs are in the licence band of &euro;190,500 to &euro;380,999.  This is 77% of all pubs in the State have a turnover from alcohol of less than &euro;4,000 per week.  In the remaining four licence bands of &euro;381,000 to &euro;635,000 there are 10% of pubs, the &euro;635,000 to &euro;952,499 turnover band has 6%, the &euro;952,500 to &euro;1.27 million turnover band has 3% and there is a modest 4% of pubs that turn over more than &euro;1.27 million.  These figures show a vast accumulation of very small businesses where the control of every element of cost becomes critical.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade alcohol sales in pubs has fallen by a third for a myriad of reasons that are not necessary to be recounted here.  This reduction in sales has resulted in the above set of statistics.  Notwithstanding these figures, pubs are still a major source of employment right across the country with in excess of 50,000 people currently in gainful employment in the sector.  Over the past 12 to 18 months we have been increasingly exercised by calls from members in relation to significant increases in insurance.  With that in mind we conducted a wide-spread survey of members in September of this year and the findings are quite instructive.  A total of 88.3% of our members have seen an increase in insurance in the past two years with 38.5% of members seeing an increase of between 10% and 20% in the last 12 months.  Increases of between 20% and 40% were seen by 39.5% of our members in the last 12 months and 12% have seen increases in excess of 40%.  More frighteningly, 37% of members have indicated that they have experienced significant problems in insuring their business.<\/p> <p>  Like all businesses publicans have many costs to contend with and we asked our members to rank the costs that currently cause them most concern.  The top three in order of concern were: business insurance, commercial rates and TV subscriptions.   The third concern may surprise people who do not understand what happens in pubs but TV subscriptions can cost up to &euro;1,000 per month.  Clearly, business insurance is a cause of major concern within the trade and we have quite a bit of anecdotal evidence of some members experiencing extreme difficulty in getting adequate cover and some of these in situations where there would appear to be no enhanced risk from previous years.  Over the past number of years we have seen a number of insurance companies declining to even look at or quote for business in the sector.<\/p> <p>  We can speculate forever as to the reasons for the current high cost of insurance and until there is more transparency within the sector it will remain mere speculation.  We do know, however, that in Ireland the cost of settling claims is significantly higher than in most other European countries.  We know that legal costs play a very big part in the total cost of a claim and we know that the collapse of various insurance companies has led to various increases in premium.<\/p> <p>  So what needs to be done?  While the Vintners Federation of Ireland does not believe that it has the silver bullet solution, we believe addressing the following measures would go a long way towards bringing a level of sense back into the cost of insurance for businesses.  Enhanced powers could be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to determine liability on all public liability claims with very limited exceptions.  In particular, all detail upon which a claim is based must be produced at the PIAB stage.  An appeal from the PIAB stage should be such that it is only on a point of law.  There should be no legal fees for either side at PIAB.  There should be a review of the Book of Quantum with a view to bringing it into line with European norms.  We know there are a significant number of fraudulent claims and there should be enhanced penalties for people found guilty of bringing fraudulent claims.  Any alleged incident or accident must be reported to the company where it is alleged to have happened within 30 days of its occurrence.  If the current position is allowed to prevail more businesses will close simply because they cannot access insurance or cannot afford it.  There is still a window of opportunity to bring meaningful reforms that will allow businesses to survive and to continue to give employment but that window of opportunity is fast closing.  Action is urgently required.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity and we are prepared to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cribben.

The Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, is the representative organisation for the publicans of Dublin.  We have some 600 members which is over 80% of the pubs in our capital city.  Collectively our members sell 30% of the alcohol in the Irish on-trade and employ 12,000 staff.<\/p> <p>  In simple terms there are three elements involved in business insurance; property cover, employer&rsquo;s liability and public liability.  The LVA&rsquo;s concerns are entirely focused on the issue of public liability covering the premiums and the cost of claims, as we understand that such claims account for 89% of all liability claims in the licensed trade.  To provide the committee with some flavour on the nature of public liability claims in our sector our analysis shows that some 71% of these claims are related to slips, trips and falls.<\/p> <p>  The LVA surveyed its members in September on their experience of the cost of insurance renewal over the past three years, 2014 to date.  The figures are stark.  Average premiums paid in 2014 were more than &euro;16,670 per annum, rising to &euro;20,463 per annum in 2015 and rising again to almost &euro;25,000 per annum in 2016.  This is an average annual increase of 21% and 22% in the previous two years.  These figures disguise the huge range in premiums paid by pubs across Dublin with many of our suburban members paying &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 annually, which is a very high figure and increasing and increasing by 20% annually.  That late bar scene, however, faces enormous insurance bills, with many of these businesses facing annual premiums in the &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 range.  One of our members reported an insurance premium of &euro;145,000, up from &euro;80,000 two years previously.  It is clear that insurance premiums are a very significant cost for the Dublin licensed trade and that premiums are escalating at an unsustainable pace.  It is hampering the competitiveness of our industry and is threatening the viability of some pubs.  We have had the shocking case with one of our members where a customer was awarded &euro;90,000 for a dislocated thumb as a result of a fall on stairs.  The impact of this claim was that the insurance premium doubled to &euro;150,000 per annum, which is not sustainable or viable.  The nightclub part of his business had to be closed with the loss of 15 full-time jobs.<\/p> <p>  The Dublin licensed trade has a particular concern with claimants having up to two years to lodge a claim.  This is completely excessive as it makes it difficult for the business to prepare a defence as staff and\/or customer witness statements cannot be obtained at that stage and CCTV footage would no longer be available.<\/p><p> On the availability of statistics, we understand around 20% of claims are settled by the PIAB and that a further 5% to 10% actually end up in court.  This means that 70% to 75% of claims are settled directly between insurers and claimants.  There is absolutely no information available on the majority of public liability claim settlements.  This is simply unacceptable in a modern economy and a real deterrent for new entrants to the insurance market.  The Government needs to conduct an independent economic analysis of the cost drivers of escalating public liability insurance premiums to bring greater transparency to the opaque insurance market and allow both regulators and the public to understand the factors and the extent to which they contribute to higher premiums.  It is not possible to regulate for a better functioning insurance market without understanding and quantifying the cost drivers.  For example, we note from the PIAB that the trends in the past three years, from 2013 to 2015, show a 6% increase in the number of public liability insurance claims to 8,906, with the average award being very stable at approximately &euro;25,000.   These figures do not support the view that higher claim costs are causing the hikes in premiums.  Others point to legal costs as being a factor, but there is no such statistical evidence available.  Absolute clarity on the cost drivers is, therefore, needed.  The Government needs to legislate for the mandatory provision of statistical information on public liability insurance claims, to include the number of injury claims; the nature of these claims; the settlements paid; the legal, medical and other fees identified; and the duration from claim lodgment to settlement.  There should be a publicly available national claims register to provide for transparency on awards, costs and claimant details to minimise the risk of repeated claims by individuals.  <\/p><p> The Government should review the functioning of the PIAB to ensure that at least 75% of public liability insurance claims are settled by it without legal representation and oblige all claimants to notify the business concerned with full details of their claims with 30 days of an incident occurring.  It should also review the book of quantum which include all settled claims data, not just PIAB awards, and benchmark awards intentionally to ensure competitiveness from a business perspective.

Average wards can be extraordinarily high.

There are significant costs involved in preparing a defence, including the time of the owner and management, in seeking legal advice, preparing the file, talking to staff and taking witness statements, all of which can be for naught.  Usually, when a publican goes to that much trouble, it is because he or she genuinely believes he or she has a defendable case, only to discover, typically within the week of the court hearing after the case has rumbled on for two years, that it has been settled without discussion with him or her and his or her views being taken into account.

It was the first meeting we had when we started to explore the insurance issue in late August or early September.  The insurance industry is inclined to point to the legal expenses and the level of the awards as the core problems while the legal people point to the insurance industry, the lack of competition and escalating premiums as the core problems.  Everybody is alluding to false and exaggerated claims as issues.  Specifically in the context of the insurance industry, there is no doubt that solvency, low interest rates and low market returns are affecting its finances but this element is not core to the business of insurance, as in managing premiums and dealing with claims.<\/p> <p>  Our first request to this committee and the Government is that there be an economic analysis to quantify exactly which factors are driving the premium rises.  Is it awards?  This does not seem to be the case.  Is it the number of awards, as in an escalating claims culture?  We do not believe so.  Is it the legal costs?  We have no clarity on it.  Is it exaggerated, false or bumped-up claims?  Nobody seems to have information on that or, at least, there is none that we can lay our hands on.  The lack of clarity or opaqueness that is applying in the market is a fundamental problem.  Certainly, no insurance company from outside the country will look into a market in which one cannot figure out the dynamics and invest heavily.  There is a very big demand regarding solvency capital requirements.  The companies will not take a risk in this regard when they cannot understand the dynamics.  An economic study, independent of the industry, is required to quantify the drivers of costs is the single most urgent step that needs to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#V00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I have to attend a vote in the D&aacute;il.

Taking a midway point of approximately &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000, every increase of &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 in cost is a nail in the coffin.  In terms of somebody whose insurance premium increases from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000, when other things are taken into account that extra &euro;2,000 is a cause for extreme concern, particularly when businesses have such a low turnover.  That is a turnover level and when that is brought back to gross profit and one starts looking at the cost base and other costs that have been increasing, a 25% increase on an &euro;8,000 insurance bill will bring that up to &euro;10,000.

In the last six weeks we have seen an insurer who came into the market and has been here for some time, which was regulated in Lichtenstein.  It has gone belly-up, as they say.  There were one or two brokers around the country using this particular underwriter.  Whatever premium they have paid they have no cover for that period.  There is a downside, therefore, in that unless we tightly regulate who is insuring them in the country, people under pressure will go to, let us call it, the lowest common denominator that will give them insurance.

I appreciate this opportunity to meet members and I will make opening comments on the Supplementary Estimate being sought by my Department.  The committee will recall that in my presentation on 22 September I mentioned the possibility of additional capital moneys being provided to my Department in 2016.  Arising from the discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been able to secure the agreement for the provision of an additional &euro;35 million in capital moneys for my Department.  In addition, I have also secured agreement to redirect a further sum of &euro;25 million of existing departmental funding which will not be spent in 2016 as originally intended.  This means that the Department has an overall total package of &euro;60 million for further capital investment in 2016.  The proposed distribution of this &euro;60 million is an additional &euro;1 million to support local enterprise offices, LEOs, and &euro;10 million to Microfinance Ireland, MFI.  My colleague, Deputy Breen, will provide the committee with some detail as to how this additional money will be distributed between the LEOs and Microfinance Ireland, MFI.  The remaining &euro;49 million of the investment package will be directed at research and development supports, with significant additional capital funding to Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the programme for research in third level institutes, PRTLI, and Ireland's involvement in the European Space Agency's research and development programmes.  SFI will be provided with an additional &euro;27 million, thereby bringing its overall capital investment in 2016 to &euro;184 million.  This is the highest ever level of capital investment by the foundation in a single year.<\/p><p>This additional capital money will allow SFI to fund the acquisition of critically needed research equipment across each of the seven universities and also assist a number of other research bodies such as Teagasc, Waterford IT, Tyndall National Institute and the Royal College of Surgeons.  The acquisition of this vital equipment will directly support research in key strategic areas, such as medical devices, immunology, agrifood, drug delivery, etc.<\/p><p> Through the programme for research in third level institutions, the Supplementary Estimate will allow for an additional &euro;20 million to be provided to meet the State's commitments under the PRTLI programme.  The PRTLI operates in cycles of funding of typically five to six years.  The current cycle, cycle five, was initiated in 2011 and involved a total of &euro;350 million in awards to higher education institutes, spanning 33 distinct projects.  The State committed &euro;290 million with the remaining &euro;60 million coming from private moneys.  The provision of the additional &euro;20 million will now allow the State to accelerate the timescale from meeting its outstanding commitments under PRTLI cycle five.  This in turn will help in progressing the plans for launching cycle six, which are actively being worked on by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p><p> Finally, the remaining additional &euro;2 million provided for in the package will be invested in a number of specific European Space Agency programmes.  These investments will essentially help to meet liabilities in respect of contracts which are in the process of being placed with Irish companies.  My Department's investment in the ESA programmes will total more than &euro;19 million this year.  Ireland derives from it a number of concrete benefits for our economy, including a fourfold increase in commercial sales by Irish companies involved in the high-tech space sector, with sales amounting to &euro;75 million in 2015 and employment in ESA supported companies in Ireland increasing from 1,300 in 2008 to 2,000 in 2014.  Employment is expected to double to more than 5,000 by 2020.  It is fair to say that capital investment through the Department's innovation programme has played a significant part in ensuring that Ireland is recognised as a leading research performing nation.  This is borne out by a rapid ascent in the accepted international scientific rankings, where we are now ranked in the top ten of leading research performing nations in the world.  These additional innovation supports concretely demonstrate that Ireland is committed to punching above its weight as a research and development performing nation.  It also ensures that research and development can continue to be a significant element of Ireland's offering in terms of attracting mobile foreign direct investment.<\/p><p> With the Chairman's agreement, I now invite my colleague to provide the committee with some details of the LEO offices and Microfinance Ireland elements to the Supplementary Estimate package.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#A00600","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I, too, am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the details of the Department's 2016 Supplementary Estimate.  As advised by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, I propose to provide members of the committee with details of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the Microfinance Ireland elements of the Supplementary Estimate package, which are both supported under the jobs and enterprise development programme of the Department's Vote.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to provide the local enterprise offices with an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding in 2016, thereby bringing total capital investment in these offices to &euro;19.5 million by year end.  The additional capital investment will be directed at LEOs which have signalled that they have a pipeline of ready made projects for investment.  The 14 LEOs concerned anticipate that these projects will support the creation of more than 100 jobs across the regions.  Members of the committee will be well acquainted with the valuable work done by the local enterprise offices and the undertakings of their respective regions.  The LEOs job performance since their establishment in 2014 has been remarkable.  Their performance to date in 2016 indicates a continuation of this strong jobs creation momentum.  The initial capital allocation of &euro;18.5 million in 2016 allowed the LEOs to target and approve 900 projects for grant support with an associated full-time equivalent jobs total of 1,500 for the full year.  At the end of October, more than &euro;13 million had been approved in grant supports for 747 projects across the LEO network, with more than 1,400 jobs associated with these approvals.  The additional &euro;1 million in capital funding, being provided through the Supplementary Estimate package, will ensure that this impressive performance of job delivery across the regions can continue to be built on.<\/p> <p>  As regard Microfinance Ireland, the Supplementary Estimate package will allow for a further tranche of capital investment of &euro;10 million into the microenterprise loan fund, as was envisaged under the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012.  The MFI fund is an important point of access to finance for many microenterprises.  While it took some time to establish its brand, MFI has performed impressively well in the past 18 months to two years and so far it has helped to create or sustain 2,232 jobs across the regions.  The &euro;10 million being allocated through the Supplementary Estimate package is required now to support the ongoing work of the fund for a further five years.  A further tranche of investment will be supplemented by additional financial support from the three main banks to the tune of &euro;15 million in the next five years.  The additional capital will be used to grow the level of the fund and ensure that MFI supports as many microenterprises as possible in terms of meeting their credit needs.<\/p> <p>  I hope the foregoing is of assistance to the members of the committee in regard to the rationale underlying the distribution of the proposed Supplementary Estimate package, particularly in so far as the local enterprise offices and Microfinance Ireland programmes are concerned.  I have no doubt that the additional capital investment in these programmes will significantly enhance their capacity to continue the related important challenges of providing steady access to finance to our SME community and stimulating job creation across the regions.<\/p> <p>  I will be delighted to answer questions on those two areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#B00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, for his statement.

I agree with the comments that local enterprise offices have had a very positive impact.  Would it be possible to be furnished with a schedule of the entire list of projects which are to be funded and have been funded to date by the local enterprise offices?  <\/p> <p>  Similarly in regard to the funding of the entire &euro;60 million package, capital savings have arisen from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and INTERREG.  I have had a number of direct engagements with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the past number of days and they have also appeared before the committee as part of the exercise on Brexit.  In fairness to both organisations, they are doing their best to prepare the country and the client companies they support for the onset of Brexit.  Apart from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, what all the stakeholder groups, IBEC, the cross-Border representative groups, and the Small Firms Association are flagging is that Brexit will have a big impact on the first half of next year.  In particular, we might see some SMEs relocating to a sterling based jurisdiction to equalise their cost base.<\/p><p>We are bracing ourselves for an impact next year.  Will the fact of the capital savings make an impact on Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in terms of what they are trying to roll out?  I appreciate they have been given additional resources in other parts of the budget to hire additional people, and that is welcome.  They have indicated to us that they are still waiting for the official follow through in terms of how it will be divided up between the two organisations.  Will the Minister or Minister of State give us a list of the LEOs and an oversight of what they think about whether Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will be hamstrung by virtue of these savings being used?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#B00400","speaker":"1221","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for his question and particularly his support for the local enterprise offices throughout the country.  They have played a very important role in our economic recovery, as the Deputy knows.  In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I am in the process of visiting many of the LEOs throughout the country.  I will be in Donegal next Monday to visit the LEO there and to visit some of the companies that benefit from funding from the local enterprise offices.  I can name the companies that got money from the &euro;1 million.  It was divided among companies that had projects ready to go.  I visited the LEO in Fingal last night which also got additional funding from that second tranche of funding.  The LEOs in Fingal are doing a really good job under the management there.  The LEOs that got the additional funding were Carlow, which got &euro;40,000; Cork city, which got &euro;50,000; Donegal, which got &euro;100,000; Dublin city, which got &euro;100,000; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which got &euro;60,000; Fingal, which got &euro;120,000; Kerry, which got &euro;20,000; Kildare, which got &euro;100,000; Limerick, the Deputy's county, which got &euro;50,000; Mayo, which got &euro;30,000; Sligo, &euro;85,000; Tipperary, which got &euro;170,000; Westmeath, which got &euro;75,000; and Wexford, which got &euro;69,500.  As I said, all those companies were ready with projects that would create jobs.  In total in 2015, LEOs created more than 3,533 jobs, and having that &euro;1 million now for those additional projects that are ready to run will create a further number of jobs.  We are very happy with the performance of the LEOs.  With the additional funding of &euro;4 million in 2017 we intend to make sure the LEOs grow further and create more jobs.  The recovery has to spread into all regions, which is the idea behind having a local enterprise office working in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and having finance, advice and other services available.  They are an area that is very important to every region and to every county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Collins's other question.  The Deputy asked whether Enterprise Ireland and the IDA would be disadvantaged by these savings and, especially in light of Brexit, they will not be disadvantaged.  The committee needs to appreciate the multi-annual nature of the enterprise and innovation grants provided through the Department.  Typically the grants of the enterprise agencies span three, five, seven and eight-year periods.  Our enterprise and innovation policies are about sustaining sustainable economic growth and societal development.  The consequences of securing Cabinet approval for this Supplementary Estimate, which, let us remind ourselves, includes an overall package of &euro;60 million in capital investment, means that the Department's total capital expenditure by year end will be &euro;548 million.  That is the largest ever productive capital investment made through the Department in a single year.  However, that &euro;548 million will be surpassed by a total capital spend next year of &euro;555 million, which I secured in budget 2017.  We expect to be before the committee again in February to talk to it about the 2017 Estimates.  We will elaborate further on the 2017 plans then.  In 2016 and 2017, the level of Exchequer capital funding through the likes of Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, SFI and the LEOs will be about &euro;1.1 billion, which will support Irish-based enterprise and innovation.  It will also be supplemented by a significant amount of agencies' own resource income, ORI.  Typically it is around &euro;100 million per annum.  The Exchequer capital and agency ORI combined means that, through the Department, the Government is investing in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the two years.  This is to ensure we can continue to support the jobs and innovation agendas proactively and be responsive to the various global issues like Brexit, the changing US administration and all that might arise from it.  We are pretty well resourced for this year and for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for coming in today.  I welcome some of the figures we have in front of us.  We can see the further investment transferring onto the ground, so to speak, with the number of job announcements that have been made over recent months, especially in my county of Limerick.  There have been quite a number of job announcements and I will continue to acknowledge and welcome that.  I also welcome the reduction in unemployment.  The figures are down to 7.2%, from approximately 15% five years ago, so we have halved it in five years.  I want to see that trend continue.  That needs to be stated from the outset.<\/p> <p>  On the further investment, particularly in IDA and Enterprise Ireland, the Minister mentioned figures of &euro;1.3 billion over the next two years.  Given what has happened in the United States, with the uncertainty for our own economy because of the number of American multinationals here, and as a result of Brexit, has there been a change in focus at departmental level to the Asian economies and to looking again at growing the footprint in Asia?  As Deputy Collins mentioned, we had the IDA in and we talked to its representatives about what footprint we had in Asia.  It is continuing to grow but there needs to be a new campaign or focus on Asia given the breadth of that market.<\/p> <p>  I will share some evidence with the committee.  After living on that side of the world, I know that many Asian people assume that Ireland is part of the UK.  They would not see Ireland as an independent country.  I do not want people in that jurisdiction and market to think we are leaving the EU, that is, even if they recognise that Ireland is there.  We need to get the message out there.  We are talking about 60% of the world's population.  Our footprint is quite low.  It is on the increase and I welcome that.  There should be an increased focus on that side of the world, given what has happened in the United States, Brexit and the change in the world order.  Is that becoming a major priority within the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Neville.  Limerick has had a huge number of jobs announced.  I am delighted that unemployment is going down and that 2 million people are back at work.  We cannot be complacent.  The Deputy's question is a valid one.  There is an Asia strategy being devised with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we are also feeding into that strategy.  The IDA is diversifying away from the US towards Asia and so is Enterprise Ireland.  The trade missions have been beefed up.  For example, I was on one just recently to Japan, China and Hong Kong, and the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, was in India recently.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, was also in China.  That is continuing to happen.  The information coming back from Asia, China and India is that the companies there are very interested in Ireland, they are very aware of Brexit, what is happening here and also what is happening with the US change of Government.  We will certainly be keeping a very close eye on that with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to make sure we diversify the markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned I was in India.  Enterprise Ireland is planning its trade missions for 2017.<\/p><p>Asia will be a central focus for those trade missions.  As the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has said, I led a trade mission of 14 Irish companies to India in the past ten days.  We were focused on the area of aviation, which might be of interest to Deputy Neville since he is from Limerick.  India is a big country with a population of 1.3 billion people and those responsible there are looking at connecting the smaller towns with regional routes using smaller aircraft.  This is where Ireland can help because Ireland leases half the aircraft in the world to airline companies.  I had the pleasure of opening an aviation show there as well and we met the Indian Minister of Civil Aviation.<\/p><p> Another area we concentrated on was information and communications technology.  The Irish companies were looking for business there but we also visited the key Indian companies that have a footprint in Ireland.  Wipro is based in Dublin and Shannon and Techtronics is in Dublin and Waterford.  We met the key executives in those companies.  They are in the mode of expanding worldwide at the moment.  We made a pitch through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that Ireland would be considered in that context.  <\/p><p>The good news from those companies is that they are very happy with our workforce and with our costs as well.<\/p><p> These trade missions are worthwhile.  The President, Mr. Higgins, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, were in Laos and Vietnam recently.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, made a successful visit to China and Japan.<\/p><p> We also could have a greater diplomatic presence in those areas as well.  I hope that when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reviews its footprint in Asia, it will consider opening more consulate offices, especially in India.  That is one point I will be discussing with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  We do not have a presence in Mumbai at the moment.  Since it is the most commercial city in India, I hope that we can put in place a consulate office there.  Having a permanent presence and working in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland is vital.  In that way we can attract more industry to Ireland.  We are the fastest-growing economy in Europe and India is the fastest-growing economy in the world.  We are looking forward and hoping that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will continue these trade missions in view of Brexit.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is a question of diversifying into other regions while ensuring that we continue our presence in Europe, the UK and America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Subhead B4 relates to the science and technology development programme and there is an increase of &euro;27 million.

IBEC facilitated a meeting between the president of Waterford Institute of Technology, Professor Willie Donnelly, and the president of Carlow Institute of Technology in an effort to further the technological university.

Sometimes people come to me when they are trying to start up or expand a business.  Many of them are not aware of the good work, help and support they can get from local enterprise offices.  Perhaps this is something the committee might examine next year.  We could do some advertising to spell it out for people.  A lady came to me recently.  She has run a successful play-school for over 20 years and was hoping to expand.  She had never heard of local enterprise offices.  This was the first time in her life that she was thinking of expanding and she was wondering where she should go.  I directed her to the Waterford local enterprise office and it has worked out well for her.  Anyway, my point is that until I steered her in that direction, she was unsure where to go.  I acknowledge she had never thought about making a move previously but some people have told me they never realised the help they could get in the local enterprise offices.  They are working well.  They offer a one-stop-shop service.

It was not possible to spend any of this allocation in 2016 due to certain circumstances.  The circumstances related to the finalisation of the new programme.  This was delayed due to procedural and technical issues between the EU managing authority and various stakeholders.  This delayed finalisation of the precise terms and conditions of the new programme.  This process was ongoing during 2015 at the time when the Revised Estimate Volume for Public Services 2016 was being completed.  Thereafter and significantly, when applications from promoters were eventually able to proceed and were received by the EU managing authority in 2016, the Brexit referendum stalled the process completely, as it was unclear what the position in respect of the EU refund would be after the UK left the EU.  There was considerable doubt for some time over whether the programme could proceed.  However, in recent weeks a resolution has been achieved.  This has involved complex discussions between the EU managing authority, the EU Commission and Government officials in Dublin, Belfast and London.  The resolution came too late for any funds to be expended in 2016.  However, expenditure will commence in 2017.<\/p> <p>  I was asked a question about Science Foundation Ireland and the &euro;27 million programme.

I can say that they specifically relate to the seven universities in Ireland, as well as the Royal College of Surgeons, Waterford Institute of Technology, Teagasc, and the Tyndall National Institute.

She raised a valid point.  It is a question I raised myself when I first came in to the job on awareness of the local enterprise offices.  We need to realise that the newly restructured local enterprise offices have only been in place for approximately two years.  They have forged a great relationship with Enterprise Ireland.  I am pleased the Chairman had a pleasant experience with her client in Waterford.  We give Enterprise Ireland funding towards advertising and members may have heard the organisation advertising on local radio.  As Minister of State, I travel around to the various counties.  I am focused not only on visiting the local enterprise offices but on looking at the local enterprise office companies that have been set up.  We are doing some local radio advertising in that area as well.<\/p> <p>  Under the new structure many local authorities put local enterprise offices front-of-house, although I am unsure of the position in Waterford.  In other words, when people come into the council offices, they see the LEO sign in the foyer.  They are working closely with local authorities.  We find that where a local authority and local enterprise office are working well together, the LEO works particularly well.  Most local authorities now have an economic department as well.  The three units work together.  This is where Enterprise Ireland, the Leader programme and all the other agencies come together.  It is all about collaboration.  This is the reason we have successful LEOs.<\/p> <p>  I would be delighted to invite Deputy Butler to accompany me, as Cathaoirleach of the committee, when I visit the LEO in Waterford and the associated small companies.  She will see for herself at first hand the work that Waterford LEO is doing in growing businesses.  As the Chairman noted, it is a first stop for many people who are interested in starting up a business or becoming an entrepreneur.  That is an important focus.<\/p> <p>  The LEOs and Enterprise Ireland are currently focusing on the Ireland's best young entrepreneur, IBYE, initiative.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, covered her area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire last night and I covered Fingal.  There is considerable interest in the IBYE scheme.  Last year a total of 1,400 applicants came forward and there have been 1,800 applicants this year.  The interest is a phenomenon.  We have so many young entrepreneurs who are interested in start-up companies.  We must continue to assist those young people.

When the Minister of State commenced his Second Stage speech in the debate, he reiterated that the reason the Bill was being introduced was to deal with the unintended consequences of the decision of the Court of Appeal.<\/p><p>I supported this Bill on Second Stage because of the consequences of the aforementioned court decision and the effect it would have on litigants.  However, I learned last week that on 17 November 2016, some two days after the Second Stage debate, the Supreme Court issued a determination in the case of Permanent TSB plc<i>v.<\/i>Langan stating that the decision of the Court of Appeal in that case could be appealed to the Supreme Court because it involved a matter of general public importance.  In that context, this select committee should await the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal.<\/p><p>If the Supreme Court allows the appeal in the case of Permanent TSB plc <i>v<\/i>.

It is shocking that the Department has not come before the committee to inform us of the development and that it did not communicate with us on the matter.  This issue has caused considerable concern among members of the public.  There is a massive campaign among citizens raising objections and fears as to what this legislation means.  We now have information to the effect that the courts will consider the matter again, which changes everything, and the only reason the Bill is before us is on foot of a previous court decision.  These are pretty unusual and compelling circumstances and, on that basis, I do not see any reason for the committee not to adjourn.  It would be irresponsible not to do so.  It would be viewed very poorly by citizens when there is so much concern about the legislation, a possibility that it may not be necessary at all and the certainty that the courts will consider it.  We should not get into this terrain.  Legislation that was motivated by a court decision will now be reconsidered by the courts.  It is entirely proper to await their decision.

With respect, I am disappointed that I have only learned of it literally on taking my seat to conduct the business of the meeting.

When we were in opposition, if an issue arose, we would regularly contact the Government side and tease out issues, even when there was no understanding to do so.  However, that is neither here nor there.  I see no reason not to proceed.  Other issues relating to the Bill will need to be dealt with.  Personally, I would like to proceed.

We need to tease out and consider many issues here.  As the Chairman stated, I was previously served as Chairman of a committee.

These Estimates were originally considered by the committee on 5 July this year and voted by the D&aacute;il on 7 July.  While the Estimates took account of the transfer of functions and resources from my Department to include new responsibilities regarding regional and rural affairs, they did not take account of the change in name of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A further Revised Estimate is necessary to effect this name change.<\/p> <p>  No adjustment of resources or functions is required as part of this further Revised Estimate, given that any such transfers were included in the Revised Estimate voted by the D&aacute;il on 7 July.  This means the gross provision available to my Department in 2016 remains at just over &euro;382 million.  In broad terms, the breakdown of allocations remains as follows: &euro;188 million for arts, culture and film; &euro;44 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; &euro;51 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; in excess of &euro;37 million for North-South co-operation; and more than &euro;61 million for regional development and rural affairs.<\/p> <p>  The performance, expenditure and targets of my Department during the first half of 2016 were considered by the Oireachtas joint committee on 28 September.

While I cannot accurately predict the full year outturn, all current funding is expected to be spent in full and no capital savings beyond those which can be carried forward by deferred surrender into 2017 are envisaged.

CL&Aacute;R has not been announced yet.  We will reach that shortly.  The amount there is &euro;7.5 million.  The Minister has probably sent out a circular to all sections in the Department from the finance officer stating that all bills for payment must be in by 12 or 15 December or there cannot be a guarantee of processing and so forth before 31 December.  Today is 1 December so that is a fortnight from today, and that is being very generous because the Minister probably sent out a circular a few weeks ago stating that they all had to be in by 5 December, if I know anything about what happens in Departments.  It appears awfully strange that the Department will be able to announce, get the work done, spend and validate &euro;7.5 million worth of CL&Aacute;R money between now and then, and that it will be able to get the work done and validation, clearance and payment carried out on the rural development schemes.  Otherwise, it appears the Minister is paying money on account to the county councils for work that perhaps has been approved in some cases and for other work that has not been approved, and that they have extraordinary permission from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to act as a type of bank.  That practice was frowned on a number of years ago by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He wrote a report ten years ago stating that the Department cannot hand the money over to local authorities without the work being done, which is what happened in the old days.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will recall from his time on the local authority that the authority used to get the money before the end of the year and spend it again.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General wrote a scathing report on that and said it could no longer happen, so the practice stopped.  The Minister appears to be saying that it has started again.

The second is that the Minister is having another &euro;20 million carried forward in local authority coffers.  Let us say that is &euro;30 million; we will not argue over &euro;1 million here or there.  At least &euro;30 million is being carried forward.  This is money allocated for spending on work that has not been done within the calendar year.  Instead of looking at that in a positive light, as the Minister is doing, I see it in a negative light.  I view it as &euro;30 million that should have been spent on action in rural Ireland in 2016 being deferred, by one subterfuge or another, into next year.  I repeatedly told the Minister in this committee last June that the Department was going to underspend and I asked her to sanction money then.

It would be similar to someone in Skibbereen delivering a programme to the Minister's constituency that was previously delivered in her constituency.  It is a huge issue for west Cork.

I pleaded with the Minister prior to the summer recess to try to bring about a resolution to this issue but the crisis has worsened.  There is no delivery.  There is no idea how we will deliver.  We do not know who will deliver the programme.  We do not know who to speak to about projects in west Cork.  If that is replicated throughout Ireland, this Leader programme is in tatters.  We need answers, and I have called for those answers over the past six or seven weeks.

The idea is to ascertain the wishes of those involved for amalgamation of the three islands in one contract from the end of 2017 onwards and to examine the possibility of a PSO contract.  Again, there may not be a sufficiently clear understanding of the difference between a PSO contract and an ordinary contract.

Will the Minister of State clarify the latest date for the guaranteed air service to the island in the absence of any announcement from the Department of a successful bidder?  My understanding is that the Department extended the current service to the end of the year.  I have a horrid feeling that the islanders are going to spend Christmas wondering whether they will have either a plane or a boat.  Can the Minister of State confirm when he will announce the successful bidder for an air service to Inis M&oacute;r?  Earlier, I suggested that the tender would have been to the end of January or February.  The end of the year is a bad date, because from 22 December onwards people are partying or whatever and getting all the people in one place becomes more and more difficult.  We have 38 days to go but we probably have only 14 or 15 working days.  Will the Minister of State clarify where we are going in that regard?  What was it that Oscar Wilde said about one parent and two parents?  This time we have lost two, but it seems that we will lose one of the parents for a second time unless we get a shake on things.  We have reason to be concerned.<\/p> <p>  My next question for the Minister of State relates to the Leader programme.  A certain former Minister, who now has a prestigious job in Brussels, Mr. Hogan, made some policy decisions that many of us in this committee could not agree with.  They were some of the most bizarre decisions ever.  We had divided up the country in a way such that virtually everyone was happy.  Now, we are in a farcical situation.  I hear my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, giving out with some justification and arguing that he wants a west Cork-based company to supply the service in west Cork.  However, I should point out that one of the extraordinary arrangements arising as a result of this situation is that the Aran Islands company does not provide the service from the Aran Islands under the Leader programme.  How that was done?  Not only does this have an effect in terms of the delivery of the Leader programme on the islands, but it is utterly disastrous in terms of the business and employment bases in Inis Oirr.  That island has by far the best population structure of any island around the cost because it had these office jobs that were attractive for young people to stay and rear families on the island.  Can the Minister of State confirm, in answer to the remarks of Deputy Cannon, that the Department, either through the Leader, Gaeltacht, islands or some other heading, is willing to undo the tremendous mistake it has made in respect of Inis Oirr?  Can he confirm whether the Department will provide money through some guise or another to ensure that Comhar na nOile&aacute;n can maintain employment on Inis Oirr while we wait for a change of approach or a change of Government?  This would ensure that from the next iteration of the Leader programme, the companies in these areas are those which get to win the contracts and get on with the job as long as they put in a good bid.  The Minister of State need not tell me that this is not possible.  It is perfectly possible.  I simply cannot understand it.  Humpty Dumpty would not get a better arrangement by having a company in the Aran Islands providing services in Cork and someone far away from the islands providing a service to the Aran Islands.  It is unbelievable.<\/p> <p>  I will make the following point to console Deputy Michael Collins.  He might not have known it but the Aran Islands company was providing a service in west Cork for the past ten years to the islands of west Cork.  My understanding is that the company did tremendous work there and that those in the islands of west Cork had no anxiety to join the rest of west Cork in the sense of the operation being run from west Cork.  Indeed, they were keen for the service to continue operating from the Aran Islands.  Perhaps others will come back five years from now and say the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#G00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I hear what the Deputy has said.

The Department has asked that the discussions would conclude by Friday 16 December to determine whether they can come up with a single strategy for that area.<\/p> <p>  I can understand the concern of Deputy Michael Collins.  Again, I was not aware that ten years ago Comhar na nOile&aacute;n was operating some of the parts of the west Cork Leader funding programme.  I will come back to Deputy Collins on that issue and provide further clarification.  Again, this is the local development company.  It has been charged with rolling out Leader funding.

The bringing forward of this Bill is a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government.  Ireland has designated 75 natural heritage areas, NHAs, under national law for the protection of raised bog habitats.  These sites complement the 53 areas of protected raised bog in Ireland which have been nominated for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, in accordance with the EU habitats directive.  Additional raised bog habitat within the natural heritage area network makes a contribution to maintaining or restoring these habitats to favourable conservation status.<\/p> <p>  Following an extensive process involving the examination of over 270 individual raised bogs, the review of the raised bog natural heritage area network was published in January 2014.  It set out a series of measures to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under the habitats directive and the environmental impact assessment directive, while at the same time avoiding unintended impacts on the traditional rights of landowners and users, as well as minimising the cost to the State of compensation payments.<\/p> <p>  The review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This would entail the phasing out of turf cutting on 36 existing NHAs which will remain designated.  This includes seven sites to be divided with part to be conserved and part to be de-designated.  The complete de-designation of 46 NHAs, including the relevant areas of the seven sites to be divided where it has been judged that the conservation potential is expected to be marginal or the restoration or both will be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved.  Domestic turf cutting may continue on the sites, while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems.  The designation as NHA of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, is to make up for the loss of habitat within the sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 provides for a review of raised bog habitats, making amendment and revocation of natural heritage area orders and, for those purposes, to amend the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  The Bill will provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the raised bog natural heritage area network, arising from the proposals from the review published in January 2014, an assessment of the effects on the environment of the proposals arising from the review and, if required, any other screening or an assessment, or, as the case may be, assessment undertaking, and observations or submissions received during the course of public consultation.<\/p> <p>  This Bill is an important part of our peatland strategy as we continue to deal with the need to protect the environment, live up to our EU obligations and work with landowners and turf cutters on whose lives these obligations can have a real impact.  This legislation will allow for the raised bog natural heritage area network to be managed more effectively and in a more environmentally friendly manner.  The reconfiguration of the network, which this legislation will facilitate, is based on sound scientific evidence and will have a positive impact.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is to work with the turf cutters affected in a practical and pragmatic fashion, while also working to ensure we are protecting the raised bog network and fulfilling our EU obligations.

The Bill basically allows the Minister to de-designate some NHA raised bogs on the basis that she has alternatives to put in their place.  The problem that has arisen on the raised bogs, however, could arise anywhere.  There are issues, for example, with NHAs which are blocking the provision of major infrastructure.  Maybe a similar process could be followed where not only is an individual good involved but the national good is too.<\/p><p>For many years, for example, we have been trying to build a road through the heart of Connemara and designation has been a problem.  I accept the SACs and the SPAs are virtually immutable.  However, what is proved here is that where there is a will, there is a way.  A NHA is not immutable as long as the Minister compensates - the basis of this Bill - for a NHA to be taken out with another NHA of equal standing or, maybe even in many cases, of better standing.<\/p><p>Therefore, what I sought to do in this case is to give general application to a specific instance approach taken by the Department.  I do not understand why it took the approach to have raised bogs only and it did not put in a procedure that could be applied in any case where one needs to de-designate an NHA, as happened in this case, and re-designate it with another piece of land as an NHA.<\/p><p> I will press my amendment unless I get a satisfactory answer as to why it is literally limited as a process.  If a process is in place and there are enough safeguards in it, which the Minister will tell me is the case with raised bogs, why could the same safeguards not be put in if the Department subsequently decided to de-designate some other NHA and put something else in its place?  That is what I am trying to replicate in my amendment.  Given that it has been shown that an NHA designation should not be immutable and permanent, why was a general process not put in place to allow for de-designation and re-designation of other lands as NHAs, as a generality where the case may arise and where an overriding local or national interest would warrant it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#H01400","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to speak on the related amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#J00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Each of the amendments is related and to change one means to change them all.

Presumably, if the Minister were going to change a blanket bog or any other NHA - they are not all blanket bogs and raised bogs - as she has done in this case, before she would use the law to change it, she would follow the exact same process.  Therefore, the argument put up by the Minister does not hold water.<\/p> <p>  When I was a Minister on many occasions when I went home and thought about the argument I put to the Opposition it sounded a bit hollow even to myself, not to mind the person on the other side of the argument.  When the Minister comes to do some other NHA, she might do it in a big review or in a specific review, if a specific problem arises she might follow the exact same process but the next time when she gets to the point of having a legal power to do it, she will be able to say that she has followed the process as she did with the blanket bogs and she has the legal power to do it without going back to the Oireachtas and publishing a new Bill.  In other words, the point I make is that the Minister should make the ability to do what she is trying to do in one specific instance, general, but that would not stop her continuing with the very good practice in terms of how she gets to the point of where she invokes the law.  All I am saying is that I do not see why the Minister would have to bring in a special Bill the next time she wants to make a similar change.  What we will end up with is the introduction of a County Meath NHA amendment Bill and county Connemara amendment Bill in each instance rather than saying we need to have a mechanism in place that deals with the issue, tells us the process to follow and then states that having followed all the processes, one then uses the law and makes the thing happen.

I would be concerned that it would be a potentially unlimited ministerial power without having first consulted with stakeholders, of which there are a number, for example, domestic turf cutters, the local communities and the environmental pillar.  The EU habitats requirements regard the NHA network as part of the overall picture in terms of our bogs.

It lays down quite clearly in law that one cannot willy-nilly, even with a raised bog, de-designate it without going through a rather convoluted process.  The purpose of all my amendments is that the exact same legal safeguards would apply in relation to anything else the Minister would decide to take out of the NHA.  The process is robust and within the law the Minister is introducing because one cannot do it willy-nilly.  I would not have thought the officials would have drafted the Bill in such a way, and they did not.  They have set out a very comprehensive process in terms of the amendment of the 2000 Act and the insertion of 18A.  The Bill is very comprehensive as to what exactly one must do before taking action and, therefore, a Minister could not do what the Minister just said he or she could do because, fortunately, the new Bill even in the case of raised bog will make one jump through quite a few hoops before one can jump the ditch.

I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;109 million for 2016.  The purpose of this additional Estimate is to fund the Christmas bonus, which is being paid to Vote 37 for social assistance recipients this week.  Overall, the Christmas bonus is estimated to cost &euro;220 million and, as Deputies will be aware, I am able to provide for an 85% bonus this year, which is up from 75% last year.  It is being paid over the course of this week to approximately 1.25 million customers, thereby providing a significant boost for local economies throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The cost is broken down into &euro;106 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;114 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients, mainly people in receipt of the State contributory pension.  The Social Insurance Fund is funding the entire cost of the bonus being paid this week to people on contributory payments, such as the State pension contributory, invalidity pension and so forth.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on the Supplementary Estimate, as the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  Income from pay-related social insurance, PRSI, receipts during 2016 will result in Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated &euro;9.15 billion.  This will be &euro;260 million or 3% ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;650 million or 7.7% ahead of the position in 2015.  This is a very positive development and is clear evidence that the economy generally, and employment in particular, are on an upward trajectory.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration is expected to cost &euro;8.77 billion.  This is &euro;104 million or 1.2% ahead of profile, but that is entirely accounted for by the cost of the Christmas bonus of &euro;114 million to Social Insurance Fund customers.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus is expected to be approximately &euro;350 million this year.  It will be the first surplus in the Social Insurance Fund since 2007, nine years ago.  My intention is to keep running surpluses in the coming years because we must be prepared for the next downturn when it comes and for the jobseeker's payments which will follow.  Obviously when there is a downturn, inevitably income into the fund goes down and expenditure goes up.  We also must prepare long term for the ageing population and the rising cost of pensions.<\/p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2016 is expected to be &euro;19.838 billion.  This will be &euro;213 million or 1.1% more than was provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates.  The higher expenditure is due solely to the payment of the Christmas bonus.  The live register is expected to average at approximately 304,300 in 2016.  This is a reduction of 40,000 on the average for 2015, or 141,000 better than the average for 2011.  The estimated cost of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;30.2 million is being offset by underspends elsewhere in jobseeker's allowance allocation, so no additional allocation is required for jobseekers in the Supplementary Estimate.  The improving labour market and the decline in the live register has also seen a decline in demand for employment supports.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 Supplementary Estimate referred by the D&aacute;il and the briefing provided to committee members list the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as some underspends.  We can go through the position of individual schemes as required during the meeting.  Members might wish to note that almost all of the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  Estimates of expenditure for any scheme for the following year are published in December as part of the Revised Estimate Volume.  The individual Estimates are constructed on a scheme-by-scheme basis, using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors as are available for that portion of the year in which the Estimates are calculated.  Trends can, and do, change over the course of the year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than was provided for in the original Estimates.<\/p> <p>  Actual expenditure on most of our schemes will never be precisely on target because of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.  Thus, for example, we expect a significant overspend on schemes such as the carer's allowance this year.  This is primarily due to the continuing rise in the number of applications.  In the first half of this year the number of new applications for carer's allowance increased by 19% compared with the same period in the previous year.  We are also processing more claims for the scheme.  As of the end of October, we had processed almost 26,550 claims so far this year.  That compares with 24,190 in all of 2015 and 21,250 in 2014.  The rising number of claims every year is part of the reason for the delays in processing the applications and it is also a cost to us.<\/p> <p>  I hope my statement has given the committee a broad overview of the Department's expenditure in 2016 and the reason for the necessity to seek a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  This Estimate only deals with non-contributory payments as insurance contribution-related payments are dealt with from the Social Insurance Fund and this accounts for just over half of the annual expenditure on social protection.  I note that the number in receipt of non-contributory pensions is only 130 over profile, so the big increase in pensioners is obviously in respect of State pensioners.  I do not have an objection to the Supplementary Estimate but I have a few ancillary questions for the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will recall that representations were made to both him and his predecessor regarding the abolition of the retirement pension, where people are compelled by the terms of their employment to retire at 65 years of age but they must wait a year, and it will shortly be two years, for a pension.  In such cases, many of them are obliged to seek jobseeker's allowance.  I was informed that an interdepartmental group is examining this issue to see how it can be resolved, and I thank the Department for recognising that there is a problem in this regard.  Can the Minister give an update on that?  Will the Minister also say what the extra cost would be to the Exchequer in respect of pensions if the pensions had been paid from 1 January rather than from 7 March?<\/p> <p>  As regards the one-parent family payment, I notice the work-related family dividend is 900 over profile.  In other words, 900 fewer people than anticipated availed of the family dividend.  What are the implications of that?<\/p> <p>  I note that the increase for rent supplement is just over &euro;9 million.  That reflects the change in the levels introduced by the Government.  Does the Minister have a figure for how much was spent on discretionary payments?  He will note that his predecessor issued a notification to all local welfare officers that, in certain cases, discretion could be exercised where people did not strictly meet the requirements of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to demographic trends and the difficulty of anticipating how many people will qualify, present and so forth.  However, some of the figures are quite large, for example, disability allowance and carer's allowance were 5% and 19%, respectively, over what was anticipated.  Carer's grant must be paid to 7,580 more people than anticipated and the domiciliary care allowance has to be paid to 12% more people than anticipated.  The Minister is seeking an increase of &euro;1.3 million for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  According to the figures provided, that will benefit 4,140 customers.  It shows that even small increases in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance have a wide impact.  It appears to be a very efficient way to target poverty.<\/p> <p>  The opposite is the case with the farm assist scheme.<\/p><p>It was paid to 800 fewer people than was anticipated.  Can the Minister comment on how the changes he is introducing will affect that and give us some idea of what he anticipates this will cost and how many will avail of it next year?  I also note there is a &euro;21.5 million underspend on community employment, CE, schemes.  The Minister will note a lot of agitation on the ground about the rules surrounding these schemes and the difficulty in qualifying for them, particularly for people on the JobPath scheme who want to transfer to the CE scheme.  In view of the underspend the Minister might consider relaxing some of those rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#B00300","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I know that much of the Supplementary Estimate deals with the Christmas bonus and the 85% allocation this year, which was announced with great fanfare.  Many people, however, are disappointed because when the Minister made the announcement the perception was that it was for everyone in receipt of social welfare but many people found out that they had to be in receipt of social welfare for 15 months or more.  One lady contacted me who has been receiving illness benefit since 2005, which is certainly a long-standing payment but she was told absolutely not when she inquired about the Christmas bonus.  While it was a good news story for the Minister, it would have been better if it had been a 100% restoration.  Many people who rely on that payment are very concerned.<\/p> <p>  The Minister extended the benefits for the self-employed, which was a positive and welcome first step.  When I questioned him he said he had not started to engage with the bodies who were expected to provide the services under the extended benefits, opticians and dentists, and that he would initiate that process.  Where is that process?  I was concerned that it was putting the cart before the horse.  We know from previous experience the difficulties that arose when the Minister adopted that strategy in a previous ministerial position.  <\/p> <p>  The underspend on JobBridge is not surprising.  We know the reasons for it.  There is no replacement scheme.  The Minister said one is being worked on.  We await that eagerly.  There is an underspend of &euro;12 million in the Gateway project.  Many local authorities have availed of the scheme.  I have criticised it because it is replacing what should be proper, full-time paid positions within local authorities. Does the underspend indicate that the scheme is being wound down?  If so, what is the rationale for that?  Is there a replacement scheme?  Are the participants going to be employed by local authorities?  <\/p> <p>  There is an underspend of &euro;25 million in the CE schemes.  We know how difficult it is for people to get on the scheme.  Many communities rely heavily on the scheme and that underspend sets off many alarm bells.  I am concerned, as are the community groups I work with, and I am sure many other Deputies have the same experience.  Can the Minister explain that? <\/p> <p>  None of the figures for JobPath is contained in the Estimates.  I have put a series of questions to the Minister.  We have seen privatisation of that area, a substantial body of work has been handed over to a private entity.  When I ask about it I am told the figures are commercially sensitive.  It is madness that a substantial sum of money is being allocated to Seetec and Turas Nua but we do not know how much.  Are the savings in the Estimates on administration and other areas due to the roll out of JobPath and the privatisation of that area?  This is making a serious impact.  I have spoken to many employees from local employment services across the State and the referrals coming to the local employment services, LES, from the Department are falling.  The fear is that because of the privatisation of that essential service, the LES is being wound down.  The Minister always bandies figures for official complaints about JobPath but many will not make an official complaint.  A person was in contact with me, a qualified journalist, who had been working part time, was then out of work and was referred to JobPath.  No disrespect to the young man who dealt with the client but he did not appear to have the necessary skills or qualifications for the job because the curriculum vitae he wrote up was pockmarked with all sorts of spelling and grammatical errors.  There are serious widespread problems.  It is madness to privatise that critical area when we as elected Members of the Oireachtas cannot see how much is spent.<\/p> <p>  Only this week I received the number of individuals penalised for not participating for whatever reason.  We have not seen the grounds or rationale for that.  In Wexford 42 individuals were penalised, 11 in Wicklow and a substantial number in Galway.  There are serious problems in JobPath and the Minister has said repeatedly that it is too early to initiate a review of it but the evidence speaks volumes.  There are serious problems, from its administration to its impact on the LES across the State and on those who are penalised.<\/p><p>It is having a huge impact on the individuals who are being penalised and we cannot get answers.  We do not know how much it is costing.  It is time for a comprehensive review of JobPath.<\/p><p> Through a series of parliamentary questions and through publicity, we are aware of the large number of carer's allowance appeals going to the social welfare appeals office.  What proportion of applicants are successful, given the Minister's reference to a 19% increase in claims?  There are significant problems with the administration of the allowance with the waiting time for appeals being up to 40 weeks.<\/p><p> Since the abolition of the State transition pension, more than 4,000 people aged 65 have been forced to sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  This is higher than for any other age cohort.  The figure raises concern and sets off many alarm bells.  I have made contributions in the House regarding this pension and specific cases where people hit the retirement age of 65 and were then forced to sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  The Minister may say serious pressure is not put on them to find a job when they hit that age but once they sign on for jobseeker's allowance, they have to ensure they are available for work and actively seek work.  It is a significant concern and I would like him to touch on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#C00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate.

I have not been involved in a fanfare; I have always been clear that the priority of this budget was to be prudent.  It was not a giveaway budget either in terms of welfare increases or tax cuts.  It was a prudent budget designed to reduce the deficit and make sure the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  Any changes will be modest.  On previous occasions, when the Christmas bonus was paid, there were press briefings, photo calls and so on.  I have not done any of that.  I do not wish to criticise my predecessor but she had a big photo call and all the rest of it.  I deliberately decided not to do any of that for obvious reasons.  I do not wish to make out that this is a giveaway; it is nothing of the sort.<\/p> <p>  The issue of people retiring aged 65 and not receiving the State pension until they are 66 is taxing my mind at the moment.  Deputy O'Dea mentioned it and he will be interested to know that while I was walking around the milk market in Limerick the other day, I met somebody who was required to retire at 65 but did not want to.  She still has lots to offer but she is on the jobseeker's allowance until she receives her pension.  She does not particularly want her pension at 66.  She is a young 65 and still wants to work.  Why should she not?  We need to do something about this.  It should have been joined up at the time but it was not.  That was a mistake made by the previous Government, of which I was a member.  When the State pension age was increased, we should have introduced the other measures at the same time but that was not done.  It is important though to remember that there is no compulsory retirement age in Ireland.  Nobody is required to retire at 65 and, therefore, they are not forced to sign on.  They can take a new job.  Many people in their 70s are working.  It is not that anyone is forced to sign on or is required by law to retire but many people, particularly public servants, are required to retire at 65 under the terms of their contracts.  An interdepartmental group looked into this.<\/p><p>It reported before the summer but it did not come up with enough.  It was one of these interdepartmental groups where the report indicated what we needed to consider, whereas I would usually think a group would come up with solutions.  I have a particular interest in this, as does the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who has responsibility for older people.  I have written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, about this, particularly with regard to public servants.  When it comes to our own staff, surely we should be in a position to say that if they do not want to retire at 65, they can wait until they are 66 or 67.  In areas like the health service it would be useful as it is quite hard to replace consultants and others who retire at 65 and before they want to.<\/p><p> I had a very interesting meeting with representatives of the Unite trade union during the week who told me about the law in Northern Ireland.  It might not be true but I am checking it; this is where I will say something good about Northern Ireland for a change.  Apparently the law in Northern Ireland means that if somebody is required to retire by a contract before the state retirement age, that person must be informed six months in advance and the onus is on the employer to prove why that person must retire at 65 rather than the state retirement age of 66 or 67.  That approach might provide a solution for us.  I need to check that and it might be something we could do in the spring Bill.  As far as I am concerned we need to increase the State pension age.  In the 1970s, when many of us here were born, the State pension age was 70 and people lived until they were 72 or 73.  The State pension age is now 66 and people live until their 80s.  One does not need a masters degree in maths to understand why we have a problem funding pensions.  We need to raise the State retirement age but we also need to facilitate people in working longer, particularly if they want to.  I hope we can sort that out in the first half of next year.<\/p><p> If we brought payment of the pension increase forward to 1 January, the additional cost would have been &euro;23 million and for all payments it would have been closer to &euro;70 million.  The rent supplement increase is &euro;9 million and we will come back with the figures for the discretionary payments element.  We know that since rent supplement limits were increased, the number of discretionary payments required fell off dramatically, although they are starting to tick up again.  The reason the increase is not as big as one might think is because of the transfer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  When we move from rent supplement to HAP, the budget moves from our Department to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There are also fewer people on rent supplement because more people are back working.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised disability and carers' payments, particularly the delays in processing carers' payments.  That has improved substantially, coming down from approximately 19 weeks to approximately 13 or 14 weeks now.  We need to keep bringing that down.  I have been to Longford, where staff are based, and met them.  Additional staff are being provided but it is quite a specialised area so those staff will need to be trained for a while.  The longer they are working there, the more quickly they will make decisions.  It is something we are working on.  There was a big increase in the spending for the carer support grant because we publicised the fact that one does not need to be in receipt of carer's allowance to get the carer support grant.  Many people did not know that and thought if they did not qualify for the carer's allowance, they could not get the carer support grant.  They can and we publicised that fact a bit this year, getting a flood of additional applications to Longford, which was good.<\/p><p> We are wondering about the increase in the number of people on disability and carer payments and we are trying to examine it in more detail.  Demographics is a major factor and there are more people and particularly older people in the country.  If there are more people and older people, there will be more people with disabilities and who need care.  It is partly about demographics but it is not all about them.  We are a bit concerned that there may be a drift in people from the jobseeker's allowance to carer's or disability allowance.  I would come across that in my constituency work.  There are people on jobseeker's allowance who probably should be on disability allowance because they are unable to work, which is fine, but there are people who certainly come into my office who are under pressure to take up employment.  I am surprised when they say to my face \"I am thinking of going on the sick, what do you reckon?\"  We believe there is a drift of people who are benefit shopping and moving from a payment with conditionality and activation attached to one that does not.  We have that concern but we do not yet have figures to back it up.  We must be very much aware of that.<\/p><p> The outturn in the farm assist programme this year was &euro;79 million and the estimated expenditure next year is &euro;82.8 million.  These are guesses, or intelligent estimates, as Deputies know the way in which farm incomes work.  They are very dependent on the price of milk or beef.  Given that we are fully reversing the cuts made in the past couple of years, the number of families benefitting might increase from approximately 8,000 to 10,000.  We should bear in mind that any family, even those currently in receipt of it, will get more.  This will be affected by the rural social scheme, RSS, as there are 500 more spaces on that.  Those who move from farm assist to RSS come off one budget and on to another despite being the same people.<\/p><p> There is an underspend on community employment, CE, this year.  Many people have speculated on this, as we have seen today, but the main reason is obvious.  There are half as many unemployed as there were four years ago.  Unemployment has gone down from 15% to 7.5% and in that time, the number of schemes has increased by over 50%.  There used to be a certain number of people applying for a certain number of schemes but now we have fewer people applying to more schemes.  The overriding reason there are fewer people on the schemes is that there are half as many people unemployed as there have been.  The number of schemes increased significantly during the recession but we have not pared them back all that much.  I know many CE supervisors around the country are blaming it on JobPath but that bothers me because it fundamentally misunderstands what JobPath does.  It is not another scheme, like CE, T&uacute;s, or Gateway.  JobPath is the process of somebody being worked with intensively for a year, essentially being recruited into employment.  If somebody goes on CE or T&uacute;s, he or she is still a cost to the Exchequer.  Somebody who gets a job through JobPath moves from being somebody dependent on a State payment to somebody who is not receiving a State payment and is working and paying tax.  One can think of the benefit for the individual and society.  If after a year that person does not get a job, once again he or she becomes eligible for CE and T&uacute;s.  I get really bothered when I get letters from CE supervisors and others suggesting that in some way, JobPath is competing with them or taking their people.  That is akin to saying a person has a job in a factory or a restaurant and cannot be kept on welfare.  It is a totally wrong approach and I get worried about CE supervisors who think that way and who see real and gainful employment paid for by someone else, with taxes being paid into the system, as something that is in competition with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#D00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Many of the jobs that people are getting with that are not sustainable or long-term.

We can have a conversation or debate without always having to interrupt people.  It is just basic manners.  Opinion is not fact.  If somebody works a 40-hour week on the minimum wage in Ireland, it is almost &euro;400 per week and the CE programme pays less than &euro;200.  Somebody on the minimum wage in Ireland working 30 hours per week is better off than somebody on CE so why would we want to lock somebody on a scheme rather than allow him or her get a minimum wage job?  That job is better paid than any scheme we have to offer.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned privatisation.<\/p><p>Seetec is a for-profit company.  Turas Nua is generally not-for-profit but many community employment, CE, sponsors and T&uacute;s sponsors are also private entities, and some of them are companies too.  It is not unprecedented, therefore, to have services outsourced to private providers.<\/p><p> Something I do intend to do, and I would hope people accept that this is the way forward because I acknowledge that some CE schemes and many CE supervisors are having trouble filling their positions, is to relax the rules in January to widen the pool of people eligible for CE.  Widening the pool will mean that the people schemes have to choose from will be a harder to reach group of people who need some more support and work.  Some CE schemes and CE supervisors will be happy with that because they are going back to their original effort, namely, social inclusion as well as employment activation, which is helping people who really need help and have difficulty holding down a job.  Others would prefer to be able to pick from a wider bunch of easier to work with people, but that is not where we should be, and now that we are back in a situation where we are approaching low unemployment, CE schemes should be more for people who cannot get minimum wage jobs or any job.  That is why I intend to relax those rules in the new year to widen the pool of people who can access CE and T&uacute;s but not to prevent them from getting gainful employment, even if it is a minimum wage job.<\/p><p> On the back to work family dividend, it is a new scheme.  It is difficult to estimate what the cost of it will be but we can give the Deputy more information on that if he wishes.<\/p><p> On the Christmas bonus, Christmas bonuses were only ever paid to long-term payment recipients.  It was always the case that they have to be on long-term payment to avail of the Christmas bonus.  It was never paid to people on illness benefit.  Somebody should not be on illness benefit since 2005.  I do not want to comment on an individual case but if the Deputy gives us the details, we will look into it.  It is supposed to be a short-term payment so somebody who is on it for that length of time should be on disability or invalidity pension, in which case they would receive the bonus.<\/p><p> On the opticians and the dentists, I had a very good meeting with the dentists last week and we are now in the position where we are trying to determine how it will work, but I am more confident than I might have been a week or two ago that we will be able to meet the March and October deadlines.  That meeting went well.  They have their requests, but that engagement will happen now at official level.  I will be speaking at one of their conferences in the new year and I would hope we will have that done within the timeframe for which we budgeted.<\/p><p> On Gateway, there is a significant underspend on Gateway.  That is down to less interest from local authorities.  The scheme is still in place.  Many local authorities are not as interested in it as they were in the past.  Sometimes that is because they are taking on people.  My local authority, Fingal, hired some people who were in Gateway, which was welcome.  In some cases, however, unions have withdrawn co-operation with Gateway, and for that reason local authorities are less interested.  The programme remains in place but we are considering winding it down.  Like JobBridge, it was a scheme for its time and there is less need for it now than would have been the case in the past.  We are considering the possibility of having a local authority arm and bringing it in under T&uacute;s rather than having a separate scheme, but a definite decision on that has not yet been made.<\/p><p> On the penalties, I reiterate that the only body that can impose penalty rates on anyone is the Department of Social Protection.  JobPath, Seetec, Turas Nua, local employment services and any of the rest of them cannot impose penalty rates.  That can only be done by the Department deciding officer.  Someone is less likely to have a penalty rate imposed on them if they are on JobPath than on Intreo, which is interesting.  People working with our case officers in Intreo are more likely to have a penalty rate imposed on them than those who are referred to JobPath, which is a point worth making.<\/p><p> So far in 2016, we reckon approximately 10,000 people will have had a penalty rate imposed on them at some point so we are talking about only 2% or 3% of people.  To be frank, in the real world there are 2% or 3% of people who do not engage and what do we do about that?  Should we tell them it is fine not to engage, that they do not have to turn up for interviews or training or do anything, that we do not care and that they should just keep taking the money?  There are 1% or 2% of people who will have penalty rates imposed on them for not participating and engaging, and we will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#E00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding this, and I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to relax the rules relating to community employment, but my experience of JobPath has been that if people have been unemployed and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for a certain period of time, that is sufficient to qualify for the JobPath scheme.  However, they have come to me and said they are not offered employment.  In some cases they are offered jobs that are so far away from where they live, they would be at a net loss if they took them.  Generally, however, many of them have not been offered employment and when a CE scheme comes up in an area for which they would be very suitable, they find that the cannot qualify for it because they are on JobPath.  Obviously, they would be better off on the CE scheme than on jobseeker's allowance and they would be doing something useful.  They would be working.

There is work to be done by local authorities but the proper way to do it is by increasing the number of staff within local authorities because much of the work that was being carried out by participants on Gateway was previously carried out by full-time paid employees of local authorities.  Rather than putting in place another scheme like T&uacute;s to replace Gateway, the Minister should start to employ more staff within local authorities.  The work needs to be done.

I do not want to repeat everything that was said earlier but there are major concerns about those, particularly in terms of people on JobPath not being able to take up CE schemes.  The Minister spoke about relaxing the rules to increase the pool of people.  I would like a briefing note from the Minister in the coming week laying out exactly what he means and the rules that will be relaxed.  That is critical, particularly for people who are locked into JobPath.  I do not want to put individual cases to the Minister here but one man who came to me did not know how to turn on a computer yet he has to go into the JobPath office every week and is put sitting in front of a computer that he does not even know how to turn on.<\/p><p>I do not see what benefits are in place for such an individual.  Many people must travel long distances at a huge cost on a weekly basis to carry out pointless tasks that do not improve their chances of employment.  There are no travel allowances for such individuals.  There are huge problems with JobPath and community employment schemes.  I would like the Minister to brief us on the matter.<\/p><p> I wish to make a final point about the huge problems with pensions and the State transition pension.  The Minister may be aware that I have tabled a Private Members' motion for next week on the gender inequality relating to pensions and the difficulties that 65 year olds face.  We need a broader discussion on pensions and I hope my Private Members' motion will act as the starting point in that regard.  I look forward to debating this complex issue.  I view the matter in simple terms: forcing 65 year olds on to the jobseeker's scheme is unsustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#F00300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments and his intention to relax the rules relating to CE and broaden the pool of people who are eligible to participate.

If somebody wants to complain, he or she will pursue the matter.  Deputy O'Dea has said that people have complaints but that they are afraid to bring them further.  If I complain, it is because I want to bring a matter further.  JobPath provides confidence-building and motivation coaching and identifies a person's talents.  This is good because an individual may not have explored the right job opportunities.  JobPath is in every county and provides a service to people whose confidence has been shaken in the past couple of years.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned gender equality in respect of pensions.

They would be pretty foolish to put people into jobs in which they will not last three months because that would mean that they - the companies - would not be paid.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Estimate, subhead A2 refers to agency services and there is a &euro;14 million underspend.  As much as &euro;12 million of the &euro;14 million accounts for money that we did not pay for JobPath because we must verify the results before we get them.  A customer survey is now under way but I have no updates other than what I said last week.  I ask members to bear in mind that if the customer survey results are unfavourable, then the JobPath scheme will be docked.  If the companies providing JobPath do not resolve the issues, they could potentially lose their contracts.

I particularly encourage Sinn F&eacute;in to do this in Dublin city.<\/p> <p>  On Gateway and supplies to any scheme, the initiative often gives somebody something to do every day and a bit of work experience.  One will have individuals who might apply for an outdoor job as a general operative with a local authority but he or she will not succeed because he or she has no experience.  The Gateway scheme will give a person the experience necessary to subsequently get the job.  There is always a role for these programmes.<\/p> <p>  I have not decided exactly which rules to relax and I am totally open to receiving submissions and suggestions from individuals or committee members.  I ask everyone to bear in mind a valid point made by Deputy Brady to the effect that people can get locked into JobPath for 12 months.  I advise that people can get locked into a CE scheme for three, six or ten years.  I want to relax the rules in a way that will give people who do not currently have the opportunity to participate in CE or on other schemes the opportunity to do so.  I do not want to relax the rules in such a way that allows people to get locked in, not just for 12 months but for six and ten years.  In the past people got stuck on these schemes and ended up on a never ending cycle of welfare schemes.  There is an exception.  Part of any reform should recognise the fact that there is a group of people in society who would struggle to hold down a job for lots of different reasons.  We should be honest about that and treat them differently.  I do not want people locked into schemes.  One meets people all the time who genuinely believe that they can never move on from schemes and that they are the only option for them.  That is not true.  It is important that we do not allow people to be institutionalised on a programme or a scheme because that would not be in their best interests.  They sometimes suit the organisation because they become very experienced and good at what they do but it is not the right thing for them.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question about the carers' claims, we do not have that information to hand but we will give the Deputy that figure when we have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#G01500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I am about to conclude.
