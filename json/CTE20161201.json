Syria has become a shadow of itself in the past five years, with the killing and maiming of so many innocent people, the mass migration of its citizens to a very uncertain future and the wanton destruction of vital infrastructure, buildings and many artefacts of great historical importance.  Against this background, the joint committee agreed to requests from various interest groups with first-hand experience of these shocking atrocities to make presentations to us.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear opening statements and comments which will be followed by a question and answer session with the members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#C00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480582800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for having us.  We appreciate this opportunity to tell our story and will try to be brief.  We are here to tell the story of what is happening in our country.  We truly appreciate the Irish experience of forging peace.  We are mindful of the Irish efforts to bring peace to this island.  I lived in Ireland for two years between 1989 and 1991.  I was here when the peace treaty in the North was brokered and we thank God for the peace that prevails here.  We are here to raise awareness of what is happening in Syria and tell the committee about the suffering of the Syrian people.  <\/p> <p>  I am encouraged by what I see on the screen, the quotation of the former director of Louvre Museum, \"Every person has two homelands, his own and Syria.\"<\/p><p>Syria was a homeland for humanity and we say that civilisation started in northern Mesopotamia and Syria.  The first alphabet was invented in Syria.  We have lived together as Christians and Muslims for 15 centuries, not without certain difficulties but we came to know how to respect each other and how to accept each other.  What is happening today has nothing to do with religion or religious wars although it is being waged in the name of religion.  Those who are killing us are mainly Muslim fanatics who do not believe in co-existence or in accepting the other.  We have heard from many people that there is nothing called a moderate opposition.  Even President Obama has said this to us when we sat with him two years ago.  He said that moderate opposition was a fantasy and that it does not exist.  We are facing terrorism.<\/p><p> Of course, there was and always will be legitimate demand for reforms in Syria, which is part of the political process of every country and State.  We support continuous review and reform of our political system where everyone should have the rights and obligations as a Syrian citizen.  All of us should be treated equally in the eyes of the law.  That is our hope for the new Syria to come.  Changing regimes and bringing reforms, however, at such a high cost with the blood of so many Syrians should not be the case.  We are here to ask Ireland to help us to bring peace back to Syria.  Those who fight with us kill our people, and kidnap our bishops.  Two archbishops of Aleppo have been kidnapped since April 2013 and we do not know anything about them.  A prominent Muslim cleric, Dr. Mohammed al-Bouti was killed inside a mosque and many others have been hanged at the doors of the mosques.  Churches and schools have been destroyed.  These people are not the freedom fighters they claim to be.  They want to force on Syrians, both Christian and Muslim, their way of life which is dangerous for all of us but also dangerous for Europe and the West.<\/p><p> These terrorists have sleeping dormant cells in Europe and they can be activated at any time.  His Excellency, the Grand Mufti of Syria lost his son who was killed at the doors of Aleppo University because the terrorists wanted his father to change sides but he refused.  They killed his son.  The next day a delegation was visiting him from Lebanon and he told the delegation that he forgave my son's killers and that his son's murder should yield peace for Syria.  He asked the killers to come forward, to sit and talk and to enter into a dialogue.  They, however, sent him a text message the following day that said they were not interested in his forgiveness.  This is the situation we are living in.  The people are suffering on all sides.  Civilians are being killed but millions are also going hungry today.  The churches and the religious institutions are doing a great job in coming to the aid and fulfilling the needs of these people.<\/p><p> We are overwhelmed by these needs.  Our plea to the great Irish people is to stand with us, to pray for us and to advocate on our behalf to have real serious Syrian dialogue, to encourage the national reconciliation movement currently happening in parts of Syria.  As a result of this reconciliation movement many armed people are giving up their arms and coming back to society.  This is what we would like to see.  We do not want violence and we do not want anybody to be killed.  We want real reconciliation and for peace to prevail in Syria.  We feel that sometimes we are abandoned by the international community because all the talk is about the rebels and what the rebels are suffering, but nobody is talking about how much the real Syrian people living under Government control areas are suffering.  One week or ten days ago a school in western Aleppo was targeted by the rebels and seven children and three adults were killed.  On the same day the University of Aleppo was targeted by missiles.<\/p><p> There are also many atrocities being committed by pockets of rebels surrounding our cities in areas where the Government is in control.  I live in old Damascus, the historic part, not far from the straight street where Saint Paul was led to be baptised.  Occasionally bombs are dropped on us by rebels who live not too far from there, about 2 km, and who entered the Jobar district and other places.  There is no safe place in Syria for anybody.  All Syrians need peace and Syria should be a mother who brings back all her children again, especially those who are in third countries and those who are risking their lives to make it to Europe.  We want them all to come back but to come back and live in peace the way Syrians have lived for many centuries.  Nobody should accept killers among us who kill us in the name of freedom and human rights.  It is unfortunate that the Western media is taking most of its stories from a one-man show in London called the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Nobody knows who is paying this man and who is supplying him with stories.  There are so many stories our friends in the West do not hear.  We are here to tell some of these stories.  I appreciate the opportunity and I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ignatius Aphrem II","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aphrem.

We are honoured and are privileged to be with the committee today.  I am a cardiothoracic surgeon.  After I lived and trained in the UK for 17 years I qualified from the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin.  I did my last exam in Cork in 2013.  I was honoured to get this qualification.  Having lived in England for 17 years, two years ago I moved to Damascus to work in one of the main hospitals in Damascus as a cardiothoracic surgeon.<\/p> <p>  I have come to the committee today to speak about the situation we are suffering on a daily basis, with a focus on the medical aspect.  Syria has been transformed during this crisis from a country that exported medicine to more than 80 countries to being a country that is getting bits and pieces of medicine from here and there.  EU sanctions have affected our medical system very badly.  We have a shortage of supply on a daily basis.  Children are dying because there is no medicine.<\/p><p>Children are affected by the weather because there is no fuel to heat.  The situation is very bad and the European sanctions have had very bad effects.<\/p><p> We came here to pass on a message that Syria needs help from Ireland and similar countries.  Irish people should come to Damascus to see the situation for themselves, rather than believing the propaganda.  I take this opportunity to thank two people from the Irish Parliament, namely, Deputy Clare Daly and Senator David Norris, for their help in trying to reunite Syrian Palestinian, Mrs. Hajar Saleh, one of my nurses in Damascus, with her grandson, Gafar Azouz, who was the only survivor when his entire family was gunned down on the Turkish border.  I thank the joint committee again for its help and for extending this invitation to me.

Today, I feel we are part of the committee.  Our concerns are your concerns and having us here today means we belong to one family.  Dear friends, I have not come here to tell you about Syria.  We are here as ambassadors for peace who are asking for peace in Syria.  A short time ago, in mid-September, we gathered 1.04 million signatures of children in 6,000 schools throughout Syria and we brought these to the European Union to tell them that the children are ambassadors for Syria.<br\/><br\/>King Solomon said there is a time for peace and a time for war.  We have had enough war.  We can have war forever but now is the time for peace.  Enough speaking about the cross of Syria.  The committee knows about that.  We are not seeking to find out who is guilty because in war, everybody is guilty in one way or another.  War is war.  It is not human and not the call of God.  The Holy Bible speaks of the mystery of evil - <i>mysterium iniquitatis<\/i>.  We are now living this mystery of evil in this world.  This is what we have to fight, not just in Syria, Iraq or wherever.<br\/><br\/>We are here to work for peace and to ask the committee to create a lobby for peace.  The Holy Father Franciscus will visit Ireland next year and we are happy for Ireland.  He has made two pleas for peace in the Middle East.  One of his pleas is for a consensual alliance among all powers of the world to fight something which is not part of the world or Islamic.  Not one Muslim state will accept to be under the title, Islamic State.  While it was in power in Raqqa, it is nothing today.  The spirit of Islam is felt today.  It is not the time to speak about Islamic or this or that.  We must now change minds and the key to doing this is to have an alliance.  We can overcome ISIS in a very short time if the two superpowers, Russia and the United States, come together.  What is ISIS?  It is nothing.  The Holy Father says one can speak about peace and deliver money, valuable weapons and warriors to Syria.  It is shameful that the superpowers are not able to deliver peace in Syria.  Every little boy says, &quot;Look, they are fighting each other, not ISIS&quot;.  It is clear that there is a very shameful policy today.  We can make peace by coming together.<br\/><br\/>The second plea made by the Holy Father was for justice for Palestine.  If we, as Jews, Christians and Muslims, sort out the conflict in the Holy Land, we can do a great deal for peace in the Middle East and the world.  Therefore, we are appealing to Ireland, the land of peace, to start an initiative among states that pursue independent policies and are outside the system of alliances.  This lobby for peace could include non-governmental organisations and states to make a worldwide lobby for peace.  As Patriarch, I ask that the bishops conferences of Europe gather together to raise their voices for peace.  Why not have a common paper of all patients because we know Islam better than others.  We are like an ambassador for Islam to European Christians who are telling Europe and Christians worldwide to come together and produce a paper to show that we are peacemakers.<br\/><br\/>Our appeal is to act on the basis of justice, love, forgiveness and dialogue, which are preferable to the concept of war.  We are living with the ideology of &quot;war, war, war&quot;.  Let us have something else.  As the Assyrian Patriarch, I am making this call with my colleague, his beatitude, and the Grand Mufti who is also our Mufti.  It is absolute imperative that we change our outlook and ways of dealing with disputes.  This cannot be done by means of arms and weapons.  We must change the world today.  Our message is that we must change the outlook of the world.  The real power of our faith - Christians, Muslims and Jews alike - is that faith is part of the solution to problems.  We are seeking something else and faith can help us to make peace in the world. <br\/><br\/>Dear brothers and sisters, Christians and Muslims have a shared history going back 1,435 years.  My slogan is that we should stay together to build a new world, we can stay together to build a new world and we want to stay together to build a new world.  That is our mission.  I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to appear before it and hear the view of some Christians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Gregory III Laham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480582800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be in this Parliament to talk about the suffering of my country.  The gentlemen who have spoken are angels of peace coming from the heart of Syria.  They represent the Syrian people and Syrian suffering and they are Syrian made, representing all colours and diversity of Syria.  I am sure members know about the history of Syrian and the country's diversity, beauty and dignity.<\/p><p>The question arises as to why we came here.  We love Ireland.  We feel Ireland is the land of peace.  It never occupied or colonised any country.  Its missions and Army are always helping to maintain peace all over the world.  We love this.  We have close relations and we have a similar society and way of living.<\/p><p> Regarding the difficulties and atrocities in my country, it is a long story and there is too much to say, but I will try to condense it as much as possible.  A few days after the events started, the hospital in Homs, the third largest city in the country, was attacked by militia carrying guns and shouting slogans against the Government.  Everything was burned and stolen.  After a few days, when circumstances improved, we discovered a nurse who was left hanged in the hospital.  We realised at that time that we were facing difficult days.  Hospitals in Syria were always safe, places where people could be given reassurance, satisfaction, help and support.  Unfortunately, in my country, hospitals became soft targets.  They became places for fighting and for attacks against all aspects of safety, security and reassurance.  We can say for sure - I do not want to go through the presentation now - that 50% of our hospitals and medical centres have been destroyed, damaged, looted and attacked.  Our staff have been kidnapped, tortured and slaughtered.  Our ambulances have been stolen, damaged and burned, and sometimes used to kill people with explosions.<\/p><p> After the difficult relations with Europe began, we depended on ourselves for the manufacture of medication.  Using the help and advice of friends and other countries, ours became a country that was able to export medication to different countries.  My colleague mentioned a figure of approximately 80 countries.  I definitely recall 54 countries to which we used to send medicinal products.  Our medication met 80% to 95% of our needs.  However, our factories were destroyed, damaged and looted and we became reliant on medication from the black market, purchased despite the weak purchasing power of our currency because of the siege.  We became unable to buy medication for the poor people.  In the time before 2011, our medications were well known to be of good quality and cheap.<\/p><p> The national health service in Syria was free for people.  We used to pay only a little for very specialised surgeries, such as heart surgery.  There were ambitious plans by the Syrian Government in 2011 to build 25 more hospitals.  I refer to specialist hospitals, including university medical colleges.  The objective was to create prosperity and peace for all the country.  I do not know what happened but I would like to make one point clearly.  Of course, we love peace.  We are looking for peace.  This is from the heart of the Syrian people.  The sanctions applied to our country destroyed, damaged, killed and depleted our capacity to manufacture medication and treat our patients.  It affected us in a very devastating way.  The sanctions killed more than ISIS did.<\/p><p> I am proud to be a member of the royal college of this green country that we love.  We would love the sanctions to be lifted now.  We would love a good initiative to be launched from this highly dignified Parliament, and by the Irish people who are very close to our hearts.  We would love the help, support, advice and experience of Ireland so we could rebuild the hospitals and meet our medical needs.  We seek advice and for specialist hospitals to be built in the name of Ireland.  We need our doctors to come to Ireland.  Doctors from our medical college in Damascus specialise to a high level all over the world, including in every hospital in Ireland, England, Germany, eastern Europe and Latin America.  We are proud of our universities and of our capacity to rebuild.  We need the sanctions to be lifted and to be given an opportunity.  We need support and advice.  Ireland is a friend of Syria and we love it.  We are looking forward to rebuilding good relations with this country as soon as possible.  The airlines should be allowed easy access so help can be provided easily.  The relationship with this country should be allowed to develop.  I hope Ireland will be first in a process of opening relations with other countries, in medicine and other parts of life.<\/p><p> I assure the members that we are able, with the help of our angels of peace, to rebuild Syria much better, create peace and defeat terrorism.  Stability will be the cornerstone of stability throughout the world, specifically in Europe.  I cannot tell whether there will be trouble everywhere if Syria does not succeed.  One can see with one's eyes what is happening now.  We are, in our way, willing to create peace in this country with the help the Syrian people, Syrian leaders and representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bashir Mohammad","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480582800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>In the name of God, I wish I could talk to the members in English but my language is that of the Bible, gospel, Old Testament and the Koran.<\/p><p>Perhaps the only target in this meeting is the Grand Mufti of Syria.  I was following up what happened in the media during the past 48 hours and what is surprising is that many who speak in the media know me personally but do not want the truth to be shown or my voice, the voice of peace and security, to be known.  I thank the committee especially as it has gone beyond these lies, did not believe them and wanted to hear from us.  I thank the Irish citizen, Dr. Declan Hayes, who visited us in Syria.  He visited my house and wrote a book about that.  He swore that he would let my voice be heard.  I thank Declan for that.  I thank the Irish people, who have not colonised any country at all or attacked anybody.  Therefore, I would like the committee to hear my story first.<\/p><p> In 2008 I was invited to the European Parliament to speak about the Islamic world.  Some members may have listened to that speech.  Before I reached the European Parliament and after me the Pope was coming, as well as the Dalai Lama.  Two Arab countries asked the President of the European Parliament how a secular mufti was allowed to speak about Islam, arguing that only Saudi Arabia and Egypt can speak about Islam.  Syria is a secular country and the mufti is a secular mufti.  I reached the European Parliament after the vote and Syria had received high votes.<\/p><p> I spoke in calling for peace.  I greeted the Parliament by saying As-Salumu Alaikum and good morning in all languages.  The media criticised me because I said good morning and Shalom.  For three years they criticised me.  They said the Grand Mufti of Syria is greeting the Israelites.  That is what they said.  They quoted one part of my speech.  They reported that if we destroy all the churches and the mosques in the world, it is much easier than killing one small child because man is the construction of God.  We have built the mosques and churches.  Back then they attacked me because I said such things.  When the events started in 2011 in Syria, an Arab emir called me.  He invited me to leave Syria and he told me he had a castle for me and my family.  I told him I had to stay in Syria to be the bridge of peace between the opposition and the regime.  I represent neither the opposition nor the regime but rather the Syrian people.  When the regime is against the people, I will be with the people against the regime.<\/p><p> The response to my answer in this phone call was the assassination of my son five days later when he was at the door of the university.  He had never held a gun or weapon.  Before burying my child, I stood before everyone and said I had forgiven everyone on condition they lay down their weapons.  The answer was they did not need forgiveness.  This has caused me much pain but what is more painful is that a year after burying my child, the revolutionaries came to the place where he was buried.  They took him out of the grave and I do not know where they put him.  This is the revolution in Syria.<\/p><p> If this was a revolution to reform the regime, I would have been with it but it is a revolution to kill men.  I made statements and that is what is being talked about in the media.  The Islamic centre in Dublin is talking about this.  Its representatives have said I will send terrorists to Europe to kill themselves.  I do not know why they lie in their translations.  I said not to bombard Syria or Lebanon and that if fire is burning in Syria and Lebanon, there are dormant cells in the world that will awake.  I feared for Europe that terrorism would reach it.  The same words were uttered by King Salman one or two years ago.  They clapped for him.<\/p><p>A week ago, the President of Turkey said that this terrorism would reach Europe if Turkey was not allowed to join the European Union.  Why do they lie about me?  I have never spoken about an Islamic state, a Christian state or a Jewish state.  The state is secular and civil.  Christ did not build a state.  Mohammed did not build a state.  We build states and we call them what we want.  Therefore, I came from Syria to Ireland to tell you \"Please do not listen to the media\".  Come to Syria to see what they have done to us.<\/p><p> I have met some of those from London, Australia, Belgium, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey who were arrested.  I met them in prison and asked them why they came to Syria.  They said the Islamic centres in Europe called them to come and install an Islamic state in Syria.  They said they gathered money and trained them to fight in Turkey.  I asked them what was their number.  They said they were a group of 100 fighters.  I asked them where their friends were.  They said most of them had been killed.  I asked them who killed them.  They said that some were killed fighting the Syrian army.  Some of them discovered the lie and wanted to return to their countries, so they were killed by the terrorist groups.  Therefore, Syria needs you today so that fire does not spread to the whole world.  Politically, let them open the doors and listen to the other side.  I am ready tomorrow to go to the Islamic centre in Dublin and say to them: \"Ask me what you want.  I am ready to answer.\"  However, I refuse to hear one side and just stick to one side.<\/p><p> A year ago, I was awarded the Ducci Foundation Peace Prize in Italy.  I asked permission to go there to receive the prize but I was refused a visa.  I, therefore, asked Bishop Kabugi to receive this prize for me.  The newspapers reported that for the first time in history a Mufti from the Arab countries asked a bishop to receive the prize.  They do not know Syria.  In Syria, there are 23 million Christians, 23 million Arabs, 23 million Kurds and 23 million Muslims.  We are one people.  Only God will ask me whether I am Muslim, Christian, Sunni, Kurdish or Arab.  What is preventing the Prime Minister of Syria from being Christian or atheist if he is just?  This is Syria, which has paid a high price for 300,000 fighters who came from Europe and the Arab countries.<\/p><p> I thank the committee once more.  I thank the Irish people.  I ask you to send us food and medicine, to open your doors and help us find peace.  I greet you in the name of the Syrian people in all their denominations.  Thank you and God bless you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank you for your contribution.

I had the opportunity to meet His Holiness in Foscari with the Holy Father, Pope Francis.  I have already heard his case concerning what is happening to our Christian brethren not just in Syria but also in the Middle East generally.  Two years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the refugee camps in Lebanon with Cardinal Sch&ouml;nborn.  We met Christian families that were forcibly removed from Syria by ISIS.  We heard their harrowing stories and learned how they felt abandoned and forgotten.  They do not want to move to other countries to live in refugee camps; they want to return home to their native country.<\/p> <p>  There is an onus on the international community, including all governments, to work together to find a solution to the problems in the Middle East.  The latter should not be a pawn between the two major superpowers.  I do not agree with the comments of Donald Trump about Muslims and Mexicans during the US presidential election campaign.  Those comments only inciting more hatred.  I hope President-elect Trump will retract his words and work to find a peaceful solution not just in Syria but also in the Middle East generally.<\/p> <p>  Ireland will be a friend and will work with the witnesses, but ours is a small nation.  We have to punch above our weight both at the United Nations and within the European Union.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to arrange a debate in Parliament, hopefully before Christmas, to get the support of the Government and the Oireachtas for a worldwide movement to bring peace to the Middle East.  Dr. Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun is correct that sanctions do not work because they adversely affect ordinary people.  I have read that 49% of Syria's hospitals have been destroyed, while 23% of hospitals are inaccessible, as are medical supplies that are desperately needed.  I plead for these sanctions to be lifted in order to provide much-needed supplies in Syria.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun could elaborate on the national reconciliation movement and how we can work with it.  As the Chairman said, in order to achieve peace, one has to lay down arms and talk.  If that does not happen, then peace cannot be achieved.<\/p><p>Perhaps we could work with the national reconciliation movement as a small nation to give example of what we have achieved in Northern Ireland.  That took decades but I hope it will not be the case in the Middle East.<\/p><p> There are other speakers and I could go on all day.  Perhaps one or two of the witnesses will outline their view on the Russian involvement in Aleppo.  We heard from the archbishop of Aleppo when he was smuggled out in a steel container under a truck to speak to us in Frascati.  He also spoke on the occasion we met Pope Francis.  We know the harrowing situation and what is happening in Aleppo.  Perhaps the witnesses will give us their views on the Russian involvement.  I am delighted to meet the witnesses again and perhaps we will have a chat after the session.  As I said, Ireland will be a friend and will work with the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#H00300","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and thank the delegation for coming.  I thank the Grand Mufti for telling his story and the tragic story of the loss of his son.  I sympathise with him on the tragic murder of his son.  He described himself as a bridge between the opposition and the government.  In the past here, members of all faiths have acted as bridges in Northern Ireland, including Fr. Faul, Fr. Reid, and others from other denominations have acted as bridges when there was nobody else to act.  It is very important that people of many faiths come together when politicians fail to talk to each other.  It is important that people talk to each other.<\/p> <p>  The issue of sanctions is one we have been asked to address.  As my colleague has pointed out, sanctions only hurt children and the elderly.  The regime and those fighting the regime can get around sanctions but, unfortunately, civilians cannot.  I agree with my colleagues that it is ineffective.  It is worse than ineffective; it is killing innocent people.  We saw that tragically in Iraq when the UN sanctions damaged the supply of simple medicines.  That is the sad reality of it and yet now it is being repeated.  Hospitals are without basic medicines and people are dying from the lack of proper medical supplies.<\/p> <p>  What is the delegation's views on what is happening in Aleppo?  It is the one issue featuring on all our media at this time.  There are many different areas of conflict within Syria.  There is huge slaughter of innocent people of all faiths and religions.  It is a tragedy of monumental proportions which, unfortunately, has its origins 100 years ago in the middle of the First World War when the fate of the Middle East was decided by powers in Europe that had washed their hands of their actions.  The consequences are now being played out throughout the Middle East and they continue to fail the people of the Middle East by their actions and inaction.  What are the witnesses' views on Aleppo, Russian and American involvement, what Europe is doing, what Europe is failing to do and what should happen?  I agree with my colleagues about trying to get the medicine in and the issue of sanctions.  I apologise as I have to go to another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#J00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I am concerned that we did not hear from any of the witnesses any condemnation of the brutal regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  Our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has briefed us on the fact that Assad has sought to undermine every effort at reaching a negotiated resolution to the conflict since 2011.  While we may acknowledge the effect of sanctions on civilian populations, there is a reason sanctions have been imposed against the Syrian Government, and that is the recognition of the brutality of the Assad regime.  We will hear later from Robin Yassin-Kassab about his experience and writing on Syria.<\/p> <p>  I would like to put to the witnesses some of the issues in which the Assad regime, together with its Russian Government allies, has been engaged.  We put these issues to the Russian ambassador when he was before the committee recently.  More than 900,000 Syrian civilians are under siege and hundreds of thousands are in eastern Aleppo which is being bombarded by Syrian Government forces, that is, by Assad's forces backed by Russian allies.  We know from M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, the humanitarian charity, that it has 45 tonnes of medical supplies this week waiting to enter eastern Aleppo but it cannot reach the desperate civilian population there.  I have spoken to people who have family in eastern Aleppo and we have eye witness accounts from M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res of the suffering of the population there.  We see and hear about the suffering, the civilian deaths and the deaths of children.  We have seen attacks on hospitals.  Physicians for Human Rights says that between March 2011 and May 2016, there were 373 attacks on health facilities in Syria.  The doctors have spoken of this but the vast majority of these attacks were carried out by Syrian Government, the Assad regime and its allies.  On 19 September 2016, there was an aerial attack on a United Nations aid convoy which is the subject of an international investigation.  It was a humanitarian convoy targeted by the regime and its allies.  On 10 August there were accounts of chlorine gas attacks by the regime.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that we have not heard from the witnesses an attack or any sort of critique of the Assad regime.  I am very concerned that the first speaker made the comment that there is no moderate opposition in Syria.  Even the Russian ambassador acknowledged to us that the Russian Government is seeking to conduct local peace agreements and has conducted several with moderate opposition groups through Syria.  All of us utterly condemn ISIS or Daesh and its appalling and brutal attacks on civilian populations.  I absolutely agree with colleagues on that.  We are very conscious of the Yazidi population.  We are absolutely clear on that.  We condemn ISIS outright because it has brutalised the civilian population.  We also need to be clear about the attacks by the Syrian Government on civilians and about the fact the Syrian Government has resisted peace negotiations too.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Grand Mufti.  We have heard condemnation from the Irish Syria Solidarity Movement of the Grand Mufti's speech in 2011.  I watched the video of his speech on Syrian television on 9 October 2011 in which he says, \"I say to all of Europe and to the US: We will prepare martyrdom seekers who are already among you.\"  That was relating to the bombing of Syria and Lebanon.  The Grand Mufti has spoken about that.  He has had invitations withdrawn by other foundations following that speech.  I am very concerned that it is the sort of speech that can inflame situations.  It did not sound to me like a peaceful speech.<\/p> <p>  All of us here want to see peace in Syria.  We would all support any genuine efforts to bring about peace in Syria.  We have put that to the Russian ambassador and we will put it to anyone who comes before us.  We want to see an end to the suffering of the civilian population in Syria, given that 13.5 million Syrian people are now in need of humanitarian assistance.  It is devastating to see what was a developed, secular and diverse country falling into this horrible chaos.  We also need to acknowledge the responsibility and where that lies.  It lies very clearly with the Syrian regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#J00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am substituting for my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe today.  I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na toscair&iacute; at&aacute; anseo.  I wish the delegation well on its journey.  It has been a long journey by the look of it considering where Syria is today and where it was many years ago when it was an example to many in the world.  I am from a party that was censored for many years and which had propaganda spewed against it.  It continues to this day to a degree so I understand the need to have the truth and to see the truth for myself.  I apologise that I have not been to Syria in recent years but the next best thing is to hear from these and other witnesses exactly what is happening on the ground.  There will be versions of the truth and the job of the committee is to plough our way as much as we can to figure out where we can help and what we can do to help to create a greater understanding of the horrors of war in Syria.<\/p><p>The conflict has been simplistically described as involving Daesh and the rebels on one side, the Russians and the Syrian Government on another and the US and the rebels on yet another side.  The truth is a lot more complex, as is the case with any war.  <\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned the desire for peace and that is the one of the main points I will take away from today's meeting.  Sometimes it is very difficult to see, in the depths of a war, that peace is a lot closer than it seems.  The delegation here today is reaching out and calling for peace, as are many within Syria itself.  I wish the witnesses well in that.<\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to outline what they can see ahead, beyond the destruction.  The horror of the war sometimes clouds our vision.  What is the vision, given what has happened?  We cannot go back to the situation that pertained five or six years ago, so what is the new vision?  What can be salvaged?<\/p><p> Have the witnesses' churches and faith followers been targeted in the same way as the Yazidis?  We have all heard about the Yazidis, about the destruction of their homes and the fact that they have been specifically targeted during this war.  Have there been similar sectarian attacks against the followers of the witnesses' churches?<\/p><p> Since the relief of parts of Aleppo, have the witnesses been in touch with people who have come out of that siege?  How has that siege affected the people?  Can they see any hope of peace?  Mention was made of the tentative peace moves of late.  Is it just the Russians who are involved in such moves or are there other negotiations taking place?  <\/p><p> Mention was also made of the attacks on medical facilities.  Do the witnesses condemn such attacks, regardless of who the perpetrators are or who is running such medical facilities, that is, whether they are controlled by the regime or the rebels?  <\/p><p> Finally, I wish the witnesses well.  In my lifetime I have never seen this type of horror rained down on a population.  International wars and disputes are being fought out on the witnesses' lands, which should never have happened.  International might is trying to decide the future of Syria rather than the Syrian people themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#J00400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.

First, I do not agree that Ireland is a small country that cannot do much.  It can do a lot.  There is a saying related to Gaelic football, that it is important to get the points and not to worry about the goals, that the goals can come later.  We can start, little by little, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the points made about the cessation of war and the need for dialogue and respect for difference.  That is also our mission and our demand.  We want a new Syria, a Syria for all Syrians that respects diversity and gives a chance to all Syrians to serve their country.  However, we do not think that having an opposition that is armed will help Syria.  No country in the world would accept an opposition, moderate or otherwise, that is armed and killing people.  I said there should be no more use of the word \"opposition\" because, as President Obama said, it is a fantasy.  That said, President Obama and the US Government trained thousands of people and spent $500 million on the so-called \"moderate\" opposition but they all joined Daesh and al-Nusra, except for five or six individuals.  I say this on the basis of US reports and information.  It is not my information but comes from the US administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ignatius Aphrem II"},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>What about the Russian ambassador's point that his Government is trying to negotiate with moderate groups and has negotiated peace agreements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#K00400","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480582800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Russians have also said that they have been asking the Americans for months to identify the moderate opposition but the Americans are unable to do so because there is none.  That said, there are people who want reform and we welcome any opposition that is unarmed and political in nature.  One of the opposition leaders in Syria right now heads a reconciliation movement.  There are moderate people who are willing to sit down and negotiate.  They are willing to give up their arms and return to society.  There are thousands of such people.  We have not been able to go through the suburb of alTel, north of Damascus, to get to our monastery because the rebels were in charge.  Last week, however, the rebels came to an agreement with the Government, gave up their arms and created a local security apparatus to take care of the place and to make sure nobody would be hurt.  This is what we are calling for - negotiation and dialogue among Syrians to find ways to live together.  We do not want anyone else to be killed, even members of Daesh and other groups.  We do not want them to be killed as long as they leave us alone and leave us in peace.<\/p> <p>  The atrocities of ISIS have been recognised as acts of genocide by the US Congress, the British Parliament, the European Union Parliament and the Australian Parliament.  Perhaps it would be possible for the Irish Parliament to recognise the atrocities of ISIS and other fanatical groups against Christians, Yazidis and others as acts of genocide.  Hopefully after that action will be taken on foot of such recognition that will bring those who are committing these atrocities to justice.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about attacks on Christians and people of other faiths.  We have been targeted as Syrians who are not willing to take sides.  As Christians, we do not take sides.  The Government wanted us to arm young people to guard our churches but we refused to do that at the beginning.  However, our people found that they were going to be killed and crushed by the so-called opposition unless they defended themselves.  Hence, some young Christians came together, took up arms and defended their neighbourhoods.  I personally was the target of a suicide attack last June.  I was in my home town and 35 m from where I was standing, at a gathering of people commemorating the 100th anniversary of genocide against our people during the time of the Ottoman Empire, a suicide bomber set himself off and two people were killed.  I was only 35 m away from him.  Two of our archbishops were kidnapped and we know nothing of their whereabouts.  Many priests have been killed and many churches have been destroyed.  Mosques have also been destroyed and Islamic religious scholars have also been killed.  All the people are being targeted.  Daesh and other groups act in the name of Islam but they do not represent the Islam that we lived with.  We do not believe they represent the real Islam that existed in Syria for 1,500 years.  <\/p> <p>  I will stop now because I want to give others the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ignatius Aphrem II"},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Time is very much against us.

He reminded us to take a bouquet of red flowers as a gift to the opposition so that they would come back with us.<\/p><p>I went to the places where the opposition were and I was able to bring back 2,000 opponents and they returned to their jobs.

If committee members had seen how Christian children wearing their Christmas clothes were killed by the opposition's bombs.  I will give the names of 4,000 people, half of whom were children and women, who were killed by the opposition's bombs in Aleppo.  Give me the names of the civilians killed by the Syrian army.  On that Christmas Day I went on television and asked the Syrian army to kill immediately any opponent who bombed civilians.  The media stated the Grand Mufti of Syria pronounced a fatwa to destroy Aleppo but they did not see the churches and children being killed.  I invite Senator Bacik and committee members to visit Syria if they want peace, and to meet Bashar al Assad, after which they can judge him and we will accept the judgment.

I hope it is not too stilted.<\/p> <p>  Liberated Aleppo is falling.  The suburbs of Damascus are falling, or have already fallen, and are being cleansed of their recalcitrant population.  The families of foreign militiamen are moving into these areas that have been cleansed.  Silence is returning to a devastated and demographically changed Syria.  This presentation is therefore more a lament for the defeated Syrian revolution, and for our failure to help it, than a policy recommendation.  However, there are recommendations at the end.<\/p> <p>  Here is a summary of what I think has happened.  From spring 2011, in the context of the Arab Spring, millions from all backgrounds protested peacefully against torture, crony capitalism, corruption and poverty, and for freedom, dignity and social justice.  They called for the unity of all sects and ethnicities.<\/p> <p>  The Assad regime responded with extreme repression, shooting protestors dead, torturing many, including children, to death, and prosecuting a mass rape campaign.  By summer 2012 it had provoked an armed uprising of military defectors and civilian volunteers grouped under the umbrella term \"Free Syrian Army\".  Of course, the Free Syrian Army was never one thing.  It comprises about 1,000 militias under this umbrella.  They are all widely different.  Most of them are locally based and so on.<\/p> <p>  The regime deliberately started a war because it knew a serious reform process would end in its demise.  It calculated, correctly, that in a war situation it could count on strong foreign allies, unlike its opponents.  It was following the blueprint laid out by Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez.  In the late 1970s he had met a widely based challenge, including communists, leftists, liberals, democrats, nationalists as well as Islamists, with severe repression.  This provoked a desperate armed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama in 1982.  The regime responded by razing the city centre, killing tens of thousands.  The memory of this destruction kept Syrians silent for the next three decades.  This is the model for what is happening now.  They have done it before and it has worked before.<\/p> <p>  Once it had started a war, the regime deliberately sectarianised the war, for divide-and-rule purposes, and actively encouraged the rise of Sunni jihadism to present itself internationally as the lesser evil.  The notion that we have on the one hand a secular regime and on the other mad jihadists is wrong in all kinds of ways.  The way in which it is most wrong is that it fails to recognise how the regime itself has been working very deliberately and very hard to build a jihadist opposition.<\/p> <p>  In 2011, while the regime was detaining and torturing tens of thousands of non-violent protestors, it released 1,500 Salafi jihadists from its prisons.  These are the people it had helped to go to Iraq to fight the American occupation and, more to the point, to fight the Shia population during the American occupation of Iraq.  When these people came back to Syria, they were all put in prison and kept there until the regime needed them again in 2011.  These people include Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, Zahran Alloush, the founder of Jaysh al-Islam, and Hassan Abboud, the founder of Ahrar al-Sham, as well as many senior people in ISIS-Daesh.  These people were in prison in 2011 and were then released.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, the regime organised a string of sectarian massacres on the plain between Homs and Hama where Sunnis and Alawis live side by side.  In each, the army shelled a rebellious Sunni village, then irregular Alawi young men moved in to cut the throats of women and children.  The aim - it was successful - was to stir an anti-Alawi backlash among the Sunni majority, which in turn would scare Alawis into loyalty to the regime.  Out of fear rather than conviction, most but not all Alawi have remained loyal.  Assad and a large majority of his security chiefs are from the Alawi minority.<\/p> <p>  The regime practised a scorched earth policy on the areas it could not control, burning the civilian infrastructure and driving millions out.  This provided the vacuum in which transnational jihadist groups could thrive.<\/p> <p>  The Assad regime has old links with Daesh-ISIS, having helped set up its previous incarnation, the Islamic State, in Iraq.  For more than a year after it set up in Raqqa, Daesh and Assad did not fight each other.  Even today, when the Free Syrian Army is fighting Daesh, the regime bombs the Free Syrian Army.  An arsonist dressed up as a fireman, Assad has used Daesh, an enemy of the Syrian revolution, to present himself as the \"lesser evil\" although he is responsible for far more killing.  Russia used Daesh as an excuse for its bombing, but over 80% of Russian bombs have fallen on the revolutionary areas, not on Daesh territory.<\/p> <p>  Even in these conditions, the Syrian revolution survived.  Still today half of rebel fighters fall under the loose Free Syrian Army umbrella.<\/p><p>This means they are non-ideological in the sense that they are fighting only to defend their communities, to bring down the regime and to allow the people to decide what comes next.  In other words, they are not fighting to impose a particular vision of, for example, an Islamic state on the people.<\/p><p> The revolution is represented by civilians more than by its fighting man, and this is what one hardly ever hears about in the media.  At the heart of what is happening in Syria is what civilians are doing.  It is the civilians who started the revolution; the fighters came afterwards in response to Assad's repression.<\/p><p> In areas liberated of Assad and Daesh, Syrians have set up hundreds of local and provincial councils, half of which are directly elected by the men and women of the area and the other half of which are quasi-democratic, practising various forms of internal and community voting and consensus.  Let us not hear anything about the Arabs needing a strong man because they are not capable of doing democracy as in the most difficult of circumstances, when they are under attack by everybody, they are actually practising democracy.<\/p><p> Women's centres, educational health projects and independent trade unions have been established.  In a country once called a kingdom of silence, there are more than 60 free newspapers and dozens of free radio and television stations.  This is what is being destroyed today.  East Aleppo now has the largest concentration of civil society organisations, democratic councils and everything from educational projects to theatre groups, and these people are being slaughtered as we speak.<\/p><p> Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey provided arms to some sections of the opposition, but in an inefficient, disorganised and insufficient manner, and for the wrong reasons.  For example, the Saudis and the Qataris are primarily concerned with their geopolitical conflict with Iran rather than the good of the Syrian people.<\/p><p> Far from this being a western regime change plot, as many here choose to believe, President Obama's most significant act was to veto the Qataris, Saudis and Turks from delivering the defensive anti-aircraft weapons the opposition so desperately needed.  I have never called for weapons to be given to the opposition so it could invade Assad's home village or his palace in Damascus.  The people need anti-aircraft weapons not to conquer new areas but to defend themselves from the scorched earth policy.  President Obama vetoed that.<\/p><p> President Obama prioritised his deal lifting sanctions on Iran in return for nuclear compliance and implicitly recognised what he called Iranian assets in Syria.  After the 2013 sarin gas attack, President Obama's red line vanished and the US took to treating Syria as an extension of the so-called war on terror which, of course, vastly increased the appeal of terrorist groups in the Middle East.  Donald Trump seems set to continue on this course, but probably with less rhetoric and dressing.<\/p><p> Iran and Russia have intervened on a massive scale.  Some 80% of the pro-Assad ground troops attacking liberated Aleppo are foreign Shia jihadists, organised and commanded by Iran.  They come from Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.  Assad controlled less than a fifth of the national territory before Russia's savage imperialist assault.  Assad's army has not won a battle by itself for years.  By now, its most effective units answer to local warlords rather than a central hierarchy.  Again, the idea of stabilising the country by giving it back to the central Syrian state is an absurdity, because there is no central Syrian state left.<\/p><p> In the west in general we failed to understand the revolution, offer solidarity or even see through propaganda.  It is quite shameful that earlier today propagandists from the regime sat where I am now.  It has been noted in the Arab and Muslim worlds and will not be forgotten.  It is one thing to invite a group of civilians who are pro-Assad, are worried about the revolution and think that it is the best idea to stick with Assad to appear before the committee.  Those people need to be heard and talked to.  However, having the representative of a genocide speaking here when the genocide is at its height, a man who has called for an army of suicide bombers to hit Europe and a man who has repeatedly called for the civilians in Aleppo to be murdered because they are all terrorists is shocking.  I have gone off course, but those comments were shocking and have been noted.<\/p><p> In the west we failed to offer solidarity or even to see through propaganda.  The right saw the revolution and counter-revolution in outmoded security terms, and so did much of the left, wasting time with conspiracy theories, Orientalist myths about eternal sectarian conflicts and the rest of it, and inaccurate common territories on proxy war chests such as this being a re-run of Iraq.  It is ridiculous.  We will live with the consequences of this.  Walter Benjamin wrote that behind every fascism is a failed revolution.  New forms of fascism are rising in the east and west, including here in Europe, as a result of our collective failure. <\/p><p> What should Ireland's Government do?  In many ways, it is now far too late to do anything.  It should not be inviting propagandists for genocide to speak to it.  Civilian protection should be an urgent and immediate priority.  At least 500,000 people have been killed in Syria, over 90% at the hands of the regime and its backers.  The figure of 94% comes from the Syrian network for human rights, which is considered to be very reliable because it does not write down only the name of the person killed, but also details including the place, date and so on, and all of the information is verified.  Some 94% of civilian, not military, casualties were caused by the Assad regime and its backers.<\/p><p> This is the lesser evil.  Some 12 million people, or more than half of the population, have been displaced.  Humanitarian assistance is absolutely essential but insufficient.  Ireland should call strongly for a ceasefire, safe zones, prisoner releases - hundreds of thousands of people have disappeared into the Assad gulag - and for sieges to end.  Currently, 1 million people are under starvation siege in Syria.  As much diplomatic and economic pressure as possible should be brought to bear on Russia and Iran to deter their assaults.  Russia should, for instance, be excluded from the SWIFT banking system for its repeated war crimes, employing incendiary and cluster bombs and bunker busters on civilian areas and targeting schools, hospitals and aid convoys, including the United Nations aid convoy.<\/p><p> Iran's Shia occupation forces in Sunni majority Syria are one direct cause of the rise of Sunni jihadism.  Ireland had a sectarian problem that was linked to imperialism.  It can surely understand that if one uses Catholics to police Protestants and Protestants to police Catholics, and then brings foreign Protestants to police Catholics, one may well have an angry Catholic backlash.  It is human nature.  Shia forces are not just policing people; they are murdering them.<\/p><p> Irish investment in Iran which, I hear, is speeding up, should be suspended until Iran removes these forces from Syria.  This is in the interests of the security of Europe.  If one does not care about people in Syria, surely one should care about people in Europe.  Giving Sunni jihadists and identity groups an excuse for their narrative is not a good idea from a European point of view.<\/p><p> War criminals should be prosecuted.  Even if it is not happening today, people believe that eventually war criminals should be prosecuted.  Maybe that would deter them a little.<\/p><p> Ireland should settle many more refugees and work with other states to address the plight of permanently exiled refugees.  We have a problem, in that the mood in the west in general, and in Europe in particular, is dramatically anti-refugee and anti-immigrant.  People are scared of refugees, in particular those from the Arab and Muslim world.  However, if we are now looking at an Assad or Iranian and Russian victory in Syria this means that millions of people will never return.  That is the reality with which we have to start dealing.<\/p><p> For example, most of the city of Homs, which was conquered and pacified by the regime in 2012, is still entirely depopulated and its residents are in camps in Lebanon and Turkey.  That is a model for the future of Syria because these people know that if they return their sons will be arrested and tortured, their houses will never be rebuilt and so on.  <\/p><p> In the medium term, Ireland needs to work out how to deal with what is, in effect, a foreign occupation in Syria.  The armed rebellion will continue as a long-term moral insurgency.  I do not know what will happen, but it is possible now that the revolution has been driven out of the cities we can discuss the end of the revolution.  There will no longer be democratic councils, newspapers and so on.  It may well be the case that Syria will be increasingly dominated by jihadists.<\/p><p>Groups such as Nusra and Hara al-Sham will increasingly dominate the insurgency, as it will become.  The war is not ending.  The revolution, it looks like, is now in its last days.  This will, in Syria, be framed as a national liberation struggle.<\/p><p> Ireland and others will have to be prepared for the jihadism and sectarian conflict unleashed by the tragedy.  Symbolically, Syria is an immensely important part of the Muslim world and of the Arab world and the fact that it is occupied by foreign Shia jihadists and Russian imperialists is a development which will have major ramifications in the coming decades.  Jihadists will be immeasurably strengthened by the defeat of the revolution in the urban areas, to the same extent that democratic revolutionaries will be weakened.  This moment &ndash; the fall of Syria's Sunni-majority cities to Russian bombers and an international Shia alliance, facilitated by the West &ndash; will mark a new stage in the development of jihadism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Yassin-Kassab","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Robin Yassin-Kassab.

He is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Yassin-Kassab offers a bleak outlook.  We would all share his distress at seeing what has happened in Syria and as the Chair has said, particularly at seeing the carnage inflicted on the civilian population.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether Mr. Yassin-Kassab had the opportunity to hear the exchanges earlier where some of us challenged what we were hearing from the group that was in with us at that point.  I will ask him to comment on some of what they said.  Perhaps I will repeat what they said and ask Mr. Yassin-Kassab to comment.  First, one of them mounted an attack on the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and described it as a one-man operation.  Could Mr. Yassin-Kassab comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Second, they asked about the lifting of sanctions.  I, among others, pointed out to them that sanctions had been imposed on the Syrian regime, and, indeed, on Russia also, because of international condemnation of the attacks of the Syrian regime and its Russian allies on civilians, and we had an exchange about that.  I wonder whether Mr. Yassin-Kassab could comment on what he sees as the effectiveness of sanctions.  Mr. Yassin-Kassab spoke, in particular, on the need to expand sanctions against Russia, in terms of the banking system and exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, and maybe he could say a little more about that.<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Yassin-Kassab also say something in response to the comments made by one of the speakers earlier that there is no moderate opposition in Syria?  Mr. Yassin-Kassab has already countered that.  Indeed, when I was challenging them on that, I put to them that we would be hearing from Mr. Yassin-Kassab and that Mr. Yassin-Kassab had a clear view, which is widely shared in the international community, that there was a clear moderate non-violent opposition as part of the Arab Spring originally, in 2011, that it was the start of the anti-Assad revolution but, unfortunately, as Mr. Yassin-Kassab said, it has been attacked from so many sides since, but notably by the regime, that it is now in disarray.<\/p> <p>  I pointed out to the speakers earlier that when we had the Russian ambassador in with us a number of weeks ago, he had spoken of local peace agreements being conducted by Russia with moderate Opposition groups around Syria which had led to peace in certain areas.  Can Mr. Yassin-Kassab comment on that, and on whether that offers any prospect for any sort of peace to be more widespread?<\/p> <p>  Finally, many of us have been utterly condemnatory of the Syrian regime's brutality over many years and well before the 2011 revolution, and of the complicity of Russia and of Iran in supporting the Syrian regime.  Does Mr. Yassin-Kassab see any prospect for the renewal of the United Nations-led effort to renew political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and the UN Security Council Resolution 2254?  That is one of Ireland's key objectives in Syria.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been clear that Ireland has been seeking to ensure protection of the civilian population.  Indeed, we have contributed &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance in the past four years.  We have been demanding legal accountability for war crimes.  In particular, we are seeking to see that peace process restarted and we have been clear that a large obstacle to the restarting of that has been that Assad's regime has sought to undermine every effort to reach a negotiated resolution to the conflict since 2011.  As I am a member of the Labour Party, I do not speak for the Irish Government.  Ireland has made a clear position that Assad's regime has undermined efforts to achieve a negotiated peace.  We put that to the delegation this morning and refuted the delegation's suggestion inherent in much of what it stated that the regime wants peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#Q00900","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik.

We cannot separate foreign policy from security policy, domestic policy and European policy in this issue.  That is what I am saying.<\/p> <p>  I still think it was unfortunate.  It was not the committee that invited them but it is unfortunate that they came in.<\/p><p>However, I think it is good that everybody hears from all kinds of groups in Syria, including people who do not like the revolution and people still loyal to Assad, but not from official propagandists.  This is a state-organised thing and this specific person has threatened things that would get most Muslims banned from ever arriving in Europe.<br\/><br\/>I was asked what &quot;It has been noted&quot; means.  It was not a threat.  It simply means that it has been noted.  I know that, yesterday, <i>Asharq Al-Awsat<\/i>newspaper, maybe the biggest pan-Arab newspaper, and <i>Al-Quds Al-Arabi<\/i>newspaper were reporting on it.  I know of those two reports, and I have heard from people saying they are shocked and disgusted by this - that is all.  It is not just this committee, it is also Trinity College, and I think this person has gone off to sign some declaration against extremism today, which is a sad joke.  That is what &quot;It has been noted&quot; means.  It just means that Arabs and Muslims know about this and some of them are very upset about it.<br\/><br\/>In response to the issues the committee went over with the delegation this morning, in particular the issue of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, I do not have a problem with what they said.  I agree that it is not terribly reliable.  The one I quoted earlier was the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which I believe is very reliable.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is very often quoted on the BBC and by all kinds of people.  It is based in Manchester, I think, or London, and it is really a one-man affair.  Sometimes its information seems good and sometimes it seems very strange.  I do not think it has the people on the ground to be absolutely sure of the information it comes up with.  I do not know whose side it is on but I do not disagree with what the delegation said in that respect, namely, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is not terribly reliable.<br\/><br\/>On sanctions, I did not see the session this morning or the transcript of proceedings, but I gather that what they came to say was that sanctions are hurting poor people in Syria so they should be stopped.  The sanctions on Syria are not like the sanctions on Iraq in the old days.  The sanctions on Iraq were total blanket sanctions which hurt everybody.  One could not have a pencil in a classroom in Iraq because the graphite might be dual use and could be used in weapons production.  The sanctions on Syria are nothing like that in that they are very targeted.  What is hurting the poor in Syria is Assad's war and, specifically, starvation sieges.  There are also Assad's checkpoints which charge bribes and so on.  If a bag of tea goes through a checkpoint, then the price dramatically increases on the other side because the man in charge of that checkpoint takes his big cut on it, and that happens several times, so prices are inflated.  It is because of checkpoints and because of the regime's behaviour and corruption.  The sanctions are not hurting the poor; the Syrian regime is hurting the poor.  I think the sanctions should be expanded.<br\/><br\/>While I do not want to go off-topic, I believe Russia needs to be sanctioned much more than it is at the moment, again, in the interests of Europe, not just for the sake of Syria.  I know Ukraine is a complicated issue and there is all kinds of blame to go around, but, nevertheless, having Putin annex part of the country unilaterally without any negotiations and promoting a hot war in another third of the country, in the heart of Europe, is something very dramatic which we should be taking more seriously.<br\/><br\/>Putin is attacking the European Union through Syria by deliberately creating tens of thousands of new refugees and, at the same time, having very good relations with and, in some cases, funding right-wing anti-immigrant parties throughout Europe.  This is designed to make the EU break up.  That is his policy; it is not a mistake that he is doing these things at the same time.  Therefore, I believe sanctions should be expanded.  I do not want a war with Russia.  I also do not want a war with Iran, which is why I wish that economic and diplomatic means would be used much more than they are being used at present.  Certainly, the idea of opening new business with countries like Iran when it is directly threatening the stability of the Middle East and, therefore, of Europe does not seem sensible to me.<br\/><br\/>In the context of there being no moderate opposition left, obviously I disagree.  It is true there is less moderate opposition now than there was a year ago, and a year ago there was less than two years ago, and so on.  Every day there is a bit less moderate opposition because people are being driven out of the country.  In many cases, it is the better educated, more able people who leave as they have more money or skills, such as language skills, and they are better able to get out.  The people stuck in Syria very often are the poorest of the poor, because one needs money to get out of the country.  Even to get to a refugee camp in Jordan or Turkey, a person needs a couple of hundred dollars to pay a smuggler to get them through checkpoints and over a border.  Many people do not have that money.<br\/><br\/>A few years ago there were over 700 local councils in Syria.  That then went down to 400, which is the latest figure I have.  After the latest advances of Assad and his friends, it is probably less than that, at something like 350.  These, by definition, are moderate and non-ideological.  There is a huge range of different kinds of councils.  Some of them simply have the heads of families or tribal leaders in a neighbourhood nominate somebody from their family, and that person will be on the council.  In other areas it is a straightforward democratic election, such as we recognise.  In other areas it is even more complicated than that, in that all the farmers, or shopkeepers, or students vote among themselves for one representative, so there are representatives from different trade and social backgrounds, and so on.  The members of these councils might be communists, Islamists or democrats.  In a way, it is irrelevant because the reason they have been chosen for the position is usually that they are known to be a reliable person and have a specific skill, or know something about, say, fixing the electricity or getting the water back on after it has been bombed, or about education, so they can organise underground schools away from the bombs.  These are non-ideological organisations and they are working in a democratic way.  They are self-organised communities, working on practical things.  They are not working on the ultimate aim of spreading Islam all over the globe; they are working on getting the electricity back on, educating the children and getting the health service working in difficult circumstances.<br\/><br\/>What more than that does one want?  There are still tens of newspapers, television stations and radio stations in a country which Riad al-Turk called a &quot;kingdom of silence&quot;, where six years ago there were no independent newspapers, radio stations or television stations, and if one published anything that was not official, one would be in a hell of a lot of trouble.  The moderate opposition does exist.  It exists inside the country, under fire, it exists in refugee camps and in cities like Gaziantep and Istanbul in Turkey, and nowadays it exists in Berlin and places around Europe as well.<br\/><br\/>Very many of those people want to go home.  The overwhelmingly vast majority of Syrians want to go home.  Not only that, if they have to be outside their own country, they would rather be in Jordan, Lebanon or Turkey than in Europe in most cases.  The reason they are risking the journey across the sea is that they do not have any opportunities in those places.  In the camps there is no education for their children, no work and no future.  They can put up with that situation for a year or two, if they think they are going to go home in the end.  However, when it goes on for five or six years, and it looks like they are never going to go home, then people think, &quot;What can I do?  I am going to risk everything to try for a future in which I can at least work and educate my children.&quot;<\/p><p>These people want to go home and build again but it is not safe for them.  It looks like it will not be for a long time.<\/p><p> I do not like Russia's definition of moderate opposition and local peace agreements.  Its definition of moderate opposition is somebody who will do business with it.  Anybody who will not do business with Russia or wants it or Assad out is by its definition a terrorist.  That includes the democrats who I have been talking about.  I do think Russia is the wrong person to be going about the idea of local peace agreements.  There is a difference between peace and pacification.  What we are getting at the moment is pacification.  There will be some kind of peace, to an extent, in certain areas because one can do that.  One can bomb the hell out of an area, make 90% of the people leave and then force the 10% left to sign some deal whereby they will be quiet, hand over their weapons and bow their heads.  That is not long-term peace, however.  It does not stop the long-term insurgency, which will continue, the jihadism or anything else.<\/p><p> Local peace agreements, however, would be part of the real solution.  I am not looking for a total victory of the revolution.  Even a year ago that would have been unrealistic to expect.  For example, the Alawi towns near the coast, which are around the president's home village, are completely loyal to the regime.  There is no point trying to take over those villages as it would be an imposition on those people.  If those people want to stick with the system they have, then they should be allowed to stick with it.  If Assad had been driven out of Damascus and went back to his home village, one would imagine that he and his generals would have taken weapons with them to defend their villages.  Then one would have had local agreements whereby over ten years every group would have kept their weapons but stopped shooting at each other.  Then, maybe after a certain point, they could start travelling into each other's areas and do business with each other.  Local peace agreements would have been an important part of a solution if we were looking at a real solution.<\/p><p> Decentralisation would also have been an important part of a real solution.  That would have meant more power to the local councils which had begun to build up.  Even in the areas which are still with the regime, the people there may want to build their own councils.  Syria has polarised communities and areas because of what has happened.  If there was more decentralisation, in a conservative place, like Deir ez-Zor or Hama, one could have a local government which could decide to ban alcohol, while in another town with a larger Christian-Alawi mixed community, a more liberal, modern, urban community, its council may decide to allow alcohol and have nightclubs.  The two communities could still be living together under the Syrian umbrella.  It would help Kurds and Arabs live together because many people in the Rojava areas under the PYD, Democratic Union Party, want some form of autonomy.  I think they should be able to have that.<\/p><p> Is there any chance of going back to United Nations-led process?  Eventually, if there was going to be a real solution to this, of course, there have to be negotiations and the United Nations would be involved.  United Nations negotiations over recent years have not gone anywhere.  People keep saying there is no military solution in Syria.  Unfortunately, Assad, Russia and Iran do not agree with that.  They believe there is a military solution and they are prosecuting it.  One is not going to get serious negotiations until the military balance is changed.  That is not the same as saying there is a military solution and the outside world should get rid of Assad by bombing him.  Instead, there needs to be pressure to make it more expensive for Russia and Iran, not for Assad because he has already lost.  Their occupation of Syria has to be made much more expensive diplomatically and mainly economically.  This is where Russia is weak.  Its economy is not in a strong state.  If people in the West wanted to, they could put a lot more strain on the Russian economy.  If the military or economic equation was really changed, then they would feel they should negotiate and then there could be a serious negotiation, which would be good for everybody concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#Q02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Yassin-Kassab","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The inability to get humanitarian aid and medical supplies to the people most in need was referred to earlier.

That is one way which could stop the appeal of travelling across the Mediterranean Sea for those stuck in those places.  In Jordan, they speak the same language as Syrians.  For a Syrian, culturally it is not difficult and is easier to get around Jordan.  They would rather be there.  The problem is they are stuck in a camp where there is no economy, no work, and no proper schools.  Accordingly, they have no future for their children.  For generations, Syrians have admired education, and if they have an opportunity, they really take it up.  For them, it is the idea that not only is their life ruined, but their kids are going to grow up illiterate and not have a skill.  All Syrians will say they wanted their son to be a doctor but now he cannot even read properly.<\/p><p>Building schools in the camps and investing money in such a way that it will create jobs in these places would be helpful.  There will have to be a great deal of discussion about the long-term future of these camps and about the provision of a great deal of help for Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.  Lebanon and Jordan are small countries that are quite unstable already.  Lebanon is quite remarkable in that it has not collapsed into civil war as a result of what is happening in Syria.  We need to think about that.  Zaatari camp is now the third biggest city in Jordan.   It seems this guy is staying in Syria and therefore in 20 years time it looks like that camp may well be the third biggest city in Jordan.  It will be like the Palestinian camps.  In 1950 to 1952 the camps there comprised tents and it seemed the people would return home in a few years but in the place of those tents there are now multistorey concrete buildings in densely packed urban areas.  That <\/p><p>may well be what will happen with these camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and they may spread along the borders just inside Syria.  I have been just inside Syria on its border with Turkey and every few kilometres along it one sees another camp settlement.  It will be interesting to see what will happen there.  They may become permanent and perhaps Turkey will get the job of protecting them.  I do not know if Turkey will deter Assad's planes from coming and bombing those camps.  I am not sure what will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016120100002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Yassin-Kassab","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480582800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>What is Mr. Yassin-Kassab's view on the future governance of Syria?

I am not qualified enough about the local scene to give an opinion but this is a Syrian problem for the Syrian people and that is why I do not like the likes of Russia interfering.

I absolutely believe that.  That is the basis of any serious solution.  There needs to be a transition and all the different voices, communities and perspectives in Syria and people who are scared of different people need to be involved in that.  I am not talking about political actors but every community has genuine concerns.  For example, in the case of the Alawis who are loyal to the regime, a small minority of them are loyal because they are paid up believers, but most of them are loyal because they are scared the Sunni majority will have a revenge on them in general, a generalised revenge.  They are scared of groups like the Islamic State and of Jabhat al-Nusra for good reason.  These people need to have guarantees that their community will not be attacked so that they feel safe to go forward with a transition.  There needs to be a transitional government, a movement towards some kind of power-sharing or eventually elections in which people choose what will come next.  Assad is in power, the Russians and the Iranians have kept him in power and I wish I could say and here is a new proposal: why does Assad not stay in power but give people X, Y and Z?  I am afraid I cannot give the members a nice happy answer.  As somebody of Syrian origin who has family members and many friends there and who is attached to the place, I wish I could but I cannot see any happy end to this.  My analysis of the situation is that this is not going to end and it will continue for a very long time.  It may well be that now that the revolution has been kicked out of the cities it really will become Jihadist insurgency almost entirely that will hurt us here too.  <\/p> <p>  With respect to the sectarianism in the Middle East, I think we have not seen anything yet.  We have now got a chain of wars with sectarian aspects to them in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, although it is quiet, and it is spreading all over the place.  The change in the power balance between Iran and other countries in the region is affecting this.  I am afraid I cannot give the Chairman a happy answer.  I would love to be able to but I cannot.  I have said what I believe should be part of the solution, namely, decentralisation, a bigger role for local government, local ceasefires and a United Nations-led negotiation aiming for a transition but without something changing the military or economic balance against Assad and primarily Russia and Iran we are not going to get there.<\/p><p>It seems to me that Russia and Iran are happy with a kind of permanent managed war in the Middle East, but it is not good for us.  It is not good for the Middle East, it is not good for Europe and it is not good for the world.<\/p><p> I disagree with Deputy Barrett's comments on Assad.  The Deputy is correct in saying Assad has some Syrian support.  He has support for a range of reasons, whether fear or love.  However, he does not have enough support to get people to fight for him.  As I said, 80% of the ground troops surrounding Aleppo are not Syrian.  I ask the committee to consider that.  The most effective fighting groups in the Syrian army now are groups such as the Desert Hawks, for example, which is loyal to a man called Suheil al-Hassan, who is a warlord from the Hama area.  His fighting men are loyal to him, not to Bashar al-Assad or to the Syrian state.  Yes, there are people who still want to stick with Assad, but supposedly loyal people are trying to leave the country rather than fight for him.  He cannot find fighting men any more.

As indicated, I am chief executive officer of Ulster Bank Ireland, a role I commenced on 1 June this year.  Before joining Ulster Bank I was CEO of Danske Bank in Northern Ireland, having previously held other senior positions in Danske Bank as well as Bank of Ireland and McKinsey &amp;amp; Company Management Consultants.  I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Paul Stanley, chief finance officer, and Mr. Andrew Blair, head of problem debt management, at Ulster Bank Ireland, DAC.  We thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, Ulster Bank is a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and accordingly it is subject to the normal disclosure constraints of a publicly quoted company, although I do not believe this will unduly constrain our responses to the committee this morning.  With the agreement of the committee, I will read my opening statement relatively quickly, following which I will respond to any specific issues the committee wants to address.<\/p> <p>  The following are themes I would like to convey to the committee.  First, Ulster Bank is a strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base.  We provide important and much-needed services to Irish customers on a business and personal basis.  We also provide competition in the Irish banking market.  Second, while the post-crisis recovery continues there are market head winds to consider, including a low interest rate environment, the impact of Brexit and a challenging regulatory cost environment.  Third, we continue to work hard to address our legacy issues.  While we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate that there is more to do.  Fourth, we are looking with determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible, leveraging the strength of RBS and key market opportunities that exist.<\/p> <p>  I would like now to expand on each of these four points, starting with our strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base.  Ulster Bank has been providing banking services in Ireland for the past 180 years.  It is unique as the only systemic bank that operates in the Republic of Ireland that is owned by a parent with international reach.  RBS has confirmed that Ulster Bank remains an integral part of its plan to build a leading retail and commercial bank, substantially focused in the UK and Ireland.  Ulster Bank employs over 3,000 people, it has a network of 110 branches and it serves almost 1.1 million personal and business customers.  It has net lending of in excess of &euro;22.6 billion in the Irish economy and it holds circa &euro;17.5 billion in customer deposits.  Despite operating in a low interest rate environment, it continues to make good progress in the strengthening of its business.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 to date has been a strong customer focused period for Ulster Bank.  We reported an adjusted operating profit of &euro;236 million to end September 2016 and we are demonstrating steady progress through increasing income and reducing our operating costs.  Following the announcement by Ulster Bank to pay a &euro;1.5 billion dividend to its parent company, it maintains a strong capital position.  Our results reinforce our progress in building a strong and sustainable business as RBS in Ireland.  We have a shared ambition across RBS to become the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.  By advocacy I mean word of mouth recommendations that generate new business and relationships based not on what we say but on what we do and how we treat our customers.  We believe that we are making progress on this ambition.  We are growing market share in terms of flow of new business, particularly in the mortgage market, and our customer net promoter scores continue to rise, reflecting the level of service we provide to our customers.  We continue to invest in our customers and people and in reinforcing our brand presence.<\/p> <p>  While the post-crisis recovery continues there are market head winds that need to be considered in our outlook.  There is no doubt, as indicated as recently at last week by the CSO data, that the post-crisis recovery continues.  However, while the macroeconomic outlook remains favourable it is not as favourable or as certain as it was prior to the UK referendum or US election results.  We are also operating in a low interest rate environment which is impacting all banks' deposit margins and our returns on deposit funds remain at historically negative lows.  The recent UK vote to leave the EU is also likely to have a negative impact on the Irish economy, in our view, predominantly affecting exports and investment.  In addition, we continue to pay increasing Government and regulatory levies which already represent circa 9% of our total cost base and which adversely impacts our cost income ratio by approximately 7%.<\/p><p>On a more positive note however, the decision of the UK to exit the European Union has strengthened and reinforced the strategic importance of Ulster Bank to RBS.  As a bank regulated in Ireland, in a post-Brexit scenario Ulster Bank has a unique position within RBS.<\/p><p> The third area concerns addressing our legacy issues.  As part of our progress to build a sustainable business, there are a number of legacy issues which we continue to manage and which impact on our customers and our recovery.  This includes our work, under the direction of the Central Bank of Ireland, to address issues identified in our tracker mortgage portfolio of customers.  We are focused on completing this very complex piece of work and ensuring that we do the right thing for our customers, sorting these legacy issues out so that our focus can be on building a strong business and rebuilding the trust of customers, the pride of our people and the support of our stakeholders.<\/p><p> In the course of our discussion today, we can touch on any of these issues members want to discuss.  However, one area they have already indicated they want to talk to us about is mortgage arrears.  From the outset it is important to restate that our objective has been, and remains, to keep customers in their homes.  As we have previously indicated to the committee, there is a cost to living in a home.  Where customers engage meaningfully with us we can provide, and have in the vast majority of cases provided, a solution to keep them in their home.  We have made significant progress addressing and resolving outstanding arrears issues and to date we have supported over 22,000 customers who are experiencing difficulties to stay in their home.<\/p><p> In terms of loan sales, I remind the committee that Ulster Bank was not part of NAMA and therefore never benefitted from having impaired assets removed from our balance sheet, unlike the other domestic banks in this market.  As a result, we have undertaken a number of loan sales as part of our recovery, with the full knowledge of our regulators, both the Central Bank and the ECB, which have encouraged these processes to address what is a key issue for Irish banks in bringing the volume of non-performing loans in line with acceptable market norms.  These types of sales are an essential part of our recovery and enable not just Ulster Bank but all other financial institutions to strengthen our balance sheets, reduce our risk profile and enable us to facilitate lending and growth back into the economy for both personal and commercial customers.<\/p><p> We are firmly of the view that the future of Ulster Bank must be built on customer trust and integrity to ensure we are a powerful and competitive presence in this market.  Having been in recovery mode, we are now moving into a new phase of our business where we are focused on our customers and transforming our business, unlocking the potential that we know exists, investing in the future and running the bank efficiently.  Our clear purpose and ambition is to be the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.  Running our business in a responsible, sustainable and efficient way is at the core of that ambition.<\/p><p> To the end of September 2016, our lending activity increased by 26% year on year, with &euro;970 million of new lending facilities to business customers and a further &euro;810 million in personal lending.  Our new mortgage lending is up 49% compared with the third quarter of 2015, with our market share of new mortgage lending increasing by 4% on last year, which is very positive in a competitive market.  Our new service-led improvements to customer experience, such as mobile mortgage managers and secure video chat, have increased Ulster Bank's market share to 19% in the third quarter of 2016.  Our broad range of fixed and variable rates, which are available to both new and existing customers, are both comprehensive and competitive.<\/p><p> We are also gaining market share in agribusiness with a range of propositions and services to support and grow our customer base in this important sector.  A total of 34 of our agrispecialists will graduate this week from our unique tailored agriculture programme, designed to provide the best support to our agricustomers.  We have been out on the road all of this year talking and listening to business customers and providing support on everything from exporting to new markets, expanding organic SME businesses, the impact of Brexit and innovation in farming.  We have also started to offer finance under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p><p> We are working in an operating environment that is changing fast.  International and global events, such as Brexit or various EU or international trade issues, lower-for-longer interest rates, affect the economic environment and, in turn, our customers regardless of the outcomes.  We are focused on transforming our organisation to ensure it is fully prepared to meet these challenges in the short and long term.  As part of this transformation, we need to factor in the issues of strong competition and innovation from both banks and other non-traditional competitors.  Technical innovation, shifting consumer trends, changing demographics and increased regulatory requirements highlight the need to continuously adapt our way of working to ensure a customer-focused sustainable response and strong financial performance.  It is clear from the ongoing developments in technology and the customer response that products, services and distribution channels need to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that we meet and are responsive to customer needs.<\/p><p> The next era in banking is defined not just by the financial products or services delivered, but by who delivers them, how they reach customers and how they meet their needs.  Central to this is the application of rapidly developing technology at both the retail and wholesale levels.  These latest developments, led in the main by FinTech startups, pose challenges for market participants and regulators alike, particularly in balancing the potential benefits of innovation with the possible risks of new approaches.  It is clear, however, that the evolving banking and payments landscape requires collaboration among financial service providers, regulators, policy makers and FinTech companies to help foster the evolution of this area.  Ulster Bank, supported by our international parent RBS, is central to this collaboration.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I reiterate that our ambition in Ulster Bank is to become the number one bank for customer service in Ireland.  We have a strong franchise with an established market position and loyal customer base.  While the post-crisis recovery continues, there are market headwinds which need to be considered in our outlook.  We continue to work hard to address our legacy issues and while we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate there is more to do.  We are looking with both determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible and leveraging the strength of RBS for the key market opportunities that exist.<\/p><p> We look forward to continuing our progress in 2017 and beyond.  Mr. Andrew Blair, Mr. Paul Stanley and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Mr. Mallon spoke of Brexit and the strategic importance of Ulster Bank within the RBS group.

The future is very uncertain and there are all sorts of permutations, as well as speculation on what the impact might be.  It certainly casts a question over the issue of the passporting of banking capability across borders.  RBS has less of international presence than it had in the past but it does have customers and services which operate internationally so it needs to think about what its options might be should passporting rights be lost.

The background to the initial allegations relating to this were made by Dr. Laurence Tomlinson in the UK.  Those allegations were that the bank put companies into the global restructuring group in some artificial distressed manner.  Those allegations were independently investigated by Clifford Chance, a firm of solicitors, in the UK and by Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, another firm of solicitors, in Ireland.  Those investigations showed no foundation for the argument that those customers were put in on a basis that was not appropriate.  Since then, the Financial Conduct Authority has conducted its own investigation.  That process is not yet complete and the authority's review has not been published.  However, on 8 November, RBS announced that it was taking its own action pending the outcome of that review.  The Financial Conduct Authority noted on that date that no evidence was found in the review that is ongoing that the bank had artificially engineered a position to cause customers to transfer to a global restructuring group, that any customers exhibiting signs of difficulty that went into a global restructuring group were exhibiting clear signs of difficulty and that there was no widespread practice of transferring companies for inappropriate reasons.  There was no evidence that any assets acquired by the bank subsequent to that transfer were premeditated.  On the other side, the authority also noted that communication with customers during that transfer process could have been better, that there was a focus on pricing increases for risk at the expense of due consideration of long-term viability and that the decisions made relating to customers were not well documented or explained.  The final point made was that complaints were not well identified and handled by the bank.  As a result of that, RBS in the UK announced a new complaints process with independent oversight from a former UK High Court judge and an automatic refund of what I would describe as complex fees, which is the expression used.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, clearly, the review by the Financial Conduct Authority only covers the UK.  The Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran review, which was conducted on the original allocations, found no basis for those allegations and Ulster Bank has agreed.  The bank will seek to provide exactly the same treatment to any similarly affected customers who are identified and that process has started and is ongoing.  It will not be a very swift process but I do not think it will take an inordinate length of time to do.  We have kept our regulator informed of where we are in that process.  As soon as we have identified affected customers, we will be in contact with them.<\/p> <p>  I will make two further comments on this regarding the nature of Ulster Bank customers.  It is fair to say that customers that transferred to the global restructuring group to a greater extent in the Republic of Ireland were those with commercial real estate exposure versus more SME-orientated businesses in the UK.<\/p><p>The incidence of the payment of so-called complex fees is expected to have been relatively low, for no reason other than that most customers just were not in a position to meet ongoing commitments, never mind fees over and above those.<\/p><p> With regard to the question on the transfer out of the global restructuring group, relatively few of the customers transferred out of the group back into Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Blair","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I appreciate the background.

They give the impression that the various businesses concerned contacted Ulster Bank to ask for money to purchase a commercial property and the bank simply gave the money to them.  The businesses in question applied for a loan and the banks had a responsibility in that process to apply a stress test to the proposal.  Mr. Mallon placed responsibility fairly and squarely on the person who contacted the bank for a loan.  However, Ulster Bank gave the loan when it should have tested whether it was worthwhile to do so.  The bank has a responsibility in this process, including to the 2,141 customers involved, notwithstanding that it dumped 1,800 of them into vulture funds.  It is an incredible performance on the part the witnesses with respect to the questions asked by members.  It is shocking that they do not know off the top of their heads the exact numbers and the general positions regarding these companies.  The bank gave the same answer to Deputy Pearse Doherty on the 2,000 tracker cases it is examining.  There is an urgency to this for the mortgage holders and the 2,141 businesses involved, behind which there are families and individuals.  Mr. Mallon seems to have no care or respect for them, notwithstanding his words of comfort on how he is trying to rebuild the bank. <\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to provide the comprehensive information we are seeking as quickly as possible.

The standard metric measure being used at present is 3.5 times earnings.  I note Mr. Mallon's observations that this is not the most precise tool as an affordability measure and may not be the only metric to use in the longer term.  One of the issues that is coming to light in recent times is the phenomenon of people in their mid-30s who would have bought a property in the years 2004 to 2006, which is more than ten years ago and now find that the apartment, which is in negative equity, is too small to live in and they end up effectively renting out the apartment and renting a house for their family.  The mortgage for the apartment is covered by rental income and they are paying rent on a house, which is effectively a quasi mortgage.  In many cases they will not qualify for a mortgage and yet on an affordability basis they can qualify.  I believe they are caught in a trap of \"almost homelessness\", they are effectively paying prohibitive rents on their rental home and are in negative equity on their property.  They are utterly frustrated.  Has this informed Mr. Mallon's thinking?  I note he referred to the customers' other commitments, payment of rent while saving to purchase a property.  I think this will become more relevant as time goes on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#O00400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480584600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I was ultimately frustrated in that because of the bank's very loyal customer base and the phenomenal performance of the staff, primarily in branches, to help customers.  They went above and beyond the call of duty in helping customers.  It was primarily the efforts of the staff in the branches, on the front line, that allowed the bank to overcome that crisis.  RBS has put a very substantial investment into repairing the IT system and ensuring such a serious incident will not happen again.  The technology platform is in a very different position from where it was at the time of that incident.<\/p> <p>  The branch network is incredibly important to the bank.  It is one of the most important channels.  Our customers have told us they like talking to people.  They like the staff in Ulster Bank.  Ulster Bank has managed to differentiate itself from competitors in the market by providing superb customer service at the front line.  Having said that, customers are using the branches less and less and they are using them for different things.  They are telling us that it is important to interact with our staff when they have an important transaction to carry out, like securing a mortgage or personal loan or when there is some other change in their lives and they need help from the bank.  They are using the branches less and less for the more mundane transactions like paying bills or lodging cheques and so forth.  The branch network needs to reshape to be able to adjust to the fact that people are doing things in different ways.  In the future there will be fewer bank branches in the same way that there are now fewer travel agents and record shops.  Consumers have voted with their feet in that context.<\/p> <p>  As a consequence of that, I cannot give Senator Horkan a definite number.  The way in which the technology has evolved makes it incredibly unpredictable.  There has been more change in the past five or six years than in the previous 50 or 60.  When I started working in the banking industry, there was a 1970s model of banking still in place.  Banks were still closing at 3.30 p.m. and not opening before 10 a.m.  It was all very manual and paper based, but that has changed completely in the time I have been working in the industry.  I cannot forecast how much more that will change over the course of the next few years.<\/p> <p>  All I can say is that we do two things.  The first is that we keep everything under review in order that we ensure we are giving customers what they need.  Second, we take extreme cognisance of the position of customers or particular cohorts of customers.  We take cognisance of rural customers and the impact of any proposed changes on them.  We also take cognisance of elderly or other vulnerable customers and try our very best to ensure that where we cannot keep unsustainable branches open, we at least protect them or mitigate the effects in every possible circumstance.<\/p><p>We cannot do that in the long term, but we will consider where to protect and mitigate in every circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#Q02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I saw a reference.

The Vintners Federation of Ireland represent publicans in the 25 counties outside of Dublin.  We currently have a membership of 4,000.  The vast majority of these 4,000 outlets are family owned, family run, small businesses.  Pubs must renew their licence each year and the fee payable is based on six different licence bands.  Revenue issue figures showing the number of pubs in each band and they are as follows.  A total of 53% of pubs with a turnover of under &euro;190,500 per annum are in that licence band.  Some 24% of pubs are in the licence band of &euro;190,500 to &euro;380,999.  This is 77% of all pubs in the State have a turnover from alcohol of less than &euro;4,000 per week.  In the remaining four licence bands of &euro;381,000 to &euro;635,000 there are 10% of pubs, the &euro;635,000 to &euro;952,499 turnover band has 6%, the &euro;952,500 to &euro;1.27 million turnover band has 3% and there is a modest 4% of pubs that turn over more than &euro;1.27 million.  These figures show a vast accumulation of very small businesses where the control of every element of cost becomes critical.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade alcohol sales in pubs has fallen by a third for a myriad of reasons that are not necessary to be recounted here.  This reduction in sales has resulted in the above set of statistics.  Notwithstanding these figures, pubs are still a major source of employment right across the country with in excess of 50,000 people currently in gainful employment in the sector.  Over the past 12 to 18 months we have been increasingly exercised by calls from members in relation to significant increases in insurance.  With that in mind we conducted a wide-spread survey of members in September of this year and the findings are quite instructive.  A total of 88.3% of our members have seen an increase in insurance in the past two years with 38.5% of members seeing an increase of between 10% and 20% in the last 12 months.  Increases of between 20% and 40% were seen by 39.5% of our members in the last 12 months and 12% have seen increases in excess of 40%.  More frighteningly, 37% of members have indicated that they have experienced significant problems in insuring their business.<\/p> <p>  Like all businesses publicans have many costs to contend with and we asked our members to rank the costs that currently cause them most concern.  The top three in order of concern were: business insurance, commercial rates and TV subscriptions.   The third concern may surprise people who do not understand what happens in pubs but TV subscriptions can cost up to &euro;1,000 per month.  Clearly, business insurance is a cause of major concern within the trade and we have quite a bit of anecdotal evidence of some members experiencing extreme difficulty in getting adequate cover and some of these in situations where there would appear to be no enhanced risk from previous years.  Over the past number of years we have seen a number of insurance companies declining to even look at or quote for business in the sector.<\/p> <p>  We can speculate forever as to the reasons for the current high cost of insurance and until there is more transparency within the sector it will remain mere speculation.  We do know, however, that in Ireland the cost of settling claims is significantly higher than in most other European countries.  We know that legal costs play a very big part in the total cost of a claim and we know that the collapse of various insurance companies has led to various increases in premium.<\/p> <p>  So what needs to be done?  While the Vintners Federation of Ireland does not believe that it has the silver bullet solution, we believe addressing the following measures would go a long way towards bringing a level of sense back into the cost of insurance for businesses.  Enhanced powers could be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to determine liability on all public liability claims with very limited exceptions.  In particular, all detail upon which a claim is based must be produced at the PIAB stage.  An appeal from the PIAB stage should be such that it is only on a point of law.  There should be no legal fees for either side at PIAB.  There should be a review of the Book of Quantum with a view to bringing it into line with European norms.  We know there are a significant number of fraudulent claims and there should be enhanced penalties for people found guilty of bringing fraudulent claims.  Any alleged incident or accident must be reported to the company where it is alleged to have happened within 30 days of its occurrence.  If the current position is allowed to prevail more businesses will close simply because they cannot access insurance or cannot afford it.  There is still a window of opportunity to bring meaningful reforms that will allow businesses to survive and to continue to give employment but that window of opportunity is fast closing.  Action is urgently required.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity and we are prepared to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cribben.

The Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, is the representative organisation for the publicans of Dublin.  We have some 600 members which is over 80% of the pubs in our capital city.  Collectively our members sell 30% of the alcohol in the Irish on-trade and employ 12,000 staff.<\/p> <p>  In simple terms there are three elements involved in business insurance; property cover, employer&rsquo;s liability and public liability.  The LVA&rsquo;s concerns are entirely focused on the issue of public liability covering the premiums and the cost of claims, as we understand that such claims account for 89% of all liability claims in the licensed trade.  To provide the committee with some flavour on the nature of public liability claims in our sector our analysis shows that some 71% of these claims are related to slips, trips and falls.<\/p> <p>  The LVA surveyed its members in September on their experience of the cost of insurance renewal over the past three years, 2014 to date.  The figures are stark.  Average premiums paid in 2014 were more than &euro;16,670 per annum, rising to &euro;20,463 per annum in 2015 and rising again to almost &euro;25,000 per annum in 2016.  This is an average annual increase of 21% and 22% in the previous two years.  These figures disguise the huge range in premiums paid by pubs across Dublin with many of our suburban members paying &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 annually, which is a very high figure and increasing and increasing by 20% annually.  That late bar scene, however, faces enormous insurance bills, with many of these businesses facing annual premiums in the &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 range.  One of our members reported an insurance premium of &euro;145,000, up from &euro;80,000 two years previously.  It is clear that insurance premiums are a very significant cost for the Dublin licensed trade and that premiums are escalating at an unsustainable pace.  It is hampering the competitiveness of our industry and is threatening the viability of some pubs.  We have had the shocking case with one of our members where a customer was awarded &euro;90,000 for a dislocated thumb as a result of a fall on stairs.  The impact of this claim was that the insurance premium doubled to &euro;150,000 per annum, which is not sustainable or viable.  The nightclub part of his business had to be closed with the loss of 15 full-time jobs.<\/p> <p>  The Dublin licensed trade has a particular concern with claimants having up to two years to lodge a claim.  This is completely excessive as it makes it difficult for the business to prepare a defence as staff and\/or customer witness statements cannot be obtained at that stage and CCTV footage would no longer be available.<\/p><p> On the availability of statistics, we understand around 20% of claims are settled by the PIAB and that a further 5% to 10% actually end up in court.  This means that 70% to 75% of claims are settled directly between insurers and claimants.  There is absolutely no information available on the majority of public liability claim settlements.  This is simply unacceptable in a modern economy and a real deterrent for new entrants to the insurance market.  The Government needs to conduct an independent economic analysis of the cost drivers of escalating public liability insurance premiums to bring greater transparency to the opaque insurance market and allow both regulators and the public to understand the factors and the extent to which they contribute to higher premiums.  It is not possible to regulate for a better functioning insurance market without understanding and quantifying the cost drivers.  For example, we note from the PIAB that the trends in the past three years, from 2013 to 2015, show a 6% increase in the number of public liability insurance claims to 8,906, with the average award being very stable at approximately &euro;25,000.   These figures do not support the view that higher claim costs are causing the hikes in premiums.  Others point to legal costs as being a factor, but there is no such statistical evidence available.  Absolute clarity on the cost drivers is, therefore, needed.  The Government needs to legislate for the mandatory provision of statistical information on public liability insurance claims, to include the number of injury claims; the nature of these claims; the settlements paid; the legal, medical and other fees identified; and the duration from claim lodgment to settlement.  There should be a publicly available national claims register to provide for transparency on awards, costs and claimant details to minimise the risk of repeated claims by individuals.  <\/p><p> The Government should review the functioning of the PIAB to ensure that at least 75% of public liability insurance claims are settled by it without legal representation and oblige all claimants to notify the business concerned with full details of their claims with 30 days of an incident occurring.  It should also review the book of quantum which include all settled claims data, not just PIAB awards, and benchmark awards intentionally to ensure competitiveness from a business perspective.  It should also ensure the Judiciary consistently applies the book of quantum guidelines.  <\/p><p> We welcome the committee's focus on this important issue and are available to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>The delegates' recommendations for oversight of the insurance industry run along the same lines as those made in our report on the motor insurance industry, bar one, the recommendation relating to the PIAB and legal costs.

The insurance companies' perspective is that claims are always considered on case by case basis.  They are very concerned that the outcome of a court case is uncertain.  Average wards can be extraordinarily high.  They take the view, rightly or wrongly, that it is better to settle and have a defined outcome with which they can rather than take the risk of going to court.  Our concerns are the same as those expressed by Mr. Cribben and the Brokers Federation of Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Let me make a couple of other points.  There are significant costs involved in preparing a defence, including the time of the owner and management, in seeking legal advice, preparing the file, talking to staff and taking witness statements, all of which can be for naught.  Usually, when a publican goes to that much trouble, it is because he or she genuinely believes he or she has a defendable case, only to discover, typically within the week of the court hearing after the case has rumbled on for two years, that it has been settled without discussion with him or her and his or her views being taken into account.

It was the first meeting we had when we started to explore the insurance issue in late August or early September.  The insurance industry is inclined to point to the legal expenses and the level of the awards as the core problems while the legal people point to the insurance industry, the lack of competition and escalating premiums as the core problems.  Everybody is alluding to false and exaggerated claims as issues.  Specifically in the context of the insurance industry, there is no doubt that solvency, low interest rates and low market returns are affecting its finances but this element is not core to the business of insurance, as in managing premiums and dealing with claims.<\/p> <p>  Our first request to this committee and the Government is that there be an economic analysis to quantify exactly which factors are driving the premium rises.  Is it awards?  This does not seem to be the case.  Is it the number of awards, as in an escalating claims culture?  We do not believe so.  Is it the legal costs?  We have no clarity on it.  Is it exaggerated, false or bumped-up claims?  Nobody seems to have information on that or, at least, there is none that we can lay our hands on.  The lack of clarity or opaqueness that is applying in the market is a fundamental problem.  Certainly, no insurance company from outside the country will look into a market in which one cannot figure out the dynamics and invest heavily.  There is a very big demand regarding solvency capital requirements.  The companies will not take a risk in this regard when they cannot understand the dynamics.  An economic study, independent of the industry, is required to quantify the drivers of costs is the single most urgent step that needs to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016120100002#V00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1480584600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I have to attend a vote in the D&aacute;il.

I know a publican whose insurance cost annually was in the region of &euro;27,000 but in the past 12 months, that figure has increased to &euro;67,000.  That is an enormous increase.

Taking a midway point of approximately &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000, every increase of &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 in cost is a nail in the coffin.  In terms of somebody whose insurance premium increases from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000, when other things are taken into account that extra &euro;2,000 is a cause for extreme concern, particularly when businesses have such a low turnover.  That is a turnover level and when that is brought back to gross profit and one starts looking at the cost base and other costs that have been increasing, a 25% increase on an &euro;8,000 insurance bill will bring that up to &euro;10,000.

Because of the pressure that guys are under - not just pubs, but all small businesses - if somebody comes into the market with insurance they do not look to see if these guys are triple-A, double-A or A-rated.  In the last six weeks we have seen an insurer who came into the market and has been here for some time, which was regulated in Lichtenstein.  It has gone belly-up, as they say.  There were one or two brokers around the country using this particular underwriter.  Whatever premium they have paid they have no cover for that period.  There is a downside, therefore, in that unless we tightly regulate who is insuring them in the country, people under pressure will go to, let us call it, the lowest common denominator that will give them insurance.

We have travelled here as a collaboration of a number of councils, including Monaghan County Council, Donegal County Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council, as well as Fermanagh, Omagh, and the Mid-Ulster councils.  Those councils represent 500,000 to 750,000 people so it is a significant cohort and critical mass in an area with much potential that has yet to be realised.<\/p> <p>  Councils both North and South are currently enjoying the first opportunities to work under extended powers and remits.  Both sets of councils have worked together in recent months and years on responding to the development needs of our areas, including environmental, physical, structural and community planning.  In so doing, we have formed views on the potential that exists within our regions.  At the same time, we have got a first-hand understanding of the critical nature of access to our region.  In that context, some progress has been made generally both in community and economic development across our region in the past ten years.  However, we feel that much potential remains to be achieved under those headings.  <\/p> <p>  One of the most critical deficits at the moment relates to the need to have a safe route into the north-west from the east with certainty of travel times.  We need to dispel the notion of the north-west being distant or reached with some uncertainty.  Part of that notion has already been dispelled but more work remains to be done.  Over the past 20 years, there have been significant achievements on other fronts, but we want to build on them.  There has been a considerable easing of cross-Border barriers and communities are now working collaboratively.  In particular, councils North and South are working together on community planning.  The most recent reform of local government has enabled us to plan for our communities collectively in a way that we have not done before.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate the overall commitment to the route.  We are talking about a cost of &euro;870 million to bring the stretch from the city of Derry through to Ballygawley.  We appreciate the commitment from the Irish Government in contributing the sum of &euro;75 million towards that.  The difficulty concerns timelines.  We are looking at the first phase being to Strabane, then Omagh to Ballygawley, and the last phase from Strabane to Omagh.  That will impact on other plans by Donegal County Council, including links from Letterkenny to Strabane that would tie in with the A5.  For some years we have had approval - previously from the National Roads Authority, NRA, and now Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII - for compulsory purchase for a new bridge at Strabane.  In addition, there is a commitment that funding will become available for that.  Our difficulty, however, is that what we had planned to tie in with on the Northern side does not exist at present.  Being the last phase, it automatically sets back the new crossing from Lifford to Strabane quite a bit.<\/p> <p>  One of the fundamental changes in our approach in recent years is the fact that we fully understand that there is significant unrealised potential all along the route, but particularly in the north-west.  Currently, there is a net cost to both governments for running public services in the north-west region.  We feel there is a potential to expand our economic base and the role of our territories, whether in tourism or foreign direct investment, to a point where economic activity will be strengthened.  In that way, the balance would turn from being a cost to a net contributor.  The economic argument for this is much stronger now than in the past.  It comes on the back of a lot of collaborative work to ensure that other things are in place to sustain necessary employment and economic growth.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. John Kelpie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Neely"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and other members for having us here today.  I am the chief executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council.  As Mr. Neely said, we are here as a collective group.  Derry is very much the major urban centre at the core of that region.  Derry is the fourth largest city region on the island of Ireland, with a catchment population for a travel-to-work area of approximately 400,000.  It is the only city region on these islands that straddles an international border.  In fact, it is the only city region in the whole of Europe that straddles a border of that nature.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, there has been fantastic progress in the north-west.  Some recent economic announcements have been pleasing in terms of new job creation opportunities.  In addition, there have been physical and environmental improvements in our natural and built heritage.  There has been an expansion in our third-level colleges.  We have a high percentage of young people in the council's area, of which a large number attend third and higher-level educational colleges.  Over the past five to ten years, therefore, there has been much of positive progress.  That said, the fundamental challenges of the region stubbornly remain and have been hard to shift.  There has been a significant period of under-investment which is a legacy.  Our connectivity issues remain extremely challenging, including the issue of peripherality.  All of that has led to high levels of social deprivation and continued, stubbornly high unemployment rates.<\/p> <p>  There are many challenges but, as Mr. Neely said, there is a new era of opportunity.  On both sides of the Border, we have undergone local government reform.  This provides councils with welcome new powers to drive forward their regions and economies.  The north-west region has seen a specific focus through the North-South Ministerial Council, this joint committee and the North-West Gateway Initiative.  The new strategic north-west partnership, involving councils and both Governments, is a unique model of cross-jurisdictional local and central government collaboration on the island.<\/p><p>There is indeed a window of opportunity to transform the region and change those hard-to-shift statistics into what we aspire to, which is that the fourth-largest city region reaches its full potential in the same manner as Dublin, Belfast and Cork and eventually begins to become a net contributor to the economy on both sides of the island.<\/p><p> As councils, we have set off on a highly ambitious plan, and colleague councils around the table have similar strategic plans.  In the city of Derry, that will involve an expansion of the university and a significant focus on the growing of skills and the attraction of new FDI, the building of our SME base and capitalising on our greatest asset, namely, our talent and young people.  We in Derry city have developed a strategic plan to develop that area.  The outcome of that plan will see significant job growth, approximately &pound;500 million added to the GVA of Northern Ireland and an additional tax take of &pound;100 million per annum for the economy. <\/p><p> The unemployment rate will fall to below the Northern Ireland average for the first time in history.  These plans are predicated on increased and improved connectivity, in particular from the point of view of this committee, to Dublin Port, the city of Dublin as a centre of economic activity and, very importantly for us, to Dublin Airport.  Most of our FDI companies have North American bases and cite connectivity to Dublin Airport as one of the primary issues that concerns them in respect of where they locate on the island.<\/p><p> Our plan has been carefully worked through over the past number of months.  Consultation has taken place across our communities.  All of our statutory agencies, the Government and statutory partners have bought into the process.  We were very clear about our ambition for the future, but that ambition hinges on connectivity to the city of Dublin, its ports and airports.  We require rapid and reliable safe conductivity, and some of my colleagues will discuss those important issues.<\/p><p> To sum up, it is a key economic driver for us and a paramount and priority project, and we call on the committee to support us in terms of ensuring that those sections of the A5 that have been designed rapidly start on site and those sections of the N2 that remain to be designed and scoped as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I apologise to Mr. Slowey, cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council.

Mr. Neely used the phrase \"the deficit in infrastructure\" and Mr. Kelpie spoke about the unrealised potential and the new era of opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In the Border context, we also have to consider that a new era of challenges faces us due to political decisions made outside of our jurisdiction.  It was never more necessary for us, in particular those of us living in the province of Ulster and along the Border, to get our infrastructure up to standard.  We will face major challenges and will have no potential to meet them unless we have modern infrastructure.  Connectivity is obviously key to any region.<\/p> <p>  Some years ago, the same councils, at cathaoirleach and chief executive level, made very good presentations to this committee.  At one of the first meetings of the committee when the D&aacute;il returned earlier in the year, I proposed to the Chairman that we invite the group to come before the committee to discuss this key piece of infrastructure, and I am very glad that the Chairman facilitated that request.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Sullivan, our chief executive in Monaghan, spoke about the frustration that the cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Mr. O'Hanlon, I and other public representatives have endured over the past number of years in that a very small amount of money is required to finalise the preferred route.  Subsequent to bringing the representatives of the councils before the previous committee, representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority came before the committee.  We want to see the larger project proceed as rapidly as possible, but Clontibret to the Border is a key enabling piece of infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  That Monaghan County Council and the local population do not know what the preferred route will be is unfair. A small amount of money is required to tie down the specific corridor.  I wholly endorse the remarks of Mr. O'Sullivan, the chief executive of the council, in that respect.  Mr. O'Hanlon has spoken at length about the project at local level.  I appeal to TII and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to allocate the required funding. Our colleague, Senator Robbie Gallagher, has also raised this matter in the Seanad and has the full support of all political opinion in County Monaghan.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelpie spoke about advances in the development of higher education through the institutes of technology in Letterkenny and Sligo, which serves part of the area, and the higher institutes and university in Derry.  We know from visits made by the previous committee to Derry, Letterkenny and the general area that there has been a great era of co-operation between North and South.  Other colleagues have heard me say on numerous occasions, in particular in the context of Brexit and the challenges we face, that as a country we have underestimated the great growth in commerce and business on a North-South and South-North basis.<\/p> <p>  Business, commerce and people move seamlessly today, and it is to be hoped they will continue to do so in this the future.  We need to capitalise on the opportunities available to us.  We need to deal with the deficits in our infrastructure which were highlighted in the presentation and the contributions of witnesses.  I wholly endorse every sentiment that has been expressed by the witnesses.

The North-West Gateway Initiative is great but it needs infrastructure.  I live in Boyle, which is on the N4.  When we look at a map of the island of Ireland, the M6 goes to Galway and the M1 goes to Dublin but the entire region, North and South, is devoid of motorways and dual carriageways.  It needs this initiative.  To be a little parochial, going from Sligo to Belfast, which is not that far, we have the N16 to the Border and then the A5.  Some work has been done on it and &euro;3 million was spent.  There are 30 km in Leitrim and 7 km in Cavan to Belcoo but there seems to be nothing on the A5 between Belcoo and Enniskillen.  If we are talking about cross-Border from the west of Ireland, this should be included.  I am not taking away from the argument, but we need to do much more on these routes because they have been neglected.  Deputy Smith rightly said Sligo has an institute of technology.

In response to the comment on what specifically can be done, in very broad terms my understanding is that the northern part of the road, the A5, is in four phases.  Phase 1 is fully funded and goes from south of Derry to north of Strabane.  It is undergoing due process.  Phase 2, going from Omagh to Ballygawley, and phase 3, going from Strabane to Omagh, are going through the design process.  What will hold these two back is money.  Money is not allocated to take either of these phases onto site when they are ready, and they will be ready design-wise and process-wise relatively quickly.  Phase 4 goes from Ballygawley to the Border at Aughnacloy and is being held up because, as my colleague, Mr. O'Sullivan, might advise, the route scoping has not yet been done on the southern side of the Border.  Even finalising the design for this phase on the Northern side requires the southern side scoping to take place and, of course, money to deliver it.  In summary, phase 1 of the A5 should proceed quite quickly, which is the smallest length from Derry to Strabane.  This would be very welcome.  The remaining phases are developing through the design and legal processes but the big impediment is money to deliver them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Is there money for phase 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Yes, as I understand it phase 1 is fully funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":587,"content":"<p>What is holding it is up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":588,"content":"<p>It is going through the final phase of the legal process to ensure it clears those hurdles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":589,"content":"<p>So there is nothing much we can do on this phase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":590,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelpie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

I live in the Border county of Louth, as does the Chairman, and we have seen the huge benefit of proper interconnectivity in the road network and the huge plus it has been, particularly for the cities of Dundalk and Newry, and how important the bond has been.  Connectivity between Donegal and Derry is hugely important to the region.  I am fully supportive of what is being done.  We are very happy to work with our Ministers in Government if there is any pressure we can put on any of the agencies.  We have had much discussion, and if the witnesses wish they can follow up if they identify three or four things we must do.  I assure them that from my perspective it will be done.<\/p> <p>  We are entering into a period of uncertainty given Brexit, and there may not be European funding in the Northern part of the country, which there is at present.

That has made progress over the past six months or so.  Given the age of the existing design work on the route, it needs to be revisited.  As environmental regulations are more stringent now than when the original piece of work was done, a consultant has been appointed recently, funded from TII, to re-examine the route in its entirety from Strabane to Letterkenny, including the relief bridge in Letterkenny and how the crossover piece linking the city of Derry towards Stranorlar and Donegal town.  That is progressing at as fast a pace as it can and the work necessary to see that piece closed out, which will bring it to preferred route stage, should take about two years.

In the period 2017 to 2019, the statutory processes and final route selection for the Clontibret to the Border phase could be completed.  Our latest estimate indicates that Monaghan County Council would require &euro;1.6 million as project lead on behalf of TII to fast-track this process and get it down to preferred route selection, narrowing it from a current corridor of 400 m to approximately 50 m to 100 m.  It would bring certainty.  Obviously, within the same period, we would dovetail with our colleagues on the northern side of the Border to ensure that the Ballygawly-Aughnacloy piece, which is essential, could also go through the same procedure.  They are vital.  The only obstacle to doing that is a financial allocation because we are quite prepared.  As I mentioned earlier, I have staff.  My road design team is ready, willing and able to take that on.  It has readily been identified by my council and councillors as a key priority not just for County Monaghan but for the region.  It is a strategic piece of infrastructure that is urgently needed.  It is already long overdue, to be honest, and, in light of the changes this year, it has become even more essential to deliver it for the region.  As to local government changes from 2014 on the northern side of the Border, we are now developing the links in relation to cross-Border co-operation.

I and Mr. Liam Hannaway will make a joint presentation.  Members will already have a copy of our opening statement.  To put it in context, our two councils have a long history of cross-Border co-operation dating back to 1976 when we both were founding members of the east Border region committee.  In 1976, despite a history of back-to-back development and a very challenging political climate, which was not conducive to the notion of cross-Border co-operation, both councils realised the mutual benefit which could be gained through working in partnership.  The introduction in later years of the EU-funded INTERREG programme and subsequent programmes during this time enabled both councils to collaborate on a whole series of projects which have enhanced the cross-Border region.  Early projects in 1970s included the production of tourism promotional material such as The Land of Cchulainn and St. Patrick and building on our shared heritage and history.  Other projects supporting crafts and small business were undertaken with the assistance of the early INTERREG programmes.<br\/><br\/>As trust and mutual respect developed between both councils, further co-operation projects were supported such as the Newry-Dundalk twinning committee, the Newry-Dundalk linkages programme, Newry-Dundalk mini-metropolis, and most notably, the signing of a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between both councils in 2011.  This MOU was launched in the Northern Ireland Executive office in Brussels and was hailed by the then head of INTERREG, Colin Woolfe, as the &quot;first of its kind&quot; in Europe.  This confirmed the high level of cross-Border co-operation which had developed within our region.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to the Narrow Water Bridge project specifically, that concept can also be traced back to the 1970s.  An extract from <i>The<\/i><i>Newry Reporter <\/i>in January of 1976 reads: &quot;Councillors from both sides of the border met in Newry ... and gave their backing to a proposal to build a bridge linking Omeath and Warrenpoint&quot;.  For those who may not be familiar with this project, the picture in our presentation shows Carlingford Lough looking towards the sea and members can see the small bridge where the there is a spit of land at the narrowest point.  That picture shows a virtual bridge, as it is not built yet.  Since 1976, the Narrow Water Bridge project has been a strategic objective of both councils but, throughout the years the significant costs associated with the scheme have made the realisation of the project prohibitive.  From 2010 Louth County Council progressed the scheme, with some funding from central government from the Department of Transport, and by 2013 most of the preliminary work, including design, planning permissions, vesting orders and so on had been completed but the capital element eluded us.<br\/><br\/>In 2013, the INTERREG IVA programme represented the first real opportunity to source significant funding for the capital element of the Narrow Water Bridge project.  A funding application prepared by Louth County Council and Newry and Mourne District Council in conjunction with the east Border region was successful and &euro;17.4 million was secured.  Unfortunately, the actual capital cost was significantly higher than the grant available.  As I recall, it was around &euro;34 million.  Despite concerted and considerable efforts by all involved, we were unable to realise the shortfall and had to relinquish the INTERREG moneys in 2014 as otherwise they would have been lost to Ireland and to Northern Ireland.  This was extremely disappointing, not only for both councils but for the people of the region who had been very vociferous in their support for this strategic project.  The project remains a strategic priority for both councils.  For example, it is included in Louth County Council's county development plan as a strategic project, but in the absence of outside funding, the capital element cannot be progressed.  Since that time in 2014, both councils have continued to lobby both Governments to support the scheme.  Mr. Liam Hannaway might deal with some of the more recent developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Martin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I will pick up from the publication of the Fresh Start agreement.

A report was presented to the North-South Ministerial Council on Friday, 18 November 2016, at which point it was agreed to continue further developments.<br\/><br\/>Since then, there have also been discussions regarding the southern relief road.  At the time, the roads service division of Transport Northern Ireland, Transport NI, included the Newry southern relief road as part of its strategic programme of work.  It began to devise options, some of which included the Narrow Water bridge scheme.  The current Banbridge, Newry and Mourne area plan includes a proposal for a Newry southern bypass as a long-term strategic road improvement to link from the A1 Dublin Road, a key strategic route, to the A2 Warrenpoint Road, a trunk road leading to Warrenpoint Port.  Transport NI&rsquo;s consultation document on proposals to expand the regional strategic transport network transport plan for 2015 includes the Newry southern relief road as a scheme that performed well in assessment but that was not affordable within ISNI funding envisaged to 2015.<br\/><br\/>Representations made by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade resulted in the department&rsquo;s agreement to undertake a local transport study of the southern side of Newry to assess the impact of the suggested southern relief road, the possible lines of a new link from the A2 Warrenpoint Road to the A1 Dublin Road at or in the vicinity of Cloghogue roundabout and also what alternative options are available to provide relief to traffic in the area.<br\/><br\/>The Newry southern relief road proposal has been progressed into Transport NI&rsquo;s forward planning schedule.  Transport NI has appointed AECOM as consultants and work has commenced on the stage 1 preliminary options scheme assessment.  This work will involve updating key project information and will require traffic and environmental surveys to be undertaken.  AECOM have identified five options for consideration, two of the options are located in close proximity to the site of the Narrow Water bridge proposal and involve the construction of a vehicular bridge across the Clanrye River.  I will hand over to Ms Martin to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hannaway","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":604,"content":"<p>From a council point of view, clearly no current funding options such as INTERREG moneys are available to allow us to progress the Narrow Water bridge project as envisaged.

I have always supported the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge and I was bitterly disappointed in 2014 when the concept did not quite meet the financial requirements.  What indications do the witnesses have that the necessary finance will ever appear again?  There was much emotional and practical support behind the project at the time, which pushed it on even though there was some resistance to it.  What hope do we have that the money could be forthcoming at a later date?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hannaway mentioned five options.  Two of them are close to Warrenpoint, but what are the other three options?  Leading on from that, is there a combined option between some sort of a Narrow Water bridge and Newry bypass option in some shape?  In other words, will the bridge be strong enough to take some of the port traffic coming out of Warrenpoint and to put it over on to the Omeath side?  How far upstream could the bridge be moved before it is out of County Louth?  Is it 1 km or 2 km?<\/p> <p>  I fully support the concept but I am echoing some of the criticism that has been thrown at me at times about it.  Where would the bridge lead to on the southern side?  Would there be a run-off road?  How would one travel from Warrenpoint to Omeath?  Would it be a question of going around the Cooley Peninsula or back up into Newry on the southern side of the lough?  There are a number of questions there, probably too many.  The concept is very good and I fully support it.  However, I am just worried, in the same way as the Vice Chairman outlined, about what we can do.  To some extent what prompted my question on at what point does the bridge move out of Louth is based on the fact that it would then become a totally Northern operation.  If the bridge were between Down and Armagh it is a northern operation rather than a Louth operation.  Perhaps the witnesses could respond to some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I thank the speakers for their presentation.

The latter has existed since the mid-1970s.  It was always about creating the loop where people could drive to the Cooley peninsula, to Rostrevor and around to Newcastle.  The aim of the project was to encourage people to disperse around the area and thus spread tourism.  The purpose of the southern relief road is to get traffic from Warrenpoint port as quickly and as painlessly as possible and on to the Dublin-Belfast road without going near Newry.  The road needs to get over the mountain and on to the North-South motorway so serves a different purpose.  If the southern relief road goes ahead, and depending on where its bridge is built, then it may not make sense to build another bridge.<\/p> <p>  County Louth received money for a greenway along Carlingford Lough that spanned Carlingford to Omeath.  We have now received a letter of offer to extend the greenway further under the INTERREG V programme.  This year the greenway has attracted enormous numbers of between 50,000 and 80,000 visitors.  Cyclists will be able to travel from Carlingford to Lough Neagh on the current greenway, the extension and a towpath along the canal north from Newry.  The project attracts many tourists.  In many ways the time is more right than ever for a project to support tourism in the area, particularly one that will encourage tourists to travel around the area of Cooley and Mourne mountains.<\/p> <p>  Senator Black suggested a car ferry for the area and we have just talked about such a project.  There has been a ferry concept as far back as the 1970s and early 1980s.  Clearance has finally be given for a ferry from the mouth of the lough between Greenore port area over to Greencastle in County Down.  A ferry will add to the loop and infrastructure that is already available to tourists.  People will be able to take the ferry, travel around the Mourne mountains for the day and then return on the bridge.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about costs.  We have received tenders in excess of &euro;30 million.  We have had something of an argument with the consulting engineers because the original estimate was &euro;17.4 million, which was based on our grant application to INTERREG, and the tender is in excess of &euro;30 million.  The huge disparity in cost was explained by the uniqueness of the bridge.  Members will have seen the picture of the bridge included in our presentation.  The bridge is unique as it requires a lifting mechanism in order to continue to allow access to the important canal and basin in Newry that is being developed as a marina and tourism area.  Such an unusually designed lifting bridge would be a risk for a contractor and thus led to an increased cost.  <\/p> <p>  INTERREG IVA is the only programme that offered us an opportunity to apply for funding.  Normally there would not be an opportunity for a council to apply for large infrastructural grants in the roads area.  That money, on previous programmes, was kept within the Departments located in the North and South.  It is the first time in the 30 or 40 years of the project that we have had such an opportunity.  Unfortunately, today I must say to the committee that I do not know where the opportunity rests at the moment.  There is nowhere for the councils to apply for funding.  There is no opportunity with INTERREG V.  The PEACE programme does not have that kind of infrastructural money available to it either.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the South does not have an enormous budget.  It has suffered a lot of cutbacks and has not retrieved the level of budget that it had.  The Department has never been in a position to offer us large funding for the project although it gave us some assistance when developing the designs.  <\/p> <p>  The planning permissions for the bridge are in place.  Obviously the project straddles two jurisdictions so it has two sets of everything.  The compulsory purchase order in the Republic of Ireland does not have a lifespan and in theory lasts forever.  On the Northern side, the permissions are five years in duration.  We have moved rapidly through the allotted period as the project is fast approaching four years.    Time is running out for all of the permissions, designs and everything we have at the moment.  Therefore, we will have to go again and make the investment without some kind of security.  I feel we are looking for support.  The project is being seriously considered by the North-South Ministerial Council.  It has met us and continues to consider the project.  There may be some level of enthusiasm for the project at the moment and hard lobbying might unlock the money.  The Governments will have to make a move as there is nowhere else for us to go.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Hannaway will respond to the remaining questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Martin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I shall pick up on Dr. McDonnell's question on the five options for the southern relief road.

They are similar to the Narrow Water Bridge because bridges will have to open and deal with traffic.  The council is committed to the Narrow Water Bridge in terms of a tourism project and promoting tourism.<\/p> <p>  Ms Martin has talked about the car ferry option mentioned by Senator Black.  On my way here today I received a phonecall from the developer of the project.  He told me that he hopes to have the roadworks finished this side of Christmas and to start drive piling.  He also hopes to have the ferry operational in May and has commenced his marketing plan.  We are trying to complete the Northern side of the greenway with a view to starting on the second side that will join Newry with Carlingford.  Our project is creating a level of the loop.  <\/p> <p>  We are also, within the Newry, Mourne and Down development plan, considering greenways that will connect Newcastle.  We are considering ways to connect Strangford Lough with Carlingford Lough in the long-term.  We are building on the tourism potential for the south Down area.<\/p><p>The big issue for the southern relief road is that this time 12 months ago we had hoped to apply for status as a trans-European transport network, TEN-T, project.  The roads Minister, Mr. Christopher Hazzard, was in Brussels and got a good hearing regarding the southern relief road as part of the TEN-T process but Brexit throws everything into the air with regard to funding, particularly whether we can attract European funding.  The southern relief road is by no means a given either.  The Narrow Water bridge and this project are sitting precariously because of considerations of where we will get funding.  The Minister is committed to developing the environmental options and development proposals for the southern relief road.  That is moving ahead.  Ultimately, we need money to build the Narrow Water bridge and the southern relief road.  These are strategic projects for our area.<\/p><p> Those are the answers to the main questions.  There was a question about what can the committee do.  I go back to the Fresh Start agreement, which indicates the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government agree to undertake a review of the project and identify options for future development that can be considered by the North-South Ministerial Council.  We need it brought to a conclusion and whether both Governments will commit to develop the Narrow Water bridge.  We must know what the Governments will commit to and how it can be developed.  That is the answer we require.  The process began with the signing of the Fresh Start agreement and it has been discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council.  I know from November's meeting there is a commitment to meet stakeholders again in January.  We must bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible.  We urge this committee to work with us to bring that to a conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016120100002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hannaway","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480601700,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for a frank presentation.

I described the importance of the project as being tr&iacute;ocha c&uacute;ig bliain ag f&aacute;s but I am moving it now to daichead bliain ag f&aacute;s, or 40 years growing.  I am constrained today in what I would like to say as I am sitting as Vice Chairman.  There is much passion about this project and many people despair about how it might be brought forward because there have been so many stops and starts along the way.  The crossing of Narrow Water was described as being of strategic priority from an economic and, in particular, a tourism perspective.  The critical mass of the Down, Mourne, Cooley and Gullion region has been described passionately by me and I will continue to do that.  There are immense tourism opportunities and I have said it could be the Kerry of the North.  I will continue to say that.  I suppose the Troubles have not helped us in creating that tourism mass but it is very important that we welcome the participation and co-operation which is happening and which was outlined by the witnesses.  They described how two local authorities have faced each other for many years and particularly with regard to the memorandum of understanding.<\/p> <p>  I laud that work, particularly the role of East Border Region, in helping that process.  I also acknowledge the public representatives, both North and South, who have faced each other to try to deal with a myriad of issues.  We must seek a commitment - and not just a verbal commitment - to see this project through, either as a transport and infrastructure project or a tourism project.  Some crossing must be constructed across the lough in order to progress the aims and ambitions of everybody living in the region who wants, regardless of Brexit, to see the spirit of co-operation continue.

I appreciate this opportunity to meet members and I will make opening comments on the Supplementary Estimate being sought by my Department.  The committee will recall that in my presentation on 22 September I mentioned the possibility of additional capital moneys being provided to my Department in 2016.  Arising from the discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been able to secure the agreement for the provision of an additional &euro;35 million in capital moneys for my Department.  In addition, I have also secured agreement to redirect a further sum of &euro;25 million of existing departmental funding which will not be spent in 2016 as originally intended.  This means that the Department has an overall total package of &euro;60 million for further capital investment in 2016.  The proposed distribution of this &euro;60 million is an additional &euro;1 million to support local enterprise offices, LEOs, and &euro;10 million to Microfinance Ireland, MFI.  My colleague, Deputy Breen, will provide the committee with some detail as to how this additional money will be distributed between the LEOs and Microfinance Ireland, MFI.  The remaining &euro;49 million of the investment package will be directed at research and development supports, with significant additional capital funding to Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the programme for research in third level institutes, PRTLI, and Ireland's involvement in the European Space Agency's research and development programmes.  SFI will be provided with an additional &euro;27 million, thereby bringing its overall capital investment in 2016 to &euro;184 million.  This is the highest ever level of capital investment by the foundation in a single year.<\/p><p>This additional capital money will allow SFI to fund the acquisition of critically needed research equipment across each of the seven universities and also assist a number of other research bodies such as Teagasc, Waterford IT, Tyndall National Institute and the Royal College of Surgeons.  The acquisition of this vital equipment will directly support research in key strategic areas, such as medical devices, immunology, agrifood, drug delivery, etc.<\/p><p> Through the programme for research in third level institutions, the Supplementary Estimate will allow for an additional &euro;20 million to be provided to meet the State's commitments under the PRTLI programme.  The PRTLI operates in cycles of funding of typically five to six years.  The current cycle, cycle five, was initiated in 2011 and involved a total of &euro;350 million in awards to higher education institutes, spanning 33 distinct projects.  The State committed &euro;290 million with the remaining &euro;60 million coming from private moneys.  The provision of the additional &euro;20 million will now allow the State to accelerate the timescale from meeting its outstanding commitments under PRTLI cycle five.  This in turn will help in progressing the plans for launching cycle six, which are actively being worked on by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p><p> Finally, the remaining additional &euro;2 million provided for in the package will be invested in a number of specific European Space Agency programmes.  These investments will essentially help to meet liabilities in respect of contracts which are in the process of being placed with Irish companies.  My Department's investment in the ESA programmes will total more than &euro;19 million this year.  Ireland derives from it a number of concrete benefits for our economy, including a fourfold increase in commercial sales by Irish companies involved in the high-tech space sector, with sales amounting to &euro;75 million in 2015 and employment in ESA supported companies in Ireland increasing from 1,300 in 2008 to 2,000 in 2014.  Employment is expected to double to more than 5,000 by 2020.  It is fair to say that capital investment through the Department's innovation programme has played a significant part in ensuring that Ireland is recognised as a leading research performing nation.  This is borne out by a rapid ascent in the accepted international scientific rankings, where we are now ranked in the top ten of leading research performing nations in the world.  These additional innovation supports concretely demonstrate that Ireland is committed to punching above its weight as a research and development performing nation.  It also ensures that research and development can continue to be a significant element of Ireland's offering in terms of attracting mobile foreign direct investment.<\/p><p> With the Chairman's agreement, I now invite my colleague to provide the committee with some details of the LEO offices and Microfinance Ireland elements to the Supplementary Estimate package.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#A00600","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I, too, am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the details of the Department's 2016 Supplementary Estimate.  As advised by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, I propose to provide members of the committee with details of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the Microfinance Ireland elements of the Supplementary Estimate package, which are both supported under the jobs and enterprise development programme of the Department's Vote.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to provide the local enterprise offices with an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding in 2016, thereby bringing total capital investment in these offices to &euro;19.5 million by year end.  The additional capital investment will be directed at LEOs which have signalled that they have a pipeline of ready made projects for investment.  The 14 LEOs concerned anticipate that these projects will support the creation of more than 100 jobs across the regions.  Members of the committee will be well acquainted with the valuable work done by the local enterprise offices and the undertakings of their respective regions.  The LEOs job performance since their establishment in 2014 has been remarkable.  Their performance to date in 2016 indicates a continuation of this strong jobs creation momentum.  The initial capital allocation of &euro;18.5 million in 2016 allowed the LEOs to target and approve 900 projects for grant support with an associated full-time equivalent jobs total of 1,500 for the full year.  At the end of October, more than &euro;13 million had been approved in grant supports for 747 projects across the LEO network, with more than 1,400 jobs associated with these approvals.  The additional &euro;1 million in capital funding, being provided through the Supplementary Estimate package, will ensure that this impressive performance of job delivery across the regions can continue to be built on.<\/p> <p>  As regard Microfinance Ireland, the Supplementary Estimate package will allow for a further tranche of capital investment of &euro;10 million into the microenterprise loan fund, as was envisaged under the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012.  The MFI fund is an important point of access to finance for many microenterprises.  While it took some time to establish its brand, MFI has performed impressively well in the past 18 months to two years and so far it has helped to create or sustain 2,232 jobs across the regions.  The &euro;10 million being allocated through the Supplementary Estimate package is required now to support the ongoing work of the fund for a further five years.  A further tranche of investment will be supplemented by additional financial support from the three main banks to the tune of &euro;15 million in the next five years.  The additional capital will be used to grow the level of the fund and ensure that MFI supports as many microenterprises as possible in terms of meeting their credit needs.<\/p> <p>  I hope the foregoing is of assistance to the members of the committee in regard to the rationale underlying the distribution of the proposed Supplementary Estimate package, particularly in so far as the local enterprise offices and Microfinance Ireland programmes are concerned.  I have no doubt that the additional capital investment in these programmes will significantly enhance their capacity to continue the related important challenges of providing steady access to finance to our SME community and stimulating job creation across the regions.<\/p> <p>  I will be delighted to answer questions on those two areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#B00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, for his statement.

The LEOs that got the additional funding were Carlow, which got &euro;40,000; Cork city, which got &euro;50,000; Donegal, which got &euro;100,000; Dublin city, which got &euro;100,000; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which got &euro;60,000; Fingal, which got &euro;120,000; Kerry, which got &euro;20,000; Kildare, which got &euro;100,000; Limerick, the Deputy's county, which got &euro;50,000; Mayo, which got &euro;30,000; Sligo, &euro;85,000; Tipperary, which got &euro;170,000; Westmeath, which got &euro;75,000; and Wexford, which got &euro;69,500.  As I said, all those companies were ready with projects that would create jobs.  In total in 2015, LEOs created more than 3,533 jobs, and having that &euro;1 million now for those additional projects that are ready to run will create a further number of jobs.  We are very happy with the performance of the LEOs.  With the additional funding of &euro;4 million in 2017 we intend to make sure the LEOs grow further and create more jobs.  The recovery has to spread into all regions, which is the idea behind having a local enterprise office working in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and having finance, advice and other services available.  They are an area that is very important to every region and to every county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Collins's other question.  The Deputy asked whether Enterprise Ireland and the IDA would be disadvantaged by these savings and, especially in light of Brexit, they will not be disadvantaged.  The committee needs to appreciate the multi-annual nature of the enterprise and innovation grants provided through the Department.  Typically the grants of the enterprise agencies span three, five, seven and eight-year periods.  Our enterprise and innovation policies are about sustaining sustainable economic growth and societal development.  The consequences of securing Cabinet approval for this Supplementary Estimate, which, let us remind ourselves, includes an overall package of &euro;60 million in capital investment, means that the Department's total capital expenditure by year end will be &euro;548 million.  That is the largest ever productive capital investment made through the Department in a single year.  However, that &euro;548 million will be surpassed by a total capital spend next year of &euro;555 million, which I secured in budget 2017.  We expect to be before the committee again in February to talk to it about the 2017 Estimates.  We will elaborate further on the 2017 plans then.  In 2016 and 2017, the level of Exchequer capital funding through the likes of Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, SFI and the LEOs will be about &euro;1.1 billion, which will support Irish-based enterprise and innovation.  It will also be supplemented by a significant amount of agencies' own resource income, ORI.  Typically it is around &euro;100 million per annum.  The Exchequer capital and agency ORI combined means that, through the Department, the Government is investing in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the two years.  This is to ensure we can continue to support the jobs and innovation agendas proactively and be responsive to the various global issues like Brexit, the changing US administration and all that might arise from it.  We are pretty well resourced for this year and for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for coming in today.  I welcome some of the figures we have in front of us.  We can see the further investment transferring onto the ground, so to speak, with the number of job announcements that have been made over recent months, especially in my county of Limerick.  There have been quite a number of job announcements and I will continue to acknowledge and welcome that.  I also welcome the reduction in unemployment.  The figures are down to 7.2%, from approximately 15% five years ago, so we have halved it in five years.  I want to see that trend continue.  That needs to be stated from the outset.<\/p> <p>  On the further investment, particularly in IDA and Enterprise Ireland, the Minister mentioned figures of &euro;1.3 billion over the next two years.  Given what has happened in the United States, with the uncertainty for our own economy because of the number of American multinationals here, and as a result of Brexit, has there been a change in focus at departmental level to the Asian economies and to looking again at growing the footprint in Asia?  As Deputy Collins mentioned, we had the IDA in and we talked to its representatives about what footprint we had in Asia.  It is continuing to grow but there needs to be a new campaign or focus on Asia given the breadth of that market.<\/p> <p>  I will share some evidence with the committee.  After living on that side of the world, I know that many Asian people assume that Ireland is part of the UK.  They would not see Ireland as an independent country.  I do not want people in that jurisdiction and market to think we are leaving the EU, that is, even if they recognise that Ireland is there.  We need to get the message out there.  We are talking about 60% of the world's population.  Our footprint is quite low.  It is on the increase and I welcome that.  There should be an increased focus on that side of the world, given what has happened in the United States, Brexit and the change in the world order.  Is that becoming a major priority within the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Neville.  Limerick has had a huge number of jobs announced.  I am delighted that unemployment is going down and that 2 million people are back at work.  We cannot be complacent.  The Deputy's question is a valid one.  There is an Asia strategy being devised with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we are also feeding into that strategy.  The IDA is diversifying away from the US towards Asia and so is Enterprise Ireland.  The trade missions have been beefed up.  For example, I was on one just recently to Japan, China and Hong Kong, and the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, was in India recently.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, was also in China.  That is continuing to happen.  The information coming back from Asia, China and India is that the companies there are very interested in Ireland, they are very aware of Brexit, what is happening here and also what is happening with the US change of Government.  We will certainly be keeping a very close eye on that with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to make sure we diversify the markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned I was in India.  Enterprise Ireland is planning its trade missions for 2017.<\/p><p>Asia will be a central focus for those trade missions.  As the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has said, I led a trade mission of 14 Irish companies to India in the past ten days.  We were focused on the area of aviation, which might be of interest to Deputy Neville since he is from Limerick.  India is a big country with a population of 1.3 billion people and those responsible there are looking at connecting the smaller towns with regional routes using smaller aircraft.  This is where Ireland can help because Ireland leases half the aircraft in the world to airline companies.  I had the pleasure of opening an aviation show there as well and we met the Indian Minister of Civil Aviation.<\/p><p> Another area we concentrated on was information and communications technology.  The Irish companies were looking for business there but we also visited the key Indian companies that have a footprint in Ireland.  Wipro is based in Dublin and Shannon and Techtronics is in Dublin and Waterford.  We met the key executives in those companies.  They are in the mode of expanding worldwide at the moment.  We made a pitch through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that Ireland would be considered in that context.  <\/p><p>The good news from those companies is that they are very happy with our workforce and with our costs as well.<\/p><p> These trade missions are worthwhile.  The President, Mr. Higgins, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, were in Laos and Vietnam recently.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, made a successful visit to China and Japan.<\/p><p> We also could have a greater diplomatic presence in those areas as well.  I hope that when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reviews its footprint in Asia, it will consider opening more consulate offices, especially in India.  That is one point I will be discussing with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  We do not have a presence in Mumbai at the moment.  Since it is the most commercial city in India, I hope that we can put in place a consulate office there.  Having a permanent presence and working in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland is vital.  In that way we can attract more industry to Ireland.  We are the fastest-growing economy in Europe and India is the fastest-growing economy in the world.  We are looking forward and hoping that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will continue these trade missions in view of Brexit.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is a question of diversifying into other regions while ensuring that we continue our presence in Europe, the UK and America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#C00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Subhead B4 relates to the science and technology development programme and there is an increase of &euro;27 million.

IBEC facilitated a meeting between the president of Waterford Institute of Technology, Professor Willie Donnelly, and the president of Carlow Institute of Technology in an effort to further the technological university.

Sometimes people come to me when they are trying to start up or expand a business.  Many of them are not aware of the good work, help and support they can get from local enterprise offices.  Perhaps this is something the committee might examine next year.  We could do some advertising to spell it out for people.  A lady came to me recently.  She has run a successful play-school for over 20 years and was hoping to expand.  She had never heard of local enterprise offices.  This was the first time in her life that she was thinking of expanding and she was wondering where she should go.  I directed her to the Waterford local enterprise office and it has worked out well for her.  Anyway, my point is that until I steered her in that direction, she was unsure where to go.  I acknowledge she had never thought about making a move previously but some people have told me they never realised the help they could get in the local enterprise offices.  They are working well.  They offer a one-stop-shop service.  I congratulate the Minister on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016120100002#D00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1480600800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I will answer the question about INTERREG and the figure of &euro;2.77 million first.  It was not possible to spend any of this allocation in 2016 due to certain circumstances.  The circumstances related to the finalisation of the new programme.  This was delayed due to procedural and technical issues between the EU managing authority and various stakeholders.  This delayed finalisation of the precise terms and conditions of the new programme.  This process was ongoing during 2015 at the time when the Revised Estimate Volume for Public Services 2016 was being completed.  Thereafter and significantly, when applications from promoters were eventually able to proceed and were received by the EU managing authority in 2016, the Brexit referendum stalled the process completely, as it was unclear what the position in respect of the EU refund would be after the UK left the EU.  There was considerable doubt for some time over whether the programme could proceed.  However, in recent weeks a resolution has been achieved.  This has involved complex discussions between the EU managing authority, the EU Commission and Government officials in Dublin, Belfast and London.  The resolution came too late for any funds to be expended in 2016.  However, expenditure will commence in 2017.<\/p> <p>  I was asked a question about Science Foundation Ireland and the &euro;27 million programme.  The additional &euro;27 million will be for equipment.  This brings the total SFI budget in 2016 to &euro;184 million.  The awards will be announced soon.  I can say that they specifically relate to the seven universities in Ireland, as well as the Royal College of Surgeons, Waterford Institute of Technology, Teagasc, and the Tyndall National Institute.

She raised a valid point.  It is a question I raised myself when I first came in to the job on awareness of the local enterprise offices.  We need to realise that the newly restructured local enterprise offices have only been in place for approximately two years.  They have forged a great relationship with Enterprise Ireland.  I am pleased the Chairman had a pleasant experience with her client in Waterford.  We give Enterprise Ireland funding towards advertising and members may have heard the organisation advertising on local radio.  As Minister of State, I travel around to the various counties.  I am focused not only on visiting the local enterprise offices but on looking at the local enterprise office companies that have been set up.  We are doing some local radio advertising in that area as well.<\/p> <p>  Under the new structure many local authorities put local enterprise offices front-of-house, although I am unsure of the position in Waterford.  In other words, when people come into the council offices, they see the LEO sign in the foyer.  They are working closely with local authorities.  We find that where a local authority and local enterprise office are working well together, the LEO works particularly well.  Most local authorities now have an economic department as well.  The three units work together.  This is where Enterprise Ireland, the Leader programme and all the other agencies come together.  It is all about collaboration.  This is the reason we have successful LEOs.<\/p> <p>  I would be delighted to invite Deputy Butler to accompany me, as Cathaoirleach of the committee, when I visit the LEO in Waterford and the associated small companies.  She will see for herself at first hand the work that Waterford LEO is doing in growing businesses.  As the Chairman noted, it is a first stop for many people who are interested in starting up a business or becoming an entrepreneur.  That is an important focus.<\/p> <p>  The LEOs and Enterprise Ireland are currently focusing on the Ireland's best young entrepreneur, IBYE, initiative.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, covered her area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire last night and I covered Fingal.  There is considerable interest in the IBYE scheme.  Last year a total of 1,400 applicants came forward and there have been 1,800 applicants this year.  The interest is a phenomenon.  We have so many young entrepreneurs who are interested in start-up companies.  We must continue to assist those young people.

It is shocking that the Department has not come before the committee to inform us of the development and that it did not communicate with us on the matter.  This issue has caused considerable concern among members of the public.  There is a massive campaign among citizens raising objections and fears as to what this legislation means.  We now have information to the effect that the courts will consider the matter again, which changes everything, and the only reason the Bill is before us is on foot of a previous court decision.  These are pretty unusual and compelling circumstances and, on that basis, I do not see any reason for the committee not to adjourn.  It would be irresponsible not to do so.  It would be viewed very poorly by citizens when there is so much concern about the legislation, a possibility that it may not be necessary at all and the certainty that the courts will consider it.  We should not get into this terrain.  Legislation that was motivated by a court decision will now be reconsidered by the courts.  It is entirely proper to await their decision.

With respect, I am disappointed that I have only learned of it literally on taking my seat to conduct the business of the meeting.

They would then be deleted from the legislation.  There are other important sections, which are not impacted by possible Supreme Court action, that we could debate and decide on now.

If Fianna F&aacute;il has decided to adopt this view then I have no choice but to accept the reality of new politics and, therefore, we cannot continue.

These Estimates were originally considered by the committee on 5 July this year and voted by the D&aacute;il on 7 July.  While the Estimates took account of the transfer of functions and resources from my Department to include new responsibilities regarding regional and rural affairs, they did not take account of the change in name of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A further Revised Estimate is necessary to effect this name change.<\/p> <p>  No adjustment of resources or functions is required as part of this further Revised Estimate, given that any such transfers were included in the Revised Estimate voted by the D&aacute;il on 7 July.  This means the gross provision available to my Department in 2016 remains at just over &euro;382 million.  In broad terms, the breakdown of allocations remains as follows: &euro;188 million for arts, culture and film; &euro;44 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; &euro;51 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; in excess of &euro;37 million for North-South co-operation; and more than &euro;61 million for regional development and rural affairs.<\/p> <p>  The performance, expenditure and targets of my Department during the first half of 2016 were considered by the Oireachtas joint committee on 28 September.

While I cannot accurately predict the full year outturn, all current funding is expected to be spent in full and no capital savings beyond those which can be carried forward by deferred surrender into 2017 are envisaged.

CL&Aacute;R has not been announced yet.  We will reach that shortly.  The amount there is &euro;7.5 million.  The Minister has probably sent out a circular to all sections in the Department from the finance officer stating that all bills for payment must be in by 12 or 15 December or there cannot be a guarantee of processing and so forth before 31 December.  Today is 1 December so that is a fortnight from today, and that is being very generous because the Minister probably sent out a circular a few weeks ago stating that they all had to be in by 5 December, if I know anything about what happens in Departments.  It appears awfully strange that the Department will be able to announce, get the work done, spend and validate &euro;7.5 million worth of CL&Aacute;R money between now and then, and that it will be able to get the work done and validation, clearance and payment carried out on the rural development schemes.  Otherwise, it appears the Minister is paying money on account to the county councils for work that perhaps has been approved in some cases and for other work that has not been approved, and that they have extraordinary permission from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to act as a type of bank.  That practice was frowned on a number of years ago by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He wrote a report ten years ago stating that the Department cannot hand the money over to local authorities without the work being done, which is what happened in the old days.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will recall from his time on the local authority that the authority used to get the money before the end of the year and spend it again.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General wrote a scathing report on that and said it could no longer happen, so the practice stopped.  The Minister appears to be saying that it has started again.  Did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform consult with the Comptroller and Auditor General before shovelling out the money before the end of the year, allowing the local authorities to become a quasi deposit bank and letting them spend it again in their own time when the Minister has lost all control?

I will be meeting with the local authorities and the CEs and I will impress on them the need for the money to be spent on the projects as soon as possible.

The second is that the Minister is having another &euro;20 million carried forward in local authority coffers.

This is money allocated for spending on work that has not been done within the calendar year.  Instead of looking at that in a positive light, as the Minister is doing, I see it in a negative light.  I view it as &euro;30 million that should have been spent on action in rural Ireland in 2016 being deferred, by one subterfuge or another, into next year.  I repeatedly told the Minister in this committee last June that the Department was going to underspend and I asked her to sanction money then.

To think that a Leader group on the border of Limerick will be delivering to the remainder of west Cork is unacceptable<\/p><p> I want to ask the Minister a straight question and I want a straight answer.  What has the Government and its predecessor got against the people of west Cork because it has been hit repeatedly?  We have lost our Garda stations.  We have lost some post offices.  Our banks have been closed and now our Leader programme, the only shining light we had in west Cork, is gone.  I pleaded with the Minister prior to the summer recess to try to bring about a resolution to this issue but the crisis has worsened.  There is no delivery.  There is no idea how we will deliver.  We do not know who will deliver the programme.  We do not know who to speak to about projects in west Cork.  If that is replicated throughout Ireland, this Leader programme is in tatters.  We need answers, and I have called for those answers over the past six or seven weeks.  This is my first opportunity to speak, and I have every right to speak on behalf of my constituents and the people of west Cork.  It is my duty to do that, and I want to know why west Cork has been treated in this way.<\/p><p> As far as I am aware, there was a call recently for expressions of interest for east Galway.  I wish the people of east Galway the best of luck, but what is the difference here?  How many expressions of interests has the Minister received because it was to her office these calls were made?  What is the difference between east Galway and west Cork?  Why has west Cork been left without a Leader programme and Leader delivery in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#D01200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy the outline on the arts programme and how the budget is made up.

Can the Minister of State confirm when he will announce the successful bidder for an air service to Inis M&oacute;r?  Earlier, I suggested that the tender would have been to the end of January or February.  The end of the year is a bad date, because from 22 December onwards people are partying or whatever and getting all the people in one place becomes more and more difficult.  We have 38 days to go but we probably have only 14 or 15 working days.  Will the Minister of State clarify where we are going in that regard?  What was it that Oscar Wilde said about one parent and two parents?  This time we have lost two, but it seems that we will lose one of the parents for a second time unless we get a shake on things.  We have reason to be concerned.<\/p> <p>  My next question for the Minister of State relates to the Leader programme.  A certain former Minister, who now has a prestigious job in Brussels, Mr. Hogan, made some policy decisions that many of us in this committee could not agree with.  They were some of the most bizarre decisions ever.  We had divided up the country in a way such that virtually everyone was happy.  Now, we are in a farcical situation.  I hear my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, giving out with some justification and arguing that he wants a west Cork-based company to supply the service in west Cork.  However, I should point out that one of the extraordinary arrangements arising as a result of this situation is that the Aran Islands company does not provide the service from the Aran Islands under the Leader programme.  How that was done?  Not only does this have an effect in terms of the delivery of the Leader programme on the islands, but it is utterly disastrous in terms of the business and employment bases in Inis Oirr.  That island has by far the best population structure of any island around the cost because it had these office jobs that were attractive for young people to stay and rear families on the island.  Can the Minister of State confirm, in answer to the remarks of Deputy Cannon, that the Department, either through the Leader, Gaeltacht, islands or some other heading, is willing to undo the tremendous mistake it has made in respect of Inis Oirr?  Can he confirm whether the Department will provide money through some guise or another to ensure that Comhar na nOile&aacute;n can maintain employment on Inis Oirr while we wait for a change of approach or a change of Government?  This would ensure that from the next iteration of the Leader programme, the companies in these areas are those which get to win the contracts and get on with the job as long as they put in a good bid.  The Minister of State need not tell me that this is not possible.  It is perfectly possible.  I simply cannot understand it.  Humpty Dumpty would not get a better arrangement by having a company in the Aran Islands providing services in Cork and someone far away from the islands providing a service to the Aran Islands.  It is unbelievable.<\/p> <p>  I will make the following point to console Deputy Michael Collins.  He might not have known it but the Aran Islands company was providing a service in west Cork for the past ten years to the islands of west Cork.  My understanding is that the company did tremendous work there and that those in the islands of west Cork had no anxiety to join the rest of west Cork in the sense of the operation being run from west Cork.  Indeed, they were keen for the service to continue operating from the Aran Islands.  Perhaps others will come back five years from now and say the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#G00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I hear what the Deputy has said.

The bringing forward of this Bill is a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government.  Ireland has designated 75 natural heritage areas, NHAs, under national law for the protection of raised bog habitats.  These sites complement the 53 areas of protected raised bog in Ireland which have been nominated for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, in accordance with the EU habitats directive.  Additional raised bog habitat within the natural heritage area network makes a contribution to maintaining or restoring these habitats to favourable conservation status.<\/p> <p>  Following an extensive process involving the examination of over 270 individual raised bogs, the review of the raised bog natural heritage area network was published in January 2014.  It set out a series of measures to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under the habitats directive and the environmental impact assessment directive, while at the same time avoiding unintended impacts on the traditional rights of landowners and users, as well as minimising the cost to the State of compensation payments.<\/p> <p>  The review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This would entail the phasing out of turf cutting on 36 existing NHAs which will remain designated.  This includes seven sites to be divided with part to be conserved and part to be de-designated.  The complete de-designation of 46 NHAs, including the relevant areas of the seven sites to be divided where it has been judged that the conservation potential is expected to be marginal or the restoration or both will be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved.  Domestic turf cutting may continue on the sites, while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems.  The designation as NHA of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, is to make up for the loss of habitat within the sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 provides for a review of raised bog habitats, making amendment and revocation of natural heritage area orders and, for those purposes, to amend the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  The Bill will provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the raised bog natural heritage area network, arising from the proposals from the review published in January 2014, an assessment of the effects on the environment of the proposals arising from the review and, if required, any other screening or an assessment, or, as the case may be, assessment undertaking, and observations or submissions received during the course of public consultation.<\/p> <p>  This Bill is an important part of our peatland strategy as we continue to deal with the need to protect the environment, live up to our EU obligations and work with landowners and turf cutters on whose lives these obligations can have a real impact.  This legislation will allow for the raised bog natural heritage area network to be managed more effectively and in a more environmentally friendly manner.  The reconfiguration of the network, which this legislation will facilitate, is based on sound scientific evidence and will have a positive impact.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is to work with the turf cutters affected in a practical and pragmatic fashion, while also working to ensure we are protecting the raised bog network and fulfilling our EU obligations.

The Bill basically allows the Minister to de-designate some NHA raised bogs on the basis that she has alternatives to put in their place.  The problem that has arisen on the raised bogs, however, could arise anywhere.  There are issues, for example, with NHAs which are blocking the provision of major infrastructure.  Maybe a similar process could be followed where not only is an individual good involved but the national good is too.<\/p><p>For many years, for example, we have been trying to build a road through the heart of Connemara and designation has been a problem.  I accept the SACs and the SPAs are virtually immutable.  However, what is proved here is that where there is a will, there is a way.  A NHA is not immutable as long as the Minister compensates - the basis of this Bill - for a NHA to be taken out with another NHA of equal standing or, maybe even in many cases, of better standing.<\/p><p>Therefore, what I sought to do in this case is to give general application to a specific instance approach taken by the Department.  I do not understand why it took the approach to have raised bogs only and it did not put in a procedure that could be applied in any case where one needs to de-designate an NHA, as happened in this case, and re-designate it with another piece of land as an NHA.<\/p><p> I will press my amendment unless I get a satisfactory answer as to why it is literally limited as a process.  If a process is in place and there are enough safeguards in it, which the Minister will tell me is the case with raised bogs, why could the same safeguards not be put in if the Department subsequently decided to de-designate some other NHA and put something else in its place?  That is what I am trying to replicate in my amendment.  Given that it has been shown that an NHA designation should not be immutable and permanent, why was a general process not put in place to allow for de-designation and re-designation of other lands as NHAs, as a generality where the case may arise and where an overriding local or national interest would warrant it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#H01400","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to speak on the related amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12016120100002#J00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1480604400,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Each of the amendments is related and to change one means to change them all.

There is a process we must go through before we could look at the blanket bogs.

Therefore, the argument put up by the Minister does not hold water.<\/p> <p>  When I was a Minister on many occasions when I went home and thought about the argument I put to the Opposition it sounded a bit hollow even to myself, not to mind the person on the other side of the argument.  When the Minister comes to do some other NHA, she might do it in a big review or in a specific review, if a specific problem arises she might follow the exact same process but the next time when she gets to the point of having a legal power to do it, she will be able to say that she has followed the process as she did with the blanket bogs and she has the legal power to do it without going back to the Oireachtas and publishing a new Bill.  In other words, the point I make is that the Minister should make the ability to do what she is trying to do in one specific instance, general, but that would not stop her continuing with the very good practice in terms of how she gets to the point of where she invokes the law.  All I am saying is that I do not see why the Minister would have to bring in a special Bill the next time she wants to make a similar change.  What we will end up with is the introduction of a County Meath NHA amendment Bill and county Connemara amendment Bill in each instance rather than saying we need to have a mechanism in place that deals with the issue, tells us the process to follow and then states that having followed all the processes, one then uses the law and makes the thing happen.

They have set out a very comprehensive process in terms of the amendment of the 2000 Act and the insertion of 18A.

I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;109 million for 2016.  The purpose of this additional Estimate is to fund the Christmas bonus, which is being paid to Vote 37 for social assistance recipients this week.  Overall, the Christmas bonus is estimated to cost &euro;220 million and, as Deputies will be aware, I am able to provide for an 85% bonus this year, which is up from 75% last year.  It is being paid over the course of this week to approximately 1.25 million customers, thereby providing a significant boost for local economies throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The cost is broken down into &euro;106 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;114 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients, mainly people in receipt of the State contributory pension.  The Social Insurance Fund is funding the entire cost of the bonus being paid this week to people on contributory payments, such as the State pension contributory, invalidity pension and so forth.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on the Supplementary Estimate, as the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  Income from pay-related social insurance, PRSI, receipts during 2016 will result in Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated &euro;9.15 billion.  This will be &euro;260 million or 3% ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;650 million or 7.7% ahead of the position in 2015.  This is a very positive development and is clear evidence that the economy generally, and employment in particular, are on an upward trajectory.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration is expected to cost &euro;8.77 billion.  This is &euro;104 million or 1.2% ahead of profile, but that is entirely accounted for by the cost of the Christmas bonus of &euro;114 million to Social Insurance Fund customers.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus is expected to be approximately &euro;350 million this year.  It will be the first surplus in the Social Insurance Fund since 2007, nine years ago.  My intention is to keep running surpluses in the coming years because we must be prepared for the next downturn when it comes and for the jobseeker's payments which will follow.  Obviously when there is a downturn, inevitably income into the fund goes down and expenditure goes up.  We also must prepare long term for the ageing population and the rising cost of pensions.<\/p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2016 is expected to be &euro;19.838 billion.  This will be &euro;213 million or 1.1% more than was provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates.  The higher expenditure is due solely to the payment of the Christmas bonus.  The live register is expected to average at approximately 304,300 in 2016.  This is a reduction of 40,000 on the average for 2015, or 141,000 better than the average for 2011.  The estimated cost of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;30.2 million is being offset by underspends elsewhere in jobseeker's allowance allocation, so no additional allocation is required for jobseekers in the Supplementary Estimate.  The improving labour market and the decline in the live register has also seen a decline in demand for employment supports.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 Supplementary Estimate referred by the D&aacute;il and the briefing provided to committee members list the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as some underspends.  We can go through the position of individual schemes as required during the meeting.  Members might wish to note that almost all of the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  Estimates of expenditure for any scheme for the following year are published in December as part of the Revised Estimate Volume.  The individual Estimates are constructed on a scheme-by-scheme basis, using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors as are available for that portion of the year in which the Estimates are calculated.  Trends can, and do, change over the course of the year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than was provided for in the original Estimates.<\/p> <p>  Actual expenditure on most of our schemes will never be precisely on target because of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.  Thus, for example, we expect a significant overspend on schemes such as the carer's allowance this year.  This is primarily due to the continuing rise in the number of applications.  In the first half of this year the number of new applications for carer's allowance increased by 19% compared with the same period in the previous year.  We are also processing more claims for the scheme.  As of the end of October, we had processed almost 26,550 claims so far this year.  That compares with 24,190 in all of 2015 and 21,250 in 2014.  The rising number of claims every year is part of the reason for the delays in processing the applications and it is also a cost to us.<\/p> <p>  I hope my statement has given the committee a broad overview of the Department's expenditure in 2016 and the reason for the necessity to seek a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  This Estimate only deals with non-contributory payments as insurance contribution-related payments are dealt with from the Social Insurance Fund and this accounts for just over half of the annual expenditure on social protection.  I note that the number in receipt of non-contributory pensions is only 130 over profile, so the big increase in pensioners is obviously in respect of State pensioners.  I do not have an objection to the Supplementary Estimate but I have a few ancillary questions for the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will recall that representations were made to both him and his predecessor regarding the abolition of the retirement pension, where people are compelled by the terms of their employment to retire at 65 years of age but they must wait a year, and it will shortly be two years, for a pension.  In such cases, many of them are obliged to seek jobseeker's allowance.  I was informed that an interdepartmental group is examining this issue to see how it can be resolved, and I thank the Department for recognising that there is a problem in this regard.  Can the Minister give an update on that?  Will the Minister also say what the extra cost would be to the Exchequer in respect of pensions if the pensions had been paid from 1 January rather than from 7 March?<\/p> <p>  As regards the one-parent family payment, I notice the work-related family dividend is 900 over profile.  In other words, 900 fewer people than anticipated availed of the family dividend.  What are the implications of that?<\/p> <p>  I note that the increase for rent supplement is just over &euro;9 million.  That reflects the change in the levels introduced by the Government.  Does the Minister have a figure for how much was spent on discretionary payments?  He will note that his predecessor issued a notification to all local welfare officers that, in certain cases, discretion could be exercised where people did not strictly meet the requirements of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to demographic trends and the difficulty of anticipating how many people will qualify, present and so forth.  However, some of the figures are quite large, for example, disability allowance and carer's allowance were 5% and 19%, respectively, over what was anticipated.  Carer's grant must be paid to 7,580 more people than anticipated and the domiciliary care allowance has to be paid to 12% more people than anticipated.  The Minister is seeking an increase of &euro;1.3 million for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  According to the figures provided, that will benefit 4,140 customers.  It shows that even small increases in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance have a wide impact.  It appears to be a very efficient way to target poverty.<\/p> <p>  The opposite is the case with the farm assist scheme.<\/p><p>It was paid to 800 fewer people than was anticipated.  Can the Minister comment on how the changes he is introducing will affect that and give us some idea of what he anticipates this will cost and how many will avail of it next year?  I also note there is a &euro;21.5 million underspend on community employment, CE, schemes.  The Minister will note a lot of agitation on the ground about the rules surrounding these schemes and the difficulty in qualifying for them, particularly for people on the JobPath scheme who want to transfer to the CE scheme.  In view of the underspend the Minister might consider relaxing some of those rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#B00300","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I know that much of the Supplementary Estimate deals with the Christmas bonus and the 85% allocation this year, which was announced with great fanfare.  Many people, however, are disappointed because when the Minister made the announcement the perception was that it was for everyone in receipt of social welfare but many people found out that they had to be in receipt of social welfare for 15 months or more.  One lady contacted me who has been receiving illness benefit since 2005, which is certainly a long-standing payment but she was told absolutely not when she inquired about the Christmas bonus.  While it was a good news story for the Minister, it would have been better if it had been a 100% restoration.  Many people who rely on that payment are very concerned.<\/p> <p>  The Minister extended the benefits for the self-employed, which was a positive and welcome first step.  When I questioned him he said he had not started to engage with the bodies who were expected to provide the services under the extended benefits, opticians and dentists, and that he would initiate that process.  Where is that process?  I was concerned that it was putting the cart before the horse.  We know from previous experience the difficulties that arose when the Minister adopted that strategy in a previous ministerial position.  <\/p> <p>  The underspend on JobBridge is not surprising.  We know the reasons for it.  There is no replacement scheme.  The Minister said one is being worked on.  We await that eagerly.  There is an underspend of &euro;12 million in the Gateway project.  Many local authorities have availed of the scheme.  I have criticised it because it is replacing what should be proper, full-time paid positions within local authorities. Does the underspend indicate that the scheme is being wound down?  If so, what is the rationale for that?  Is there a replacement scheme?  Are the participants going to be employed by local authorities?  <\/p> <p>  There is an underspend of &euro;25 million in the CE schemes.  We know how difficult it is for people to get on the scheme.  Many communities rely heavily on the scheme and that underspend sets off many alarm bells.  I am concerned, as are the community groups I work with, and I am sure many other Deputies have the same experience.  Can the Minister explain that? <\/p> <p>  None of the figures for JobPath is contained in the Estimates.  I have put a series of questions to the Minister.  We have seen privatisation of that area, a substantial body of work has been handed over to a private entity.  When I ask about it I am told the figures are commercially sensitive.  It is madness that a substantial sum of money is being allocated to Seetec and Turas Nua but we do not know how much.  Are the savings in the Estimates on administration and other areas due to the roll out of JobPath and the privatisation of that area?  This is making a serious impact.  I have spoken to many employees from local employment services across the State and the referrals coming to the local employment services, LES, from the Department are falling.  The fear is that because of the privatisation of that essential service, the LES is being wound down.  The Minister always bandies figures for official complaints about JobPath but many will not make an official complaint.  A person was in contact with me, a qualified journalist, who had been working part time, was then out of work and was referred to JobPath.  No disrespect to the young man who dealt with the client but he did not appear to have the necessary skills or qualifications for the job because the curriculum vitae he wrote up was pockmarked with all sorts of spelling and grammatical errors.  There are serious widespread problems.  It is madness to privatise that critical area when we as elected Members of the Oireachtas cannot see how much is spent.<\/p> <p>  Only this week I received the number of individuals penalised for not participating for whatever reason.  We have not seen the grounds or rationale for that.  In Wexford 42 individuals were penalised, 11 in Wicklow and a substantial number in Galway.  There are serious problems in JobPath and the Minister has said repeatedly that it is too early to initiate a review of it but the evidence speaks volumes.  There are serious problems, from its administration to its impact on the LES across the State and on those who are penalised.<\/p><p>It is having a huge impact on the individuals who are being penalised and we cannot get answers.  We do not know how much it is costing.  It is time for a comprehensive review of JobPath.<\/p><p> Through a series of parliamentary questions and through publicity, we are aware of the large number of carer's allowance appeals going to the social welfare appeals office.  What proportion of applicants are successful, given the Minister's reference to a 19% increase in claims?  There are significant problems with the administration of the allowance with the waiting time for appeals being up to 40 weeks.<\/p><p> Since the abolition of the State transition pension, more than 4,000 people aged 65 have been forced to sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  This is higher than for any other age cohort.  The figure raises concern and sets off many alarm bells.  I have made contributions in the House regarding this pension and specific cases where people hit the retirement age of 65 and were then forced to sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  The Minister may say serious pressure is not put on them to find a job when they hit that age but once they sign on for jobseeker's allowance, they have to ensure they are available for work and actively seek work.  It is a significant concern and I would like him to touch on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#C00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate.

It was a prudent budget designed to reduce the deficit and make sure the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  Any changes will be modest.  On previous occasions, when the Christmas bonus was paid, there were press briefings, photo calls and so on.  I have not done any of that.  I do not wish to criticise my predecessor but she had a big photo call and all the rest of it.  I deliberately decided not to do any of that for obvious reasons.  I do not wish to make out that this is a giveaway; it is nothing of the sort.<\/p> <p>  The issue of people retiring aged 65 and not receiving the State pension until they are 66 is taxing my mind at the moment.  Deputy O'Dea mentioned it and he will be interested to know that while I was walking around the milk market in Limerick the other day, I met somebody who was required to retire at 65 but did not want to.  She still has lots to offer but she is on the jobseeker's allowance until she receives her pension.  She does not particularly want her pension at 66.  She is a young 65 and still wants to work.  Why should she not?  We need to do something about this.  It should have been joined up at the time but it was not.  That was a mistake made by the previous Government, of which I was a member.  When the State pension age was increased, we should have introduced the other measures at the same time but that was not done.  It is important though to remember that there is no compulsory retirement age in Ireland.  Nobody is required to retire at 65 and, therefore, they are not forced to sign on.  They can take a new job.  Many people in their 70s are working.  It is not that anyone is forced to sign on or is required by law to retire but many people, particularly public servants, are required to retire at 65 under the terms of their contracts.  An interdepartmental group looked into this.<\/p><p>It reported before the summer but it did not come up with enough.  It was one of these interdepartmental groups where the report indicated what we needed to consider, whereas I would usually think a group would come up with solutions.  I have a particular interest in this, as does the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who has responsibility for older people.  I have written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, about this, particularly with regard to public servants.  When it comes to our own staff, surely we should be in a position to say that if they do not want to retire at 65, they can wait until they are 66 or 67.  In areas like the health service it would be useful as it is quite hard to replace consultants and others who retire at 65 and before they want to.<\/p><p> I had a very interesting meeting with representatives of the Unite trade union during the week who told me about the law in Northern Ireland.  It might not be true but I am checking it; this is where I will say something good about Northern Ireland for a change.  Apparently the law in Northern Ireland means that if somebody is required to retire by a contract before the state retirement age, that person must be informed six months in advance and the onus is on the employer to prove why that person must retire at 65 rather than the state retirement age of 66 or 67.  That approach might provide a solution for us.  I need to check that and it might be something we could do in the spring Bill.  As far as I am concerned we need to increase the State pension age.  In the 1970s, when many of us here were born, the State pension age was 70 and people lived until they were 72 or 73.  The State pension age is now 66 and people live until their 80s.  One does not need a masters degree in maths to understand why we have a problem funding pensions.  We need to raise the State retirement age but we also need to facilitate people in working longer, particularly if they want to.  I hope we can sort that out in the first half of next year.<\/p><p> If we brought payment of the pension increase forward to 1 January, the additional cost would have been &euro;23 million and for all payments it would have been closer to &euro;70 million.  The rent supplement increase is &euro;9 million and we will come back with the figures for the discretionary payments element.  We know that since rent supplement limits were increased, the number of discretionary payments required fell off dramatically, although they are starting to tick up again.  The reason the increase is not as big as one might think is because of the transfer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  When we move from rent supplement to HAP, the budget moves from our Department to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There are also fewer people on rent supplement because more people are back working.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised disability and carers' payments, particularly the delays in processing carers' payments.  That has improved substantially, coming down from approximately 19 weeks to approximately 13 or 14 weeks now.  We need to keep bringing that down.  I have been to Longford, where staff are based, and met them.  Additional staff are being provided but it is quite a specialised area so those staff will need to be trained for a while.  The longer they are working there, the more quickly they will make decisions.  It is something we are working on.  There was a big increase in the spending for the carer support grant because we publicised the fact that one does not need to be in receipt of carer's allowance to get the carer support grant.  Many people did not know that and thought if they did not qualify for the carer's allowance, they could not get the carer support grant.  They can and we publicised that fact a bit this year, getting a flood of additional applications to Longford, which was good.<\/p><p> We are wondering about the increase in the number of people on disability and carer payments and we are trying to examine it in more detail.  Demographics is a major factor and there are more people and particularly older people in the country.  If there are more people and older people, there will be more people with disabilities and who need care.  It is partly about demographics but it is not all about them.  We are a bit concerned that there may be a drift in people from the jobseeker's allowance to carer's or disability allowance.  I would come across that in my constituency work.  There are people on jobseeker's allowance who probably should be on disability allowance because they are unable to work, which is fine, but there are people who certainly come into my office who are under pressure to take up employment.  I am surprised when they say to my face \"I am thinking of going on the sick, what do you reckon?\"  We believe there is a drift of people who are benefit shopping and moving from a payment with conditionality and activation attached to one that does not.  We have that concern but we do not yet have figures to back it up.  We must be very much aware of that.<\/p><p> The outturn in the farm assist programme this year was &euro;79 million and the estimated expenditure next year is &euro;82.8 million.  These are guesses, or intelligent estimates, as Deputies know the way in which farm incomes work.  They are very dependent on the price of milk or beef.  Given that we are fully reversing the cuts made in the past couple of years, the number of families benefitting might increase from approximately 8,000 to 10,000.  We should bear in mind that any family, even those currently in receipt of it, will get more.  This will be affected by the rural social scheme, RSS, as there are 500 more spaces on that.  Those who move from farm assist to RSS come off one budget and on to another despite being the same people.<\/p><p> There is an underspend on community employment, CE, this year.  Many people have speculated on this, as we have seen today, but the main reason is obvious.  There are half as many unemployed as there were four years ago.  Unemployment has gone down from 15% to 7.5% and in that time, the number of schemes has increased by over 50%.  There used to be a certain number of people applying for a certain number of schemes but now we have fewer people applying to more schemes.  The overriding reason there are fewer people on the schemes is that there are half as many people unemployed as there have been.  The number of schemes increased significantly during the recession but we have not pared them back all that much.  I know many CE supervisors around the country are blaming it on JobPath but that bothers me because it fundamentally misunderstands what JobPath does.  It is not another scheme, like CE, T&uacute;s, or Gateway.  JobPath is the process of somebody being worked with intensively for a year, essentially being recruited into employment.  If somebody goes on CE or T&uacute;s, he or she is still a cost to the Exchequer.  Somebody who gets a job through JobPath moves from being somebody dependent on a State payment to somebody who is not receiving a State payment and is working and paying tax.  One can think of the benefit for the individual and society.  If after a year that person does not get a job, once again he or she becomes eligible for CE and T&uacute;s.  I get really bothered when I get letters from CE supervisors and others suggesting that in some way, JobPath is competing with them or taking their people.  That is akin to saying a person has a job in a factory or a restaurant and cannot be kept on welfare.  It is a totally wrong approach and I get worried about CE supervisors who think that way and who see real and gainful employment paid for by someone else, with taxes being paid into the system, as something that is in competition with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#D00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Many of the jobs that people are getting with that are not sustainable or long-term.

We can have a conversation or debate without always having to interrupt people.  It is just basic manners.  Opinion is not fact.  If somebody works a 40-hour week on the minimum wage in Ireland, it is almost &euro;400 per week and the CE programme pays less than &euro;200.  Somebody on the minimum wage in Ireland working 30 hours per week is better off than somebody on CE so why would we want to lock somebody on a scheme rather than allow him or her get a minimum wage job?  That job is better paid than any scheme we have to offer.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned privatisation.<\/p><p>Seetec is a for-profit company.  Turas Nua is generally not-for-profit but many community employment, CE, sponsors and T&uacute;s sponsors are also private entities, and some of them are companies too.  It is not unprecedented, therefore, to have services outsourced to private providers.<\/p><p> Something I do intend to do, and I would hope people accept that this is the way forward because I acknowledge that some CE schemes and many CE supervisors are having trouble filling their positions, is to relax the rules in January to widen the pool of people eligible for CE.  Widening the pool will mean that the people schemes have to choose from will be a harder to reach group of people who need some more support and work.  Some CE schemes and CE supervisors will be happy with that because they are going back to their original effort, namely, social inclusion as well as employment activation, which is helping people who really need help and have difficulty holding down a job.  Others would prefer to be able to pick from a wider bunch of easier to work with people, but that is not where we should be, and now that we are back in a situation where we are approaching low unemployment, CE schemes should be more for people who cannot get minimum wage jobs or any job.  That is why I intend to relax those rules in the new year to widen the pool of people who can access CE and T&uacute;s but not to prevent them from getting gainful employment, even if it is a minimum wage job.<\/p><p> On the back to work family dividend, it is a new scheme.  It is difficult to estimate what the cost of it will be but we can give the Deputy more information on that if he wishes.<\/p><p> On the Christmas bonus, Christmas bonuses were only ever paid to long-term payment recipients.  It was always the case that they have to be on long-term payment to avail of the Christmas bonus.  It was never paid to people on illness benefit.  Somebody should not be on illness benefit since 2005.  I do not want to comment on an individual case but if the Deputy gives us the details, we will look into it.  It is supposed to be a short-term payment so somebody who is on it for that length of time should be on disability or invalidity pension, in which case they would receive the bonus.<\/p><p> On the opticians and the dentists, I had a very good meeting with the dentists last week and we are now in the position where we are trying to determine how it will work, but I am more confident than I might have been a week or two ago that we will be able to meet the March and October deadlines.  That meeting went well.  They have their requests, but that engagement will happen now at official level.  I will be speaking at one of their conferences in the new year and I would hope we will have that done within the timeframe for which we budgeted.<\/p><p> On Gateway, there is a significant underspend on Gateway.  That is down to less interest from local authorities.  The scheme is still in place.  Many local authorities are not as interested in it as they were in the past.  Sometimes that is because they are taking on people.  My local authority, Fingal, hired some people who were in Gateway, which was welcome.  In some cases, however, unions have withdrawn co-operation with Gateway, and for that reason local authorities are less interested.  The programme remains in place but we are considering winding it down.  Like JobBridge, it was a scheme for its time and there is less need for it now than would have been the case in the past.  We are considering the possibility of having a local authority arm and bringing it in under T&uacute;s rather than having a separate scheme, but a definite decision on that has not yet been made.<\/p><p> On the penalties, I reiterate that the only body that can impose penalty rates on anyone is the Department of Social Protection.  JobPath, Seetec, Turas Nua, local employment services and any of the rest of them cannot impose penalty rates.  That can only be done by the Department deciding officer.  Someone is less likely to have a penalty rate imposed on them if they are on JobPath than on Intreo, which is interesting.  People working with our case officers in Intreo are more likely to have a penalty rate imposed on them than those who are referred to JobPath, which is a point worth making.<\/p><p> So far in 2016, we reckon approximately 10,000 people will have had a penalty rate imposed on them at some point so we are talking about only 2% or 3% of people.  To be frank, in the real world there are 2% or 3% of people who do not engage and what do we do about that?  Should we tell them it is fine not to engage, that they do not have to turn up for interviews or training or do anything, that we do not care and that they should just keep taking the money?  There are 1% or 2% of people who will have penalty rates imposed on them for not participating and engaging, and we will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#E00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding this, and I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to relax the rules relating to community employment, but my experience of JobPath has been that if people have been unemployed and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for a certain period of time, that is sufficient to qualify for the JobPath scheme.  However, they have come to me and said they are not offered employment.  In some cases they are offered jobs that are so far away from where they live, they would be at a net loss if they took them.  Generally, however, many of them have not been offered employment and when a CE scheme comes up in an area for which they would be very suitable, they find that the cannot qualify for it because they are on JobPath.  Obviously, they would be better off on the CE scheme than on jobseeker's allowance and they would be doing something useful.  They would be working.  That is the problem quite a few people are presenting to me.<\/p> <p>  I take the Minister's point that the JobPath companies do not impose penalties but the people I am dealing with, and perhaps I am unique in this, are terrorised by JobPath.  They have had some very bad experiences with JobPath.  I do not know if other people have had this experience but when people complain to me, they tell me not to use their name because the JobPath people will give a very bad report on them to the Department of Social Protection and they will be penalised.<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated during the last Question Time in the D&aacute;il that a customer satisfaction survey was being done among customers of JobPath.

Have those discussions been initiated?<\/p> <p>  On the Gateway scheme, the Minister said it was a scheme for its time, that it may be time to replace it and that he was considering the possibility of introducing a sort of T&uacute;s scheme for local authorities.  There is work to be done by local authorities but the proper way to do it is by increasing the number of staff within local authorities because much of the work that was being carried out by participants on Gateway was previously carried out by full-time paid employees of local authorities.  Rather than putting in place another scheme like T&uacute;s to replace Gateway, the Minister should start to employ more staff within local authorities.  The work needs to be done.  People need proper paid employment.  Surely that is the way to go about this rather than putting in place another low-cost cheap labour initiative.  That is not the route to take.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to CE schemes.  I do not want to repeat everything that was said earlier but there are major concerns about those, particularly in terms of people on JobPath not being able to take up CE schemes.  The Minister spoke about relaxing the rules to increase the pool of people.  I would like a briefing note from the Minister in the coming week laying out exactly what he means and the rules that will be relaxed.  That is critical, particularly for people who are locked into JobPath.  I do not want to put individual cases to the Minister here but one man who came to me did not know how to turn on a computer yet he has to go into the JobPath office every week and is put sitting in front of a computer that he does not even know how to turn on.<\/p><p>I do not see what benefits are in place for such an individual.  Many people must travel long distances at a huge cost on a weekly basis to carry out pointless tasks that do not improve their chances of employment.  There are no travel allowances for such individuals.  There are huge problems with JobPath and community employment schemes.  I would like the Minister to brief us on the matter.<\/p><p> I wish to make a final point about the huge problems with pensions and the State transition pension.  The Minister may be aware that I have tabled a Private Members' motion for next week on the gender inequality relating to pensions and the difficulties that 65 year olds face.  We need a broader discussion on pensions and I hope my Private Members' motion will act as the starting point in that regard.  I look forward to debating this complex issue.  I view the matter in simple terms: forcing 65 year olds on to the jobseeker's scheme is unsustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#F00300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments and his intention to relax the rules relating to CE and broaden the pool of people who are eligible to participate.

I agree with Deputy Brady that local authorities should take on more staff.

I particularly encourage Sinn F&eacute;in to do this in Dublin city.<\/p> <p>  On Gateway and supplies to any scheme, the initiative often gives somebody something to do every day and a bit of work experience.  One will have individuals who might apply for an outdoor job as a general operative with a local authority but he or she will not succeed because he or she has no experience.  The Gateway scheme will give a person the experience necessary to subsequently get the job.  There is always a role for these programmes.<\/p> <p>  I have not decided exactly which rules to relax and I am totally open to receiving submissions and suggestions from individuals or committee members.  I ask everyone to bear in mind a valid point made by Deputy Brady to the effect that people can get locked into JobPath for 12 months.  I advise that people can get locked into a CE scheme for three, six or ten years.  I want to relax the rules in a way that will give people who do not currently have the opportunity to participate in CE or on other schemes the opportunity to do so.  I do not want to relax the rules in such a way that allows people to get locked in, not just for 12 months but for six and ten years.  In the past people got stuck on these schemes and ended up on a never ending cycle of welfare schemes.  There is an exception.  Part of any reform should recognise the fact that there is a group of people in society who would struggle to hold down a job for lots of different reasons.  We should be honest about that and treat them differently.  I do not want people locked into schemes.  One meets people all the time who genuinely believe that they can never move on from schemes and that they are the only option for them.  That is not true.  It is important that we do not allow people to be institutionalised on a programme or a scheme because that would not be in their best interests.  They sometimes suit the organisation because they become very experienced and good at what they do but it is not the right thing for them.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question about the carers' claims, we do not have that information to hand but we will give the Deputy that figure when we have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016120100002#G01500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480590000,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I am about to conclude.
