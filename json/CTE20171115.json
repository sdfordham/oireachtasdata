I am registered with the Irish College of General Practitioners as a contraceptive tutor and a tutor in the provision of long-acting reversible contraception.  I am a member of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health and the Irish Association of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Providers.<\/p> <p>  I have been the medical director of the Irish Family Planning Association since 2008.  The IFPA is Ireland's leading sexual health charity.  It promotes the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health information and dedicated, confidential and affordable health care.  We operate two not-for-profit medical clinics where we deliver services, including contraception, post-abortion medical check-ups, cervical screenings, and screenings for sexually transmitted infections.  We also have ten centres nationwide where we provide free pregnancy counselling and post-abortion counselling services. <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I work in the context of an extremely restrictive legal framework, principally, the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  We are also bound by two pieces of legislation that include criminal sanctions, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and the Abortion Information Act.  Navigating these complex legal barriers while trying to maintain a caring clinical relationship is an immense challenge for us as health care providers.<\/p> <p>  This presentation will address the socio-economic dimensions of crisis pregnancy, and the impacts of current Irish law on women who experience an unintended pregnancy or a pregnancy that has become a crisis for other reasons.  I have included case vignettes in appendix one to this submission to further illustrate women's decision-making.  I am happy to expand on issues raised in these afterwards.   <\/p> <p>  An unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence among women of reproductive age.  While for some women this is a joyful and welcome situation, for many it is a traumatic and devastating life event.  Conversely, a wanted or planned pregnancy can become a crisis.  An unintended pregnancy can mean the difference between a woman determining her own future or seeing her plans derailed and her aspirations frustrated. <\/p> <p>  In 2016, more than 3,000 women and girls gave Irish addresses at UK abortion clinics.  These women were from all walks of life and from every county in Ireland.  In addition, as Dr. Abigail Aiken explained in an earlier session, women are increasingly accessing the abortion pill online.<\/p> <p>  Clients of IFPA doctors and pregnancy counsellors include women who have made a decision to have an abortion for a wide range of reasons related to their physical and mental health and well-being, and their ability to cope with a pregnancy.  The majority of our clients who consider abortion do so because to continue an unintended pregnancy would be an intolerable burden at this time in their life.  Any meaningful change from the current legal situation must include these women.<\/p> <p>  Each woman weighs up her particular circumstances very carefully before deciding that she is unable to cope with a pregnancy.  The factors a woman considers include the following: her family situation; her income; her social support networks; her plans for education; her working conditions; and her social and physical environments in terms of housing, relationships and so on.  Many women in this situation already have children.  They know what it means to be a mother.  For them, the need to care for their children is the primary reason that they decide not to continue with another pregnancy.  A woman may be trapped in an abusive relationship, or fear that continuing the pregnancy will trap her and her children into a lifelong relationship with an abuser. <\/p> <p>  Pregnancy counselling services, such as the IFPA, can support women through their decision-making and give them information about abortion services.  Increasingly, our clients are women who experience multiple forms of disadvantage which, in turn, restrict access to abortion.  Indeed, the term \"socio-economic\" masks the reality that an unintended pregnancy can have devastating impacts on a woman's life and that of her family. <\/p> <p>  Once a woman in Ireland has made the decision to have an abortion, she is faced with a range of further obstacles and difficulties.  Cost will be a significant factor in the decision of almost every woman.  She will need to consider the practical supports available to her and ask herself the following questions.  Can she organise child care?  Can she get a sick certificate from her doctor?  Can her partner get time off to accompany her?  As a migrant woman, is she legally able to leave the country?  Will she be able to navigate the immigration procedures?  If she has a disability, how will this impact on her ability to access care?  Not everyone lives in Dublin or Cork.  Women who live at a distance from the major cities, particularly if they are dependent on public transport, may have a very lengthy journey to an airport if they decide to travel to the UK for a safe and legal abortion.  Clearly, this constitutes a further significant barrier.  For minors, all of these matters are immensely more complicated. <\/p> <p>  Non-judgmental, non-directive counselling by a trained professional can be a huge support to a woman at this time, but it is no substitute for access to services.  We cannot ignore the fact that socio-economic factors frequently determine whether a woman travels for a legal abortion or resigns herself to the reality that her only option is an illegal abortion.  For some women, the obstacles are insurmountable and they are forced to continue the pregnancy against their wishes. <\/p> <p>  When abortion is criminalised, as it is in Ireland, the burden of accessing care falls on the woman rather than the health care system.  This is because, whether a woman travels abroad for legal services or has an illegal abortion in Ireland, she must leave the mainstream health care service.  Her experience will not meet international health care standards such as those of the World Health Organization and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. <\/p> <p>  If a woman decides to travel for abortion, the information Act prohibits her doctor from making a referral to services in another State, even if she does not speak English, has a poor educational level or has an underlying medical condition.  Unlike any other medical treatment situation, the continuum of care is broken.  The onus shifts to the patient to make contact with a doctor outside of Ireland and to provide her medical history.  She must make her way to a private medical facility in another country without the supports that apply in other situations where people travel for health care.<\/p> <p>  A woman who is unable to travel, or for other reasons opts for an illegal abortion, is faced with the challenge of trying to find a reliable online provider without medical assistance.  She also risks prosecution under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act if she self-induces abortion, as does anyone who assists her.  In either scenario, an underlying medical condition that is easily managed in the context of legal abortion may become more risky.<\/p> <p>  Yet another way in which care falls below acceptable standards is a lack of contraceptive provision.  As Professor Arulkumaran told this committee, best practice in the context of where abortion is legal is that contraception is offered as part of integrated abortion care at the initial presentation and the post-abortion consultation.  For women in Ireland, this is not the case.  This may be because her first presentation is not with a doctor, and so she does not have immediate access to contraceptive information.  Online abortion pill providers are not in a position to provide ongoing contraception.  I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception, which are the most effective.  <\/p> <p>  All of these failures of care are related to the disruption and fragmentation of care in the context of restrictive criminal abortion laws.  We see this also in relation to post-abortion care.  Women who can access abortion in their own country have a clear post-abortion care pathway with the same provider.  In the event of complications, there are robust and timely pathways for referral, as recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG.  This is not the case for women who travel from Ireland.  While free post-abortion care is funded by the HSE, and available to women from providers such as the IFPA, our experience is that only a small number of women avail of it.<\/p><p>Women who access illegal abortions receive a still lower standard of care.  In addition to the fragmented care pathway, they risk inadvertently accessing medication from an unreliable online source which could be inactive, inadequate or potentially harmful.  In my clinical experience, women accessing medication online tend to report problems late.  Fear of prosecution is a real deterrent to accessing health care for some of these women.<\/p><p> A substantial number of women are accessing abortion in this way.  As Dr. Aiken made clear, most women experience relief at the availability of this option, but that is not to say that it is acceptable health care.  It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.<\/p><p> In considering the real health concerns associated with the criminalisation of abortion, we must not forget the impact of stigma on women.  Research by the American Psychological Association has found that feelings of stigma, perceived need for secrecy, exposure to anti-abortion picketing and low perceived or anticipated social support for the abortion decision negatively impact women&rsquo;s post-abortion psychological experiences.  Every day, IFPA counsellors hear from women about these experiences.  Women&rsquo;s privacy and informed consent are invaded in ways that do not happen when services are locally available.  Some women must make multiple disclosures of a private and personal health situation to, for example, community welfare officers, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, staff in direct provision centres and social workers.  Decisions made at this level can turn obstacles into barriers.  Women&rsquo;s dignity is violated at every step.  Their right to confidentiality is taken from them so many times, right up to the moment when they find themselves in taxis from airports to abortion clinics with women they do not know. <\/p><p> In conclusion, our legal system imposes a significant burden on women at a time of crisis and stress in their lives.  It criminalises women and health care providers.  All women are disadvantaged and discriminated against when they are forced to travel to another state to access abortion services, and even more so if they access illegal abortion.  The requirement to travel for abortion forces a reduced quality of care on women.  Again, this is even more the case with illegal abortion.  We have an urgent need for safe and legal abortion care in this country.  This means equitable access, regardless of socio-economic status, to high quality, affordable, local services in Ireland that respect women&rsquo;s autonomy and decision making.  As a society, we must take responsibility for ensuring that this becomes a reality in law and in health care practice.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I am happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The usual issue that arises is that the woman will have been delayed.  There will have been several appointments and she will have been delayed in seeking care.  Obviously, we do not know if some women are deterred completely because if that is the case, we will not see them.  However, the counsellors see women who have had negative experiences in such agencies.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the socio-economic effects on mental health, particularly in respect of pregnancy, socio-economic factors and mental health are very much intertwined in every aspect of life.  Sometimes the socio-economic burden of an unintended pregnancy can have a negative effect on somebody's mental health.  It becomes very difficult to separate those issues because in most such cases, many different issues are present.  Obviously, if somebody is concerned about, perhaps, an abusive partner, this becomes much more likely and it is more likely that her mental health will suffer if she is in a pregnancy she feels she cannot manage.  The two issues are very much intertwined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>With regard to some of the examples the witness provided to the committee in the appendix, she spoke about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and some of the difficulties that has presented.

If somebody presents and one feels there is a possibility she might qualify for an abortion under the Act, one cannot have any certainty about that.  One can only say to her that there is a possibility that she might be considered for an abortion under the Act.  One can explain the procedures, which are that she will have to be seen first by an obstetrician and then either by another obstetrician or another physician or two psychiatrists for a decision to be reached.  If somebody is suffering from mental ill health, for example, it is quite likely she will be attending a psychiatrist already.  She might have already disclosed that and she has now disclosed her situation to a counsellor or a doctor.  The prospect of having to go through three more similar investigations with another medical person is off-putting for her.  Our experience, and it is not huge because not many women will qualify under the Act anyway, is that where these issues arise, the woman will choose to travel if she has the means.  She does not want to have the uncertainty and the rigour of having to go through the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will save the remainder of the Deputy's time for the next session.

The presentation was absolutely excellent.  I was struck by Dr. Henchion's comment that unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence.  This committee has spent a great deal of time considering circumstances of rape, fatal foetal abnormality and the woman's health.  In the experience of the IFPA, the majority of women who decide to access abortion would not fit into those categories.  Perhaps she will expand on that and, by implication, what that means for this committee.

The vast majority of them are far more complex and involve many socio-economic factors.  As to what those factors are, there are as many different sets of circumstances as there are women.  Various combinations of factors occur.  It might be a young woman who is still in education or very early on a career path who does not have the support of a partner and who feels she will damage her future by continuing with the pregnancy.  It might be an older woman who has children and has just got back into the workplace.  As in the first vignette I gave, there might be financial difficulties for that family that they are trying to get through and they feel another pregnancy would stop them being able to get their lives back on track.<\/p><p>We have some women with very severe forms of disadvantage.  For example, some women are battling addiction and might have children in care.  They are on a pathway out of addiction and have accessed services.  They have succeeded in keeping sober.  They just feel that the mental health toll of a pregnancy and the fact of having another baby might put their goal of getting their plans back on track out of their reach.  There are a vast number of different situations that occur.  Trying to set out a list of conditions that would fulfil a socio-economic criteria  is unrealistic.  The only way to deal with that is to have some sort of open access so that these conditions can be met.  Whether the committee decides to put gestational limits in place for that is a matter for the Government.  To ask women to meet certain criteria does not recognise the complexity of the issue in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Two things are apparent to me but I do not want to put words in the mouth of Dr. Henchion.

When I am at work in my clinic I provide contraception for a good part of my day, which is fine.  I can only see the people who make it in to see me.  That means the women must know that a contraceptive service is available, be able to afford contraception services and know where to access them.  First, one needs good quality education and awareness programmes so that women are aware of contraceptive methods and where to access them.<\/p> <p>  Second, one must remove the financial barrier.  Without question there is a financial barrier.  A person with a medical card can access services for free.  However, a person on the cusp of not having a medical card who is not well off cannot access services.  I have seen what happens when women seek long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, such as the Mirena coil or whatever.  They are really interested and want it because they want to be very safe.  Quite often, when I outline the cost to them they defer their decision.  Unfortunately, some of those women end up using much less safe methods.

To be perfectly honest, I cannot see why anybody inserted a 14-year prison sentence unless one wanted it to have a chilling effect.  That seems obvious.  As a group, doctors are very anxious about anything that would damage their reputation in any way.  Being associated with potential criminal charges, even if one is not sent to prison, is a huge threat and definitely influences people in the way they manage consultations.  It means that instead of a doctor being comfortable and free in his or her discussion with somebody one is continually, in one's mind, trying to be guarded and careful about anything one might say that could possibly be interpreted as not being in keeping with the law.  Decriminalisation would take away that layer yet one still can have lots of ethical and clinical guidelines.  The Medical Council is still in a position to sanction doctors who have been found to have behaved inappropriately.  It should not mean that people think doctors will somehow behave badly if there is no criminal sanction.

As the Deputy said, this has been investigated by the HSE and a file was sent to the DPP and there has been no evidence of wrongdoing found.  I do not know that one can say we did anything wrong in this situation.

I spoke last week about Marie Stopes paying bonuses to staff members to encourage people to have abortions.  That is totally wrong.<\/p> <p>   The witness has talked about how a woman who travelled abroad for an abortion will not be able to bring her medical history with her.  Medical history is very important so that a doctor can treat a woman properly.  If she has any complications or problems, he knows exactly what he can do because he has the records.  If women who went to Irish Family Planning Association clinics followed the advice they got there and told doctors they had a miscarriage instead of an abortion it would mean giving false medical history and if any complications cropped up, doctors would not be able to treat them properly because they would not be aware they had had an abortion.  Given that medical history is very important, why were counsellors in Irish Family Planning Association clinics telling women they could give false information to their doctors.  How can the organisation tell us women's health is very important?  I am very disappointed.  People do not just make these things up.  People went in looking for advice from the services.

I think the Chair said she is \"indebted to Deputy Rabbitte\" for her comments about the non-appearance before the committee of certain pro-life invitees.  To judge by the letters sent in by two of them, they did not want to be used in a tokenistic way by a committee that had already made up its mind that the eighth amendment must be changed or removed.  That was a significant decision to take without hearing all the evidence.  The response of the invitees in question was very understandable.

In light of that, I want to go back to some of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  An expos&eacute; that was reported on in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>a few years ago was done by a group of women who had anecdotal or personal experience of having abortions or who knew women who subsequently came to regret their decisions and felt they had been badly and, in some ways, illegally advised by counselling agencies in receipt of funding from the State.  This is a very serious matter.  It was investigated by the Garda.  The evidence showed that women were told to hide their abortions from their own doctors on five occasions.  In four of those five cases, it was IFPA counsellors who told them to do so.  In one case, a woman was told that if complications arose after a surgical abortion in Britain, she needed to tell medical staff in hospitals that she had had a miscarriage.  Nothing was said to her about whether she would be criminalised.  There was no evidence that this would ever happen.  I think the strong understanding of people is that it would never happen.  She was simply told she needed to tell medical staff she had had a miscarriage, as opposed to an abortion.<\/p><p>The then Master of the Rotunda Hospital, Professor Sam Coulter-Smith, criticised the danger surrounding this type of advice.  He said that complications during an abortion procedure could result in perforation of the uterus, which could be life-threatening if not known to the woman's doctor.  I put it to the IFPA that this was the action of a rogue agency.  It did not just happen once; it happened on at least five occasions and the IFPA was involved on at least four of those.  Contrary to the implicit suggestion that the counsellor was an inexperienced person who was led into giving this advice, in the case of one Dundalk-based counsellor it was a very experienced person.  Does the IFPA deny that what was recorded took place?  Why has it never issued a statement acknowledging wrong practices within the agency or, indeed, proposing to make amends?  Was that not very reckless?<\/p><p>On page 4 of its presentation, the IFPA clearly criticises the importation of abortion pills as dangerous and describes this as &quot;an unregulated and unsafe practice&quot;.  On the occasion of the investigation to which I have refer, women were told at two IFPA clinics how to purchase and import illegal abortion pills by visiting a named website.  One counsellor advised a woman that she could have such pills posted to a post office box in Northern Ireland.  A counsellor at the Cork IFPA service who discussed the illegal importation of the abortion pill with a woman emphasised that the IFPA was not encouraging her to break the law or get into trouble while pointing out that this could be done.  The counsellor got the woman to write down the relevant information because he or she did not want to be arrested for providing it.  The counsellor was aware that this was not the kind of information he or she should be providing.  Is that not also the action of a rogue agency?<\/p><p>I will summarise my questions.  Does the IFPA acknowledge that there is evidence that some of its people have engaged in actions that were fatal for unborn children and had potentially dangerous consequences for women?  While this evidence was reported to the Garda and led to some commentary in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and at the Oireachtas health committee, the IFPA neither deigned to issue an explanation of past wrongdoing nor showed any desire to investigate or to get to best practice.  Does that not show how little the IFPA actually cares for women's health?  The report or investigation I have mentioned also found that Marie Stopes was criticised by IFPA counsellors, who advised people not to go to Marie Stopes services because they had received many complaints about them.  If the IFPA really cared about women's health, would it not have gone public about this matter rather than quietly advising people not to go to Marie Stopes?  Would this not have been seen as a public health and safety question?  I would be very grateful for answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04700","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Both Mr. Behan and Dr. Henchion may wish to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked and many statements have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>If a little bit of extra time is required, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G05000","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Many of the statements that have been made are absolutely incorrect.

The audit examined the evidence that we relied on for those protocols from a whole range of best practice models; the World Health Organization; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the International Planned Parenthood Federation; the Irish College of General Practitioners; the HSE itself; and the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.

The IFPA had no difficulty in co-operating with that process.  It took up quite a lot of IFPA and HSE staff time.  Following that process, four administrative recommendations were made to us.  We had no difficulty in complying with them.  Within days of receiving those recommendations, we changed our protocols in a manner that was satisfactory to the quality and patient safety directorate.  This is the type of stuff that the IFPA has been putting up with since the 1970s.  It does not deter us.  I do not know why Senator Mullen does it.  It does not really get him anywhere.

A view is sometimes put forward that there is a frivolous aspect to women who might be seeking abortion or that it is a form of family planning.  I am playing devil's advocate in this.

It is not only women, however.  Quite often families are involved in the decision, women and their partners, and they take into account issues relating to their children.  I have spoken to women who, very regretfully, decided to have an abortion because they already had two children with special needs and simply would not have been able to look after them properly if they continued with another pregnancy.  I have come across women who have made their decisions with great difficulty, but after giving them a great amount of thought.  They may feel, for example, that there is a very high risk of a problem occurring with their pregnancies by virtue of their age.  In every case, the women have considered the decision.  They have argued for and against it in their heads for quite a long time before making it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that so many of these women are not using contraception properly or not using reliable contraception at the time they become pregnant.  Quite separately from women who have had a crisis pregnancy or an abortion, I meet many women for emergency contraception or contraception consultations.  Sometimes I meet women for consultations that are totally unrelated to contraception and when I ask them what contraception they are using, they tell me that they are not using any even though they are of reproductive age.  The issue of why women are not using contraception or not using effective contraception is a huge issue which needs to be addressed.  I have given some of the possible reasons for that.  <\/p> <p>  This is not just to do with teenagers and young women.  This is to do with women of all ages having misconceptions about their fertility or simply taking chances, putting off issues of contraception and not doing anything about it.  We really need to address that.

The first is that the medication may not be what it is supposed to be.  That is particularly the case if ordered from a provider that is not reliable.  I have seen women who have taken medication they ordered online themselves and nothing has happened.  The did not have bleeding or pain or they had had very little bleeding.  It is clear that whatever they were given did not contain any active ingredients.  We have no idea of the conditions in which that sort of medication is being made.  It may not be safe.  It may contain ingredients which are not safe for people to take.  It is certainly misleading and it gives women the impression, particularly if they have a small amount of bleeding afterwards, that they may have ended their pregnancy when in fact they have not.  In the event of someone being at a later stage of gestation than she thought, there is a greater chance of the medication not working and, therefore, a greater chance that the pregnancy will continue.  It is dangerous to expose a pregnancy to some of those medications if it then continues.<\/p> <p>  There is not a huge number of complications in these cases, but there is one very simple thing about which I would be concerned when women are accessing pills online.  If anybody who has a miscarriage, abortion or full-term delivery is rhesus negative, which is a blood type, she needs to get anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent damage to any subsequent pregnancies.  These women are clearly not getting that because they are not seeing a health care provider.  My final concern, which I have already mentioned, is the fear that the small number of women who have excessive bleeding are delaying coming to see somebody because they are afraid of getting into trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Following on from that, if the medication is not what it is supposed to be, does it pose the prospect of later travel and an abortion being procured later as a consequence of that delay?

To follow on from some of Deputy Daly's questions on contraception, I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong but I believe they are saying that greater access to contraception leads to fewer unwanted pregnancies.  Can we sum it up like that?  I have tabled a parliamentary question on today's Order Paper, No. 76, which basically asks the Minister for Health the cost to the Exchequer of contraceptives over the past ten years.  I did not table the question just for the good of my health.  I intend to propose that all women in Ireland be provided with free contraception, in the same way as proposed by Deputy Daly, to whom I have spoken about it.  I worked in community pharmacy before and we had difficulty in accessing emergency contraception at the weekend and the Minister introduced a statutory instrument.  Based on what the witnesses have said today and the work which has already been done by members of the committee, it is a no-brainer for us to call for universal access to contraceptives for women in Ireland.<\/p><p>Dr. Henchion referred to long-acting, reversible contraceptives.  The cost of the Mirena coil allowed on the drug payment scheme is &euro;144, providing coverage for five years, give or take, which is &euro;2.40 per calendar month.  That is not a massive sum of money.  Dr. Henchion is talking about the outlay.  I have come across people who have put off having the relevant procedure for financial reasons.<br\/><br\/>We are discussing  socioeconomic reasons today but I want to move away from the economic element to the social one.  One of my sisters had babies in that wonderful hospital in Cork.  I was interested to see that domestic violence goes from one in eight in normal circumstances in Cork, or the regions served by Cork, to one in five when a woman is pregnant.  My understanding is that economic factors have no influence on this.  The committee needs to know that women are much more likely to suffer from domestic violence if they are pregnant.  I should not say that is not only in Cork.  However, the study was conducted in Cork and the surrounding region.  What emerged from it conjures up the idea that women with crisis pregnancies may be trapped in relationships where they are forced to become parents against their will.  Can Dr. Henchion tell me if there is any impediment to a woman's requesting a hysterectomy?  If I decided tomorrow that my periods were too heavy or too difficult and I was low in iron and wrecked all the time, would I have to go to a court to ask that my reproductive organs be removed?  Do I have to clear it with anyone other than my doctor?<br\/><br\/>Referring to something my Fine Gael colleague said, that we do not have any babies to adopt, are we moving into a situation reminiscent of <i>The Handmaid's Tale<\/i>, whereby women with crisis pregnancies will be detained, forced to become parents and used as a source of supply of babies for childless people?  That is up there with the most shocking thing I have heard today and I am hoping to God nobody forces me into that situation.  Good luck to them if they do.<br\/><br\/>I want to correct something that was said by the good Senator Mullen.  <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>did not carry out the investigation into the doctors.

There would be surgical sterilisation operations available to women where the tubes are tied or ligatured.  That is available but logistically it is not very practical because it takes probably over a year for a routine gynaecological appointment to come to the top of the list.  Then, having been seen, the woman may be rejected on the grounds of not enough children, too young or various matters like that.  The woman is then put on a second waiting list - to actually get the procedure done - if that is deemed to be suitable.  There are women who want a permanent method and do not want to have to keep on renewing contraceptive methods.   I would always say that I refer them but they need to do something else now because they will be waiting two to three years for that to become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does anybody intervene, apart from in the context of the conversation between the woman and her doctor to stop her having that procedure?

For a while it felt as if they were on trial.  It is an awful shame to sit on a committee like this, which should be about women and how women are affected, and have the conversation dragged away from that and off in another direction.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to ask have been answered but I would like to tease out some of the socioeconomic reasons.  As a recommendation, there is probably a lack of understanding of what that means.  Initially I recall celebrating this recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.  I received commentary to the effect that it referred to poverty and wanting to abort children born into poverty.  There was a real lack of understanding that this concerns women who are affected in some way by their socioeconomic circumstances and that covers many issues, including mental health, addiction and age.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to sit here every week and separate the political from the personal, particularly as a woman who has probably experienced many of the things we speak about every week.  I was a service user of the IFPA.  I had a crisis pregnancy and I ticked as many boxes as a woman possibly could at the age of 15.  I found the service amazing.  It was comforting and the counselling I received there was very good.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about representing women with crisis pregnancies who proceeded to have children.  I am one of those women and I represent them here.  However, this does not mean that I am of the view that women should not have a choice.  I was given that choice earlier.  This is not a question of the witnesses coming in here to promote abortion, which is how it is being sold.  The IFPA definitely did not sell abortion to me at the age of 15.  I want to put that on the record and to commend the organisation.  As a community worker who works with women in deprivation, I continued to refer women who found themselves in that situation to the IFPA and I would continue to do that, no matter what is said here today.<\/p> <p>  To tease out the socioeconomic circumstances, the witnesses have some of those reasons in the vignettes.  I want to capture today not the barrier to women travelling - because we know that the socioeconomic situation is a factor - but how we begin to create criteria that encompass everything that socioeconomic status can affect.  That exists in other countries.  What falls under it and how?  Is it impossible and should we just go for it without restriction?  If we do not have a ground for socioeconomic reasons should we increase the number of weeks for providing it without restriction because sometimes those socioeconomic factors might not come to light until later?<\/p> <p>  I probably have not been very clear.  It is difficult to separate the personal from the political when I sit in this room.  Perhaps we can speak more to the impact of socioeconomic status on women's decisions.  The witnesses referred to women's aspirations and, for example, a woman wanting to go college and being the first person in her family to do that.  Will people take seriously the fact that women seeking abortion are likely to talk about their own aspirations and what they want in terms of quality of life?  How do we capture that in a doctor's waiting room?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>There is a lot in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I do not think any of it made sense.

If somebody feels that in her particular set of circumstances she cannot continue with the pregnancy, we have to trust her.  In having a consultation with somebody, we have to trust that those appear to be real concerns and that is the decision the person has made.  Obviously, if somebody is not actually certain of what she wants to do, then it is not anybody's role to try to convince her to go in one direction or another.  The role of any consultation, any first contact, will be to identify those women who need more support with their decision and make sure that they get those supports, whether they are financial, practical or more counselling and more time.  That is really where the important thing comes in about identifying socioeconomic problems and making sure that those women get the resources so that socioeconomic factors do not necessarily have to be deciding factors in what they do about their crisis pregnancy.

We see the eighth amendment making no impact on the number of women travelling to the UK.  When we get to 2001 and 2002, however, we see a change, a reduction.  It is an interesting point.  Why have we got this reduction?  Why have we got this doubling of the figures in the 18 years after 1983 and then a reduction in the last 16 years that is almost consistent across all the years?

The service has been around a long time.  I used it in the 1980s during much darker days for women in terms of accessing reproductive health care.  I was afraid to go to my doctor to ask for a coil or the morning after pill and I shared such fear with many women of my generation because we were in those dark times during the 1980s.  If one could not afford a private clinic, the only place one could go was the Irish Family Planning Association and it continues to play that role.  I will never forget the helpless bewilderment on the faces of counsellors when I told them I wanted an abortion.  In those days they could not even give me information on how to go about that because it was before the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 and it was illegal to give me the phone number of an abortion clinic in Liverpool.  I had to get that number under my own steam.  I thank the doctors, counsellors and those who worked tirelessly for women over the past decades and provided those services throughout the country.  In many cases it was not just in respect of contraception but general sexual health.<\/p> <p>  As regards the socioeconomic point and the question of the increasing number of women who are in crisis pregnancies because of poverty, do the witnesses have any evidence that poverty impacts on the level of crisis pregnancy?  The lack of access to proper contraception such as the permanent reversible contraception of which the witness spoke is a contributory factor.  I think it important to repeat something Dr. Henchion said in her submission.  She said: \"I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception\".  Is it not a huge indictment of the services here that we are supposed to be concerned about the protection of life in our laws which say we are concerned about the foetus and the unborn yet socioeconomically we are condemning more women to crisis pregnancies because of the inaffordability of proper contraception?  Can the witnesses confirm if that is the case?<\/p> <p>  An alarming statement made by Dr. Henchion which flies in the face of what was said about Ireland being one of the safest countries in which to be pregnant is that the increased clandestine and illegal use of the abortion pill means more and more women are left without follow-up post-abortion care.  She also said that many of the women she sees do not come back to the IFPA for post-abortion care.  Perhaps she could explain why that is so.  I suspect it is related to the socioeconomic poverty reasons I have mentioned.  Are those who say this is the safest place in the world in which to be pregnant taking into account the IFPA statement which says that a substantial number of women are accessing illegal abortions through the abortion pill and, therefore, do not have follow-up care?  \"It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.\"  That is an extremely strong statement.  I would like the witnesses to expand on how we, as a society, are leaving ourselves and society as a whole but women in particular open to severe consequences through ignoring their reproductive health in this manner or making it illegal for them to take certain actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#M00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>One of the first things one has to do for a health measure to be widely adopted is to get rid of cost.  That is what we do with vaccination programmes.  One could point out that if people valued it enough they would still get it but if one wants everybody to do so, one must get rid of the cost.  That is what is done for public health issues.  If we want to tackle the issue of crisis pregnancy, contraception and sexual health education has to be looked at as a public health issue and money must be taken out of the equation in order that it cannot be a factor.<\/p> <p>  It is not enough to only take out the cost of contraception.  One needs to make people aware of the issues involved or they will not access contraceptive services in the first place.  That definitely links in to socioeconomic factors because, as I said, a girl who leaves school early may have missed out on contraceptive education at school because it might have been delivered too late.  A girl who does not attend school very frequently may not have received that education.  We need to address that issue and ensure we are looking at it as a public health measure.<\/p> <p>  There are many reasons why women do not come for post-abortion care.  It is a difficult question to answer because if they do not attend, I do not see them and, therefore, cannot answer completely for those who do not come.  Some women come to the IFPA and are very anxious about doing so.  They are anxious that they may have a complication or about being judged and the attitudes that people might have towards them and are at pains to try to justify their decision because they think others might feel abortion is only okay for some people.  Those are reasons that people might not want to come.  Because many women do not see a health care provider before they have an abortion, in order to do so afterwards they have to again find out where that service is and then go and tell their story all over again to a new person and that is a difficulty.  If they were going back to the place where they had the abortion, that would not be a deterrent.  Those are some of the reasons women do not attend for care.<\/p> <p>  The risk to a woman's life as a result of an illegal abortion using online medication is exceptionally low but that is not to say that women using such medication have a good health care experience.  There may be minor or low-level risks such as not getting their contraception or enduring a procedure that is painful, uncomfortable and frightening while being alone with absolutely no support and nowhere to which to turn and being worried that if something goes wrong they will be found out rather than get help.

Does she seek his counsel or advice?  Does he have a role in this decision or is he out of the equation?  If the woman in question is exceptionally young, would Dr. Henchion welcome engagement and seek involvement from her parents?<\/p> <p>  I am somewhat concerned about Dr. Henchion's statement that she has seen many women who have had illegal abortions performed.  I am not quite sure what her position is on that.  When a woman comes to Dr. Henchion and says she has had an illegal abortion - I would have the utmost sympathy for the woman - is it not illegal?  If something is illegal, it is illegal.  Does Dr. Henchion think it is incumbent on the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, to share that information or in any way refer it to a statutory body or State agency such as the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#N00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>On the question of whether we seek the involvement of the putative father in the case, the answer is \"No\", we do not.

We are probably only seeing a very tiny percentage of those women who are having illegal abortions, because they are reluctant to come and they will only come if there is a problem.  On the question of whether I would report those women, I do not.  I feel my primary concerns are their confidentiality and health and well-being.

They have an idea about where they want to go if they have made up their mind that they want to have an abortion.  They may have a question.  The other major shift we have seen is that the stigma is reducing, although it is still there and plays a huge part.  The woman coming to us now will probably have told more people now than the woman who came to us 20 years ago about her intention either to have an abortion or if she is coming back for post-abortion care having had an abortion.  We put this down to a breaking down of the stigma.  We see more of our clients now presenting with someone.

My name is Janice Donlon and I am the project manager for funded services with the Health Service Executive, HSE, sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  I am joined today by Helen Deely who is the head of the programme.  We have been asked to address the committee on the supports provided by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme and on the use of the abortion pill.<br\/><br\/>The information will be presented in two sections: first, I will outline supports provided by the programme to those experiencing a crisis pregnancy.  I will then talk about behavioural trends and research relating to crisis pregnancy including use of the abortion pill.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme is a national programme situated within the health and well-being division of the HSE.  The programme is mandated by a statutory instrument to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to provide support to those who have a crisis pregnancy.  Legislation defines crisis pregnancy as &quot;a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her&quot;.  The programme understands this definition to also include the experiences of those women for whom a planned or desired pregnancy develops into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances.<br\/><br\/>A pregnancy may be considered a crisis for several reasons.  Crisis pregnancy can be related to a perceived inability to cope with a child at that time; being too young or too old; not being in a financial position to support a child; and the potential impact that becoming a parent at that point might have on their education, training or employment.  Research finds that approximately one third of women who have been pregnant and one fifth of men who have experienced a pregnancy in their lifetime have experienced a crisis pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>The programme funds 15 individual crisis pregnancy counselling services which operate out of 40 plus locations nationwide to provide free crisis pregnancy counselling.  Details of these crisis pregnancy counselling services can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>.  Crisis pregnancy counselling and information on all three options: parenting, adoption and abortion are provided under the legal framework of Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, also known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Crisis pregnancy counselling services are funded by the HSE under detailed governance arrangements and underpinned by a quality framework including access to supervision and training supports and guidelines and protocols to support services and their staff working in this complex area.<br\/><br\/>Counselling for a woman involves creating space to allow her to discuss and reflect on her crisis pregnancy and to support her through the decision-making process.  While many women experiencing a crisis pregnancy resolve the crisis for themselves, or have support from family and friends, research finds that they see a clear role for a counsellor.  The importance of a supportive listener and non-judgmental support allows them to consider how the pregnancy impacts on their lives.  It is the counsellor's role to provide space and time to facilitate women to work through difficult conflicts in a non-judgmental and non-directive manner.<br\/><br\/>During a counselling session the client may request information on the options available to her.  Any woman considering parenting a child will be made aware of the various organisations and community support groups that offer information and support in relation to parenting, either alone or as a couple.  Many of these organisations are also funded through the programme.  Such organisations and groups have detailed user-friendly booklets touching on many issues of parenting, including information on rights and entitlements and accessing support services.<br\/><br\/>In respect of adoption crisis pregnancy counsellors are able to provide a client with some of the basic principles surrounding the process of adoption and the rights of birth parents and adoptive parents.  However, if a woman chooses adoption as an option she will be appropriately counselled and advised at all stages of the adoption process by an adoption social worker, either with the Tusla adoption service or an accredited body.<br\/><br\/>If, after appropriate counselling on all options, a woman makes the decision to terminate her pregnancy she should be given as much information as is necessary.  Information about abortion services in other countries may be made available under certain conditions.  The law on the subject was passed in 1995 and is usually known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals.  Information on how to access abortion services, including names and addresses of clinics can be provided as can information on the types of procedure that may be available to her.  Crisis pregnancy counsellors are not medically trained and any specific medical questions are referred to the woman's general practitioner.<br\/><br\/>All information should be provided in a manner that is accurate, unbiased, impartial and in accordance with the law.  This is necessary to allow the woman to make an informed decision as to the most appropriate course of action for her.  Information may be given in different formats, including written material which the client can take home with her.<br\/><br\/>The numbers of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services has fallen significantly in recent years.  In 2010 4,662 individual clients attended for crisis pregnancy counselling, by 2016 that number had fallen to 2,570.  The majority of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services are between the ages of 25 and 34.<\/p><p>It is recognised by us and the services that in the 20 years since the commencement of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act,1995 there have been many developments in technology, including access to the Internet.  Many women are now bypassing crisis pregnancy counselling services and accessing information on abortion services directly from the Internet.  While the numbers attending services are decreasing, counselling services report that those attending services are presenting with more complex and multiple issues.  The challenge for the programme and the counselling services is to ensure that women in most need of crisis pregnancy services and supports feel that the services are relevant to them and will meet their needs.<br\/><br\/>Many of the counselling services funded by the programme also support women and their partners through the diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality or life limiting condition.  Additional training and support has been provided to these services to ensure they are able to respond to the needs of this client group.  Counselling services have forged links with maternity units and have the expertise and the capacity to support women and their partners through this difficult time.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the issue of crisis pregnancy agencies, which are not funded by the State.  Some organisations that advertise as crisis pregnancy counselling services have a hidden agenda.  The service they provide is designed to influence the choice a woman makes and to pressure a woman into doing something she may not want to do.  Once these agencies have been contacted by a client they can seek to delay the counselling process and, in certain cases, show clients inappropriate images or use other tactics in an effort to influence their decision.  These organisations are not State funded and women are advised to find out as much information as possible about a pregnancy service before they make an appointment.  All HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme funded services are advertised on <i>positiveoptions.ie<\/i>and will provide non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.<br\/><br\/>Post-abortion services that are available include post-abortion counselling provided by the same funded services which provide crisis pregnancy counselling,.  Details of these post-abortion counselling providers are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Information on the availability of free post-abortion counselling in Ireland is also provided by abortion clinics in the UK and the Netherlands.  The programme links with abortion providers to ensure the information is made available to women who have travelled from Ireland.  Post-abortion psychological support allows a woman a safe space in which to explore and articulate her feelings, whatever they may be, towards the decision made and perhaps the experience of the abortion itself.  A client may require a number of counselling sessions post abortion and the counsellor is available to support the woman depending on her individual needs.  A woman may attend for post-abortion counselling shortly after her abortion or she may attend at a later stage if issues emerge related to other life events.  The number of women who access post-abortion counselling has remained steady over the last number of years and in 2016 a total of 1,377 clients were seen for post-abortion counselling.<br\/><br\/>A post-abortion medical check-up is also available for women to ensure they have fully recovered from their procedure.  A post-abortion check-up normally involves a blood pressure check and an examination of the woman's abdomen.  The doctor will confirm that the pregnancy has ended, check that bleeding pattern is normal and there is no infection and will assist the client with their contraceptive needs.<br\/><br\/>A number of the services funded to provide crisis pregnancy and post-abortion counselling services also provide free post-abortion medical check-ups.  The details of these services are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie<\/i>.  Attendance at the medical checkup also allows an opportunity for the doctor to refer the women to post-abortion counselling if such a referral appears beneficial.  The numbers attending these services is low; in 2016, a total of 442 women attended medical check-ups funded by the programme.  Women may attend their GP on their return if required or, depending on the type of procedure they have undergone, may not require a post-abortion medical check-up, for example with early medical abortion.<br\/><br\/>I shall now address some behavioural trends and the research relating to crisis pregnancy, including use of the abortion pill.  As a core function of its work, the programme monitors behavioural trends relating to its mandates, using a range of tools and indicators including general population surveys and statistics.  Research informs us that crisis pregnancies happen to women and their partners from all different ages, socio-economic backgrounds and with different relationship statuses.  The majority are married, engaged or in steady relationships when the crisis pregnancy occurs.  The most common reasons the pregnancy is seen as a crisis is because it was not planned or the woman and her partner consider themselves too young.  The average age at which a crisis pregnancy occurs is stable at 24 years for women and 25 years for men.<br\/><br\/>When we consider the outcomes of crisis pregnancy we can see that parenting is by far the most common outcome for those who experience a crisis pregnancy.  A survey of the general population found that when asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy 73% of women reported that they chose to parent.  In the same general population survey, 2% of those asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy reported that they chose adoption.  Traditionally in Ireland adoption was a common response for women experiencing a crisis pregnancy; however, the number of women placing their babies for adoption has decreased significantly in recent decades.  A figure of 24% of women in the same general population survey who reported experience of a crisis pregnancy reported that they chose to have an abortion following their most recent crisis pregnancy. <br\/><br\/>With regard to abortions in other jurisdictions it is well documented that many women travel from Ireland to other countries to access legal abortion services.  The programme analyses data collated by the Department of Health in the UK and the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands on the number of women travelling to those countries from Ireland for an abortion on an annual basis.  In the majority of cases, women travelling from Ireland for an abortion travel to England.  In 2016, a total of 3,265 women gave Irish addresses at UK abortion services, representing a rate of 3.2 per 1,000 women.  There has been a gradual decline in the number of women availing of abortion services in the UK since 2001.  In that year there were 6,673 abortions to women from Ireland in UK abortion clinics, representing a rate of 7.5 per 1,000 women.  The Ministry of Health in the Netherlands has collated data on women providing Irish addresses in Dutch abortion clinics since 2010.  Prior to 2010, the programme linked directly with the main abortion service providers in the Netherlands to establish the number of women providing Irish addresses there.  In 2015, 34 women were recorded to have provided Irish addresses in abortion clinics in the Netherlands.  These figures have significantly declined since their peak in 2006 when the number was 461.  The Netherlands has emerged as the only other jurisdiction to which women from Ireland have been travelling for abortion procedures in any significant numbers.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the numbers of abortions in Ireland under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  The Act defines the circumstances within which abortion in Ireland can be legally performed.  The total number of abortions carried out in accordance with this Act in 2016 was 25.  There were 26 in each of the years 2014 and 2015, with 2014 being the first year in which data was reported.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of abortion pills, they are designed to induce an abortion for a woman who is less than nine weeks pregnant.  Abortion pills are used by abortion providers in medically supervised clinics in countries where abortion is legal.  These are referred to as medical abortions.  The programme is aware that some women are accessing abortion pills in Ireland from international online providers.  In order to try to understand the incidence of this, the programme set up a reporting relationship with the Health Products Regulatory Authority in relation to the number of abortion pills seized by customs officers annually.  The programme has provided training and support to all funded services on this emerging issue.  All services have developed protocols in this area and training manuals and online resources have been updated with relevant information.<br\/><br\/>The reasons women may be accessing abortion pills online are cost and access.  For women who have made the decision to terminate a pregnancy, the cost associated with travelling from Ireland to another country for a medically supervised termination is high.  Research finds that higher earning women are more likely to travel to other countries for abortions over their lower earning counterparts.  Until recently it was difficult to make an assessment of the level to which this practice is occurring as limited information was available.  Recently published research suggests that more women are contacting online providers of abortion pills annually and becoming more aware about the availability of these drugs online.  As the committee has been informed by a previous witness Dr. Abigail Aiken, her study found that over the period January 2010 to December 2016 the number of women from Ireland who contacted an online provider of abortion pills tripled.  In 2010 there were 548 online consultations completed by women from the island of Ireland.  In 2016, the number had increased to 1,748.<br\/><br\/>Another research article, published by the same authors in 2017, reports on the experiences of women following taking the abortion pill in Ireland.  The study reports on 1,000 women who underwent self-sourced medical abortion from the online service.  The study reports that while the vast majority of women did not need to contact medical services following taking the abortion pill at home, approximately one in ten - 9.3% - reported to the online provider that they were experiencing a symptom for which they were advised to seek medical advice and the vast majority of these women sought medical advice as advised.<\/p><p>The programme has identified one other main provider of the abortion pill and has sought similar information from this provider for a more accurate assessment of the trend.<br\/><br\/>If a woman takes an abortion pill and has prolonged heavy bleeding, bad pain, fainting or other complications we strongly encourage that she attends an emergency department or GP straight away.  If a woman is concerned about her health following taking an abortion pill, we would encourage her to attend a free post-abortion medical check-up funded by the HSE.  A list of these services is available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie. <\/i><br\/><br\/>I thank the committee members for their attention.

I thank Ms Donlon for coming to the committee today and for her presentation.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the HSE crisis pregnancy website.  It states that it has three mandates, one of which is \"A reduction in the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services and support which make other options more attractive\".  I am a little bit confused because page 2 of Ms Donlon's presentation says that the HSE services are to be provided in a non-directive, non-judgmental and client-centred manner.  If a woman feels that her needs are best met by an abortion what are these other options that the HSE mentions on its website? Is this a case of directive counselling to the woman to continue with the pregnancy or are there other options we are unaware of?  Perhaps Ms Donlon will elaborate on these because it appears to me to be contradictory with regard to the HSE website and what Ms Donlon has said here.  I can see only two options available for women in those circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for the questions.  The mandates certainly set out the exploring of other options.  The way that we interpret the mandates, as set out by the crisis pregnancy legislation, is by providing non-directive and non-judgmental counselling.  That is set out in the law also in respect of providing that level of support for women.  We feel that counselling provides the space and the time for women to explore all of their options in a safe, secure and non-judgmental manner.  We absolutely are not directive in any of our instructions around our mandates and we absolutely support the provision on non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.  Counselling allows women the space and time to discuss all of her options, and to explore how each of the options may impact on her life.  If the woman wants to explore the option of parenting she is given enough support and information to consider that and how it would impact on her individual set of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The programme has provided funding over the years to other organisations to provide supports to those who choose to parent.  A number of the organisations we fund provide support and training to one parent families and additional supports in that area.  Equally, we provide funding to a crisis pregnancy counselling service that has expertise in adoption.  If a woman chooses to explore that option she is given enough information to be able to make that decision.  Our mandates allow us to ensure that women are directed towards counselling that is non-judgmental and non-directive.  This is what we fund in counselling services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donlon for that answer.

Some women do and our services are available to those women.

She cannot believe that she is pregnant and the counsellor's role is to support the woman through that crisis, to support her through the decisions she will make and support her in teasing out how those decisions will impact on her life.

Let me put it this way: we operate within a constitutional framework where the unborn baby is another person to be protected by Irish law, the second human being involved in the equation.  In other areas of our culture, we have very good, proactive and State-funded activity designed to discourage behaviours that might be harmful to individuals themselves or to a third party.  I am thinking about anti-drink and anti-smoking campaigns, drink-driving, and, increasingly, anti-obesity.  These campaigns are publicly funded.  One would not so much describe them as directive and judgmental because they do not judge the people and nor do they require or coerce certain kinds of behaviour, but they do clearly encourage or indeed discourage certain behaviours.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect Ms Donlon to comment on the anomaly, because that would bring her into the realm of policy, but it seems anomalous that, on the one hand, we can encourage certain kinds of behaviours for the sake of protecting an individual, or a third party in the case of drinking and driving and so on, but that when it comes to the protection of the unborn and how that intersects with Ms Donlon's work, it seems to me that the positive options notion sums up her activity, which is to say that as long as the information is procured, supplied and accurately provided when requested, Ms Donlon's job is done.  Is this because the programme sees itself as being curbed by legislation that there is not something more proactive done given our constitutional position, which one would understand ought to tend the State towards protecting the unborn?  I am asking about things like recommending adoption or requiring that State-funded agencies propose or speak positively of adoption as an alternative.<\/p> <p>  I am also talking about things like informed consent.  We had a hearing last week in which it was not effectively accepted but it was certainly not contradicted, that there is no evidence linking abortion with increased mental health outcomes, yet mental health is what is on the Statute Book in Britain and it is what has opened up a large number of abortions.  Mental health was also cited by the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, here earlier.  Does the HSE crisis pregnancy programme require, as a matter of informed consent, that counsellors draw a woman's attention to the possibility that if she had, for example, a previous mental health history she might be at risk of adverse mental health sequelae in the context of abortion?  This is no more and no less than the precise truth.<\/p> <p>  Take the question of ultrasound.  I am not asking Ms Donlon whether it ought to be required that a woman see an ultrasound, but ought it be required of counsellors that they offer that in a respectful way and in a way that always respects a woman's right to refuse, but also in a way that allows the provision and sharing of full information, all of which might act to encourage the life-giving choice at the end of the day?  Does Ms Donlon see that as outside of her mandate?  Would it require a change of law in her view for public policy to go down that road in the light of what the eighth amendment currently states as a matter of public policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#W01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen has spoken for five minutes now.

She is seen in a non-judgmental and non-directive way in relation to the provision of information.  That is how the counselling services operate, and it is good counselling practice to operate in that manner.  The individual is coming to the counsellor in a crisis.

When listening to Ms Donlon's presentation, I reflected on the fact that it has been many years since I marched with my mother on the streets of Dublin for the right to information.  I said to my mother at the time, \"This is ridiculous.  This is only information.\"  Of course, now there is a raft of information available, not only from the HSE.  Ms Donlon states that there has been a gradual decline in the numbers travelling and a gradual increase in the number of women who are accessing abortion pills online.  Presumably, given that the one is going down and the other is going up, we can say that the number of women accessing abortion care is remaining relatively steady, as is the number availing of counselling, 442, which, as Ms Donlon said, is very low.  There is an great deal of information out there, which can be accessed with a few clicks of a mouse.  Women know that the services are available, that the aftercare and emotional support are there, should they require them.  However, the figure for those availing of counselling remains consistently low.  Would it be true to say that this would indicate that women are happy with their choice and have no need for follow-up counselling?  Perhaps Ms Donlon could elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  On the rogue agencies, I am thinking particularly about work done by the journalist Ellen Coyne on those agencies that will tell women that if they have had abortions, they are at greater risk of breast cancer and other nonsense of that nature which we know has no basis in medicine.  Ms Donlon says those agencies target women in crisis pregnancy.  Could she elaborate on how that is done?  I echo what my colleague said - we do not often find ourselves agreeing with Fine Gael but we will say so when it happens.  I welcome the moves by the Minister to regulate these agencies, particularly those which were highlighted in the reports and which are giving that sort of information to women who, in some instances, are frightened.  How is that targeting happening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01000","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I might take that question first.  What we have seen and through our communications unit in the HSE, is that women seek information about abortion services and crisis pregnancies primarily online, through a Google search.  These rogue, disingenuous agencies are targeting women by increasing their spend on paid AdWords on Google.  We in the HSE try to combat that by outbidding them in terms of search words.  It is a constant battle.  We are trying to ensure that our information about the funded services, the Positive Options information, comes up first on Google searches and that these rogue services are not the first result that somebody will see.  I think in the past they may have taken out advertisements in the Golden Pages and the agency and the programme would have tried to combat that by taking out bigger advertisements.  It is a matter of trying to keep up with them at all times.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that they regularly change their names.  While we may have been aware of some of them in the past, they have now changed their name so it is very hard to track.  They change their locations.  It is very difficult to deter women from a certain agency when we do not know where it is actually located.  It is incredibly difficult and the services we fund, which see these women after they have been through traumatic experiences, would certainly let us know that women are traumatised.  They do not want to go through a complaints procedure against these organisations.  We have a complaints mechanism in place if a woman wants to go ahead in that regard.  Often, the woman just wants to get the non-directive, non-judgmental counselling in order to get through her crisis and does not want to revisit a very difficult time.<\/p> <p>  We would absolutely welcome the regulation of counselling services.  The counselling services we fund would also welcome it.  Counselling in general is not regulated.  There is no regulatory body over it.  In the absence of regulation, what the HSE has done in terms of the crisis pregnancy counselling services is to provide training and support for counsellors in a non-regulated environment.  We have robust service arrangements with all of the organisations and put funding into training for individual counsellors.  They have access to supervision as well in terms of their counselling practice.  In order to level the playing field in terms of transparency of crisis pregnancy services, I think regulation certainly will help.<\/p> <p>  What was the Deputy's previous question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>It was to do with the numbers.

We are discussing socioeconomic status and disadvantage in the context of women and the choices they make.  Looking at the Positive Options website and the clinics that provide counselling services - which the HSE funds - I counted 32 or 33 locations but Ms Donlon says it is 40 and I accept that.  I did not look at the geographical spread in respect of them but I want to make a point about access to full information for all women across all centres in Ireland.  Outside of the urban centres, it might be more difficult for women to access a crisis pregnancy counselling service.  Would Ms Donlon comment on that?  It makes it more difficult and therefore the question of socioeconomic and economic disadvantage applies very much more for people who are not near an urban centre where they have choices in the type of counselling received.<\/p><p> My second question is on the list of agencies under Positive Options, approximately one third of which are run by Anew and Cura.  On their websites, both organisations state that they do not provide contact details for abortion clinics or abortion information services, but they will discuss.  It was stated here that the legal framework for providing information on abortion requires that individuals must be given access to the information.  If the only resource available to a poor woman is provided by Anew or Cura, which will not discuss abortion, why are they funded by the crisis pregnancy programme to provide one third of counselling services while failing to give women full access to all of the options they have?  Does it not further disadvantage women who are socially and economically in a bottom bracket?  While Anew or Cura will not provide the information women need on abortion, they will provide the name of a doctor or other service they can attend.  Does it not compound their disadvantage and possibly even the delay in procuring an abortion?  Women need and want to have access to abortion as early as possible but this seems to be an anomaly.  Why does a State agency such as the crisis pregnancy programme fund services which will not provide the full information to women?  They state on their website that they will discuss but not provide the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We fund 15 services providing crisis pregnancy counselling, two of which, the Deputy is right to state, do not provide, due to their ethos, information on names and addresses of abortion clinics outside Ireland.

Also, as the Deputy has seen from their websites, the information is very clearly accessible as to what they will or will not provide.  As such, the client is made aware before she attends whether she will be provided with information on abortion services.  There is an element of choice for some women of attending a service that is not going to provide the information, or choosing another service.  They also have in place, as stated in their service arrangements with the HSE, robust referral procedures so that, if a woman they are counselling seeks information on abortion and wants the names and addresses of clinics, she can be referred to her GP or another service provider.<\/p> <p>  The counselling services certainly report to us that they will support women through the option of abortion.  The ethos of their services does not allow them to provide the names and addresses of the clinics.  Women attend crisis pregnancy counselling for a number of reasons and make decisions on their choices around their crisis pregnancies.  As our research shows, 73% of women choose to parent and many of these organisations support women through that parenting.  Even after the baby is born, they assist them with supports for new mothers.  Certainly, there is a role for the services in that regard.

Many of the questions I had have been answered so I have only two brief questions.  I apologise for interrupting Deputy Fitzpatrick earlier on but I think it is a point that is worth noting.  I probably should have waited my turn.  In respect of adoption and whether it is decreasing or not, when we are having any conversation about women and the choices they have made, we need to look at it in the context of our history, the number of women we locked away and put in mother and baby homes and the number of illegal adoptions that took place in this country.  If the research is not there, I am sure it would factor in along the way if research was ever done.  It is important to say this because I do not think any of us would ever want to advocate that we want to go back to those figures.  It just involves being mindful of those women and the fact that they probably would have chosen to rear their children had they been given the support to do so.  That was the point I was trying to make.<\/p> <p>  In respect of socio-economic matters, I know from throughout my time supporting mothers who already have children, particularly if they are at risk of homelessness or are in addiction, that they are always very cautious of seeking help, particularly from State bodies.  There is some distrust there sometimes.  If somebody is experiencing addiction, how does the counselling operate in this scenarios?  Women are sometimes petrified of being judged as mothers.  They are worried that the children they already have might be taken off them if they raise the reason that a pregnancy is such a crisis.  How do the witnesses deal with that and have they come up against it?  Is there a cohort of women who do not access services because it is a State organisation?  How can we address that?  A point was made that socio-economic inequality exists in respect of being able to travel for abortion with poorer women being more likely to turn to the abortion pill.

The options are more limited for those with lower financial means, those in situations involving domestic violence and those facing a multitude of situations whereby they are unable to make the choices their counterparts with financial means are able to make.  If we take the example of asylum seekers in particular, they are restricted in terms of their economic and social ability and the procedure they must go through should they choose the option of abortion in terms of travelling outside the State for an abortion.  They can be insurmountable to many women in terms of going through with the option they have chosen so there are a range of additional issues that influence a woman's ability to make a decision and follow through with that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Some research has been done on adoption.  The biggest contributor to the fall in adoption rates was when the State introduced payments to women who were initially called unmarried mothers that became payments which allowed people to parent alone so that women did not have to continue with a pregnancy and then give their children up, but had the right to raise their own children and had the economic basis to do so.  The evidence would support that view.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  One of the excellent parts of today's discussion has been the highlighting of the rogue agencies that are out there and the imperative on us as legislators to deal with that.  It relates to the point made by Niall Behan earlier than they are the ones that are not regulated.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how to react to this presentation because I am torn, on the one hand, by trying to get the information out there that despite criminalisation, there are State-provided services for people with crisis pregnancies before and after an abortion which women in Ireland might need tonight.  That is not well known so that is a message we need to get out.  However, on the other hand, is it not an indication of our utter sickening and depressing hypocrisy that we dance around this issue, provide State services, give a constitutional right to access a service in another state, even send the leaflets over and look after women when they come back, but we have no abortion in Ireland?  That is demoralising.  The witnesses are the ones who are implementing that farce.<\/p><p>I do not know if they can comment on it.  I am trying to address the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act and the difficulties it causes.  We have had a lot of testimony about the break in the continuum of care.  Have the HSE's service providers or the agencies it funds highlighted any particular problems?  I am thinking of the comments made by the IFPA, in particular, about deaf women.  Somebody might be given information by a service but how does a deaf person ring a clinic in England and make the appointment?  Is that not a double discriminator?  How would that be addressed?  What are the problems in terms of that legislation?  Other contributors have said contraceptive prevalence is actually the key determinant of lowering abortion rates.  Deputy O'Connell made a point earlier about universal access to contraception.  Is that something the HSE has done research on or costed?  It would be of huge benefit to people.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act.  We acknowledged in the presentation that the Act is outdated given the current technology available to people and the access to information.  That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect the services report to us is that clients are often very surprised that when they attend a counselling service they can be given a list of names and addresses but they cannot be advised on which service might be best for them.  They cannot be referred to a service.  Their GP cannot refer them to a service and they are left alone with their list of services to contact and have to make the arrangements themselves.  The counsellor cannot support them through that element of the decision.  That is more difficult for some women than for others.  It has been highlighted that women with additional needs or financial difficulties are presented with more challenges in making those arrangements and carrying out their decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I can give the committee some statistics on contraception from the ICCP study from 2003 to 2010.  It tells us that even though older age groups are less likely to use contraceptives consistently every time they have sex, there is an increase in contraceptive use across all age groups.  Condom use increased from 57% in 2003 to 62% in 2010.  Use of the pill increased from 39% to 43% in those years.  There was an increase in IUDs from 6% to 11%.  Consistent use of contraception is lower in the older age group.  That has to do with the fact that sometimes women do not believe they are fertile or are ambivalent towards becoming pregnant or would not view an unplanned pregnancy as a crisis.  Increasing access to contraception outside of medical card holders would be a policy decision.  There would need to be information and education campaigns on it in terms of consistent and proper use of contraceptives.  In our programme, we run campaigns to promote consistent use of contraceptives.  We fund the ICGP to claim for long-acting reversible contraceptives, LARC.  We also fund a national condom distribution service that distributes condoms to groups working with those at risk of HIV or STIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Deely"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them.

It was a robust audit on policies, procedures, guidelines and protocols.  It involved in-depth interviews with staff members.  The audit made 11 recommendations, all of which have been fully implemented.  The majority of those recommendations were around improving the policies and procedures that were available in the counselling services.  We and the HSE took the broad view that we were here to support the services in terms of our funding and we supported them through additional training, updating our practice guide, our training manual and by helping them to improve their policies and procedures where there was a lack of available information highlighted by the audit.  We also implemented a quality framework with all services.  All services are signed up to a quality framework that assesses against national standards for crisis pregnancy counselling.

The Bill had been agreed on Committee Stage previously but following the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to consult with stakeholders on the provisions in the Bill and the rationale for the approach to the development of technological universities.  As part of that process a clarification document was subsequently agreed between the Department, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the Technological Higher Education Association.  TUI members voted to accept the agreement in June 2017 and suspended its industrial action in relation to the development of the technological universities.  A clarification document was also provided to IMPACT as part of this process.  The establishment of the technological universities will strengthen the skills, research and innovation capacity in the regions and support economic and social development.<\/p>  <p>  Before we discuss the amendments circulated for today I would like to notify the committee that I am also finalising additional amendments which I propose to table on Report Stage.

These regional institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions.

For the main part, they have intimated consortia that they would like to be in.  They are not going alone without any support.  Even yesterday, I announced a budget.  They had a budget last year.  There will be budgets built in to support the formation of the technological universities, TUs, throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  I have met many of the institutes of technology, IoTs, and their management.  <\/p>  <p>               Of course, there are questions.  This is a whole new merger and project.  Of course, there are many questions to be answered and solutions to be found and ironed out when a merger happens.  Deputy Troy asked specifically about Athlone.  It is clearly Government policy to consolidate institutes of technologies in a technological universities sector.  We will be building scale and capacity to make it attractive for students and staff in the regions where the technological universities are located.  Deputy Troy mentioned to me often when I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as did others, that it is very important to have skills and students in the regions.  That is one of the reasons we are strongly working to ensure students have opportunities to gain a technological university education within their region instead of having to move from the places they reside to a certain city and never going back.  We believe it will really strengthen the sector by creating universities.  We were advised by the OECD in 2004 as well as in the Hunt report about maintaining the binary divide.  We are seeking to ensure that consolidated institutes of technology bring students together and create strong universities.  We would have a critical mass of students and lecturers in an area.  That will be an add-on for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#C02300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Chairman giving me the opportunity to speak as I am not a member.  I have no intention of hogging the committee's meeting this evening.  The Minister of State referenced the Hunt report and another report, both of which were available prior to the negotiations for the programme for Government.  What I read out at the outset was a clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the mandatory need for a merger.  The Minister of State has reiterated in her feedback to me that this is no longer going to be honoured.  That is a straight question.  Is the Government rowing back on the commitment given in the programme for Government?  That is my first question.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that there is an urgent need to advance this critical legislation.  That the first amendment is to change its date from 2015 to 2017 indicates the length of time this has been ongoing.  I do not want it to get out there that I am trying to say, \"Athlone deserves it\".  It is up to Athlone or any other institute of technology to make its case based on the required areas of research and the level of doctoral or equivalent training among its teaching staff.  If an institute does not meet the high test set down, it will not be able to apply for university status.  If it does meet that, however, it should not be prevented.  I am making the case strongly because this was inserted in the programme for Government with Athlone Institute of Technology in mind.  Given its location, there are no nearby institutes with which it can merge.  The only benefit of a merger for Athlone would simply relate to scale and the number of pupils.  It would have nothing to do with the quality of the education being provided.

I have visited it not only as the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, but also in my last role.  In any of the messages I got from industries and businesses that opened in and around Athlone, Roscommon or Mullingar in particular, I heard the highest of praise for Athlone Institute of Technology, so I am a huge fan of AIT.

TU4Dublin will be 27,880 students; Munster TU, approximately 13,495: the Connacht-Ulster technological university alliance, 15,910; and TU south east, 14,612.  We believe having a critical mass is really important.  According to the figures for Athlone IT that I have before me, there was a student cohort of 4,890 in 2015-16, while Dundalk's was 4,999.  Our plan is to put the colleges and ITs together and create a critical mass and a choice for students in order that they can go from level 6 right up to doctorate level if they so wish.  As I said, at any stage single ITs can apply for technological university recognition, but they must be a consortium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#H00900","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":638,"content":"<p>This is very important.  Deputy Byrne asked the Minister of State earlier - and I would like it confirmed - whether the Government is actually committing to the retention of all the institutes of technology and the campuses in the diverse locations in which they exist around the country.  For instance, in Blanchardstown, and similarly in Tallaght, the student population is relatively small compared to the mass of DIT.  Many institutions are small but absolutely vital in terms of third level educational access for the people who live in the catchment areas.  For instance, Blanchardstown attracts not just, as one might expect, a significant number of students from the north west of Dublin, but also a very significant number of students from Meath, and that has always been the case.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that the campuses will remain and that there will not be another agenda of slimming down the institutions as a consequence of the merger.  This is a legitimate issue for local areas where, particularly if they are trying to attract foreign direct investment, having an institute of technology or being part in the future of a technological university is a really significant and important draw when trying to attract investment to the area.  <\/p>  <p>               The reason IBM came to west Dublin in the early 1990s was because people like me were campaigning to have an institute of technology, which did happen.

Committee members have raised good issues, and perhaps there is something to which we could all agree on Report Stage that could be drafted by the Government.  This is what I suggest.  Deputies Martin and Funchion have raised issues.  It is not a function of a technological university in this section to promote gender equity, for example.  I know there is provision regarding gender equality slightly further on.  As far as I know, it is a function of the DIT legislation that gender equity is promoted.  Perhaps someone can highlight it if I am wrong and I would be delighted to hear it.  It is something that has to be included.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge emphasis, and perhaps it is proper emphasis, on business and enterprise and developing an entrepreneurial culture, but there are many courses which do not relate to business and enterprise and a lot of academic disciplines that do not, such as social care, social work and education.  There are many areas.  I am thinking in particular about art and design also.  As far as I know, the institute of art and design would qualify under this legislation to seek to be part of a consortium.  There is art for art's sake, and design for design's sake and they are very important.  They should not necessarily have to be about the needs of business.  There is also culture agus an Gaeilge freisin.  Some of this can be part of a strategic plan, but we need to give more of an emphasis.  The cultural and social development of the State is mentioned, but business and enterprise are emphasised and they seem to be what hits one and what comes out.<\/p>  <p>  There is another amendment in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Lawless.  My understanding of his proposal, and he is our science spokesperson, is there such a thing as science discovery for the sake of science discovery.  It might not necessarily be directly relevant to a local employer in Blanchardstown but it could benefit the State hugely.  <\/p>  <p>                 I have a slight concern with the reference to the community in the region.  I spoke to the officials and they helpfully advised that this wording came from the Parliamentary Counsel.  There seems to be many communities in the regions that these institutions are serving.  That relates to amendment No. 29.  I urge the Government to reconsider that.  The purpose of Committee Stage is for us to go through the Bill line by line but it would be helpful for the Government to at least consider the points we are making and come forward with an amendment on Report Stage which we could hopefully all buy into.  Issues have been raised and the legislation has been lying around, as it were, for quite some time.  There are many functions of a technological university that are not listed or emphasised.

The principle of academic freedom is a defining characteristic of high-quality higher education and research across the world.  The Bill rightly ensures academic freedom will apply in technological universities in the same manner as it applies in universities.  However, it is understood internationally that academic freedom applies to the academic staff of higher education institutions.  Both this and the Universities Act 1997 reflect that understanding.  Extending academic freedom to students would put technological universities in a different position from their peers, both within the State and internationally.  It is believed this would not be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the whole doctrine of academic freedom is based on protecting the security of employment of academics&rsquo; tenure.  As students are not employees, their time in a higher education institution is, by definition, limited.  There are appropriate policies in place in institutions to protect students.  There are separate policies and procedures which govern students&rsquo; rights to expression and to offer them protection in this regard.  This includes the right of free expression.  Any claim that this right is being restricted or the fear that voicing a contrarian opinion would invite academic retribution can be better challenged through the existing charters and policies which set out a detailed process for consideration and redress where necessary.  Such policies and processes have already been agreed with student representatives at local level and have been adopted formally by each of the academic councils.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 54 relates to the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff of a technological university.  This is drafted in accordance with similar provisions which apply to universities, institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology under the relevant legislation.  It provides that a technological university may suspend or dismiss a member of staff only in accordance with procedures established, following consultation with the relevant trade unions and staff associations.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of amendments Nos. 151 and 152 is to mirror the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2014 and the Roads Act 2015, which relate to the terms and conditions of service of staff members.  This wording was sought and agreed with the trade unions and stakeholders during the consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#M02000","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's response.

The Minister of State may be able to reassure us that all of this is accounted for but it is a newer and concerning development in the context of third level institutions.

I have raised some of the points relating to this matter previously.  The word \"community\" is in there somewhere as well.  The point is that the plans of the technological university, TU, to provide programmes of education and training should meet the needs of citizens - Deputy Burton made a fair point about that word - business, enterprise and the professions.  I am a member of a profession.  Where do the arts and culture, particularly courses not of a business, enterprise or professional nature, fit in?<\/p>  <p>  I will not press my amendment because it includes a flaw but I will speak on it.  In the amendment, I have added in the plans of the TU \"to retain, maintain and develop the existing campuses of its applicant institutes including but not limited to its existing programmes of education, training and research\".  I have not taken account of campuses that may well be closing in the city of Dublin but I want to ensure that there is some protection for Blanchardstown, Tallaght and the regional institutions.  This is my party's main point.<\/p>  <p>  In this amendment, I am probably too restrictive in the context of the programmes relating to education, training and research.  <\/p>  <p>               I do not want to legislate to retain an exact range of courses as universities should have the academic freedom to provide the courses it wants to provide.  Can the Minister of State assure us that if an institution becomes a TU, a multidisciplinary range of courses will be available?  Can she assure us that institutions such as that in Blanchardstown will not turn into a specialised college for a specialised subject but will be similar to now, with a range of courses provided to meet the needs of the community in the surrounding area?<\/p> <p> Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 64, to which I will return on Report Stage, concerns what we want to be included in the strategic plan.  It is proposed that the plans of the TU will ensure the geographic names of its various campuses are maintained in its nomenclature relating to each campus.  This means the Blanchardstown institution will be called the TU for Dublin at Blanchardstown, with the other the TU for Dublin at Tallaght, similar the TUs in Tralee or Cork.  This is the case for the various campuses of the University of Ulster.  Deputy Lahart raised the issue in respect of Tallaght and pointed out that some people want it to be called TU Tallaght.  That is not going to happen because it is going to be part of one body.  The name \"Tallaght\" should be retained somewhere, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#T02200","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":883,"content":"<p>TU4Dublin is committed to fully-serviced campuses.

This is a subject of major importance to Ireland today and it is timely that I am making this presentation on the same day as the Government is launching the citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments and his support for the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and assure the members that the IFA will not be found wanting in spreading the message.  I am joined by our director general, Mr. Damien McDonald and our Oireachtas liaison officer Ms Elaine Farrell, who is well known to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The UK decision to leave the EU will impact hugely on Ireland.  It is timely, therefore, to take stock of what the EU project now stands for and what direction it should take.  Of all of the sectors in society, farmers are those who are most aware of the benefits that EU membership has brought.  For Irish farmers, EU membership has meant access to a market of 500 million consumers, the stability provided by CAP payments and the ability to grow and diversify our export markets.<\/p> <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy was provided for in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and its objectives were set out in that treaty.  These are to increase agricultural productivity, to ensure a fair standard of living for farmers, to stabilise markets, to ensure the availability of supplies, and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  These principles remain equally relevant today.<\/p> <p>  Financial solidarity was a key principle of the new CAP, with spending on the CAP to be borne by the central European budget.  The CAP is of vital importance for producers and provides European consumers with a plentiful supply of high quality, sustainable food produced at affordable prices.  There is now recognition for the multiple roles of farmers as food, fuel and energy producers in addition to meeting environmental requirements and other public goods.  Over the years, it has undergone significant reforms, responding to the demands of European society and consumers.  The current two-pillar structure of the CAP addresses complementary but differing needs.  The role of the basic payment and market support measures in Pillar 1 is to support farm incomes and the delivery of public goods.  The main focus of the rural development programme under Pillar 2 is on farm-based, economic, environmental and social programmes delivered at member state and regional level.<\/p> <p>  The next CAP reform will take place in the context of new challenges facing Europe, including market volatility, climate change, and the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs.  Farmers are committed to delivering on the public good requirements relating to the environment and climate change.  This is in addition to the delivery of quality food and meeting the highest regulatory standards in the areas of food safety and animal health and welfare.  In return, farmers must be provided with a fair standard of living.  Low farm incomes in many sectors continue to provide a challenge to the sustainability of farming enterprises across the EU, and to attracting new entrants into farming.  Simplification of the CAP is also critical.  The reform of the CAP over many decades has led to a serious increase in the regulatory burden on farm enterprises.  The EU is blamed for the bureaucracy and red tape associated with the CAP.  The rules of the payment system and inspection regime must take into account the realities of farming, and the increased use of technology and risk-based analysis must be progressed.  The IFA believes that the EU should set as a target in the next CAP reform the delivery of a strong, sustainable and competitive agriculture for the benefit of farmers and consumers alike.<\/p><p>This requires a strongly funded CAP budget, reversing the cuts imposed in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the period 2014 to 2020, through direct income support and market management measures in pillar 1, and co-financed farm schemes in pillar 2. <br\/><br\/>In the Commission's White Paper on the future of Europe, published last March, a number of potential scenarios for the development of the EU project are outlined, and their potential impact on key policy areas are summarised.  From a farming perspective, the IFA believes that continuing the completion of the Single Market remains very important.  Now, more than ever, free access to and regulatory coherence within the EU market is very important.  However, this should not be the sole focus of the future EU.  In addition, strengthening existing common policies, such as the CAP, is critical to securing a strong future for the EU, and in demonstrating to citizens the positives of EU membership.  The Commission's June reflection paper on the future of the EU finances identifies that the CAP reaches farmers and citizens even in the most marginal areas of the EU, having a positive impact on economic and social development in those areas.  It further suggests that improvement to the policy can arise from putting more emphasis on incentivising farmers to deliver environmental and climate public goods and services.  The IFA is very concerned, however, that in four of the five scenarios outlined for the future EU budget in the paper, a reduction to the CAP budget, either as a percentage of the overall EU budget, or a direct cut, is envisaged. <br\/><br\/>The IFA recognises the challenges facing the EU budget, including the withdrawal of the UK, a net contributor, from the EU, and the need to finance new priorities.  It is unacceptable, however, that existing budget programmes, such as those associated with the CAP and cohesion funding, would be simply reduced to accommodate new challenges.  The IFA believes that member states should increase their contributions, if necessary, to take account of Brexit, to fund existing policies, such as CAP and cohesion policies, and to take on new priorities, where agreed between member states.<br\/><br\/>The last MFF was agreed against a backdrop of economic downturn in the European Union, with direct cuts to the CAP budget.  Since then, there has been a significant recovery for the EU economy.  The IFA believes the future CAP budget should be linked to the growth of the EU economy, which would enable increases in funding.<br\/><br\/>Let me refer to a couple of the other issues that arise.  Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agrifood sector since we joined the EU.  With 40% of our food exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector is as exposed in these negotiations.  The outcome of the Brexit discussions, and the impact on different member states and sectors, is very much linked with the discussion on the future of Europe.  The IFA has set as key priorities for the agriculture sector in these negotiations the maintenance of the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and EU, while preserving the value of the UK market, and the provision of a strong CAP budget following the UK's departure.  The optimum outcome is that the UK remains within the customs union and the Single Market.  This would address both trade and border issues.  The next best option is that we have a comprehensive free-trade agreement between the EU and UK with tariff-free trade for agricultural products and food; the maintenance of equivalent standards on food safety, animal health, welfare and the environment; and the application of a common external tariff for food imports to both the EU and the UK.<br\/><br\/>On EU trade policy, within the EU there must be greater coherence between the CAP and EU trade policy.  It is essential that the correct balance be found between the opening new markets, availing of trade opportunities and protecting sensitive sectors. <b><\/b>The value of the EU market cannot be undermined by increases in low-cost food imports that do not meet the high food-safety, animal welfare, health and environmental standards that are required of EU producers.  Mercosur is a case in point. The EU seems hell-bent on securing a Mercosur deal regardless of the costs to agriculture and the impact on rural areas.<b><\/b>In recent weeks, the EU have already offered an additional 70,000 tonnes of beef quota to Mercosur countries, and this comes on top of preferential market access they already have, representing 246,000 tonnes.  There is already talk of more.<b><\/b>We know from the Brazilian weak flesh fraud those concerned fail to meet EU standards on all of the key issues of traceability, food safety and the environment.<b><\/b>Indeed, the latest EU report from the Food and Veterinary Office states the Brazilian competent authority is not in a position to guarantee that the relevant export requirements are met.<i><\/i>In addition, the report states the competent authorities are signing export report certificates despite being unable to ascertain the veracity of certain statements therein.<b><\/b>In Ireland, the sector is based on meeting the highest standards and environmentally sustainable grassland production systems.<b><\/b>Irish beef production systems are between two and four times more efficient than South American production in terms of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.  It is well established that the growth in South American beef exports, particularly exports from Brazil, has come about on the back of widespread destruction of the rainforest in the Pantanal and Amazon regions.  It would be a total contradiction of EU policy on climate change for Europe to agree a Mercosur deal that replaces sustainable EU beef production for European consumers with product from South America, which has a much higher carbon footprint.<br\/><br\/>On top of all of these issues, we have Brexit.  Half our beef exports go to the UK market.  Therefore, Mercosur negotiations at this time make no sense whatsoever.  I would go so far as to say they are reckless.  We are requesting that our Taoiseach and Minister redouble their efforts in opposition to Mercosur in defence of our key beef sector. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In the area of climate change, while I am concerned by retired professor Alan Matthews's proposal to the Citizens' Assembly to introduce a further &euro;30 million trade-distorting carbon tax on the sector, I am reassured by the perspective of An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that Ireland's focus on cutting emissions should be on energy and transport, given that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 130% since 1990, at a time when emissions from the agriculture sector have declined by almost 6%, despite our output increasing by more than 40%.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the European focus of today, I am extremely concerned about the impact on the future sustainable development of Ireland's agrifood sector arising from positions taken by our Members of the European Parliament regarding the Commission's 2030 climate proposals.  Their position fails to recognise the October 2014 European Council decision that recognises that agriculture has multiple roles and that food production must not be threatened when addressing the climate challenge.  Of specific concern are the amendments to change the 2030 starting point from the average of 2016, 2017 and 2018 to 2020 and the reduction in the LULUCF allowances.  These will impact most on Ireland and will lead to an additional liability of more than &euro;1 billion.  The strong position taken by Government, particularly the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, is welcome in the ongoing discussions.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is taking a leading position in Europe by targeting European funding, through the CAP, at measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.<\/p><p>Some 87% of the measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme have climate reducing elements.  Irish farmers participate in carbon monitoring, measuring and management through programmes such as Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green programme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s beef data and genomics programme and the green low carbon agriculture scheme, GLAS.  All of these schemes promotes the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices.  Farmers will continue to build on our sustainable model of food production and to seek to make improvements in carbon efficiency right across the food supply chain. <\/p><p> One of the initiatives in place is the IFA-led smart farming programme, run in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Smart farming is farmer-led and focuses on demonstrating win-win situations that improve farm incomes, enhance the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to input into the discussions on the future of Europe.  The coming months will be very important in the context of expected initial proposals on the multi-annual financial framework post 2020, and the further development of the Commission position on the reform of the CAP.  It is critically important that the Government, led by the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as Commissioner Hogan at EU level, make the strongest case for a fully-funded CAP post 2020.  Irish farmers remain strongly positive towards the European Union, recognising the benefits that EU membership and the CAP have delivered.  I hope that the outcomes of these discussions can deliver practical changes and contribute to delivering a stronger and better Europe for all its citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for his broad overview.

Mr. Healy, his predecessors and the staff who work in the IFA are very helpful to us as politicians at all times.  The back-up, assistance, networking and general support that it gives to our farming community, in good times and in bad, is second to none.

It speaks before us regularly and gave a very strong presentation to the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union hearings earlier in the year.  Despite my accent there are 63 members of the IFA living in my constituency.  While it is not perhaps a big issue for many of my constituents as other people around this table there are a few key issues in which a few of us Dubs have an interest.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the witness on his re-election.  It was a mighty contest and it is a reflection on the work he has been doing in recent years. <\/p> <p>  On the wider area of new alliances for Ireland in Europe in the future, one of our strongest alliances, when it comes to the CAP, is with France.  The witness raised a number of concerns about Mercosur.  I understand and share those concerns.  In a previous life, in the trade portfolio, I covered the regions in the committee.  It was easier then because we were talking about the trade deal with Japan, but there were issues with the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  However, Mercosur presents a different level of challenge to Ireland specifically that our colleagues in Europe may not feel to the same extent.  TTIP and CETA raised challenges for trade movement in Germany and that challenge was far more pronounced than it was here.  What are the alliances for the IFA in terms of other farm organisations across Europe, and how is it working to build agreement?  When it comes to the CAP and agricultural policy in general does, Mr. Healy agree that France remains our strongest ally?  How do we retain that alliance?  As the current French President is a Europhile, perhaps it will be easier but it will be more difficult as one sees the rise of the hard left and the protectionist nature of Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon and others within France.<\/p> <p> I want to ask about the IFA's role in the conversation on all European issues in the future.  Mr. Healy's statement that \"Irish farmers remain strongly positive towards the European Union, recognising the benefits that EU membership and the CAP have delivered\" is key.  I appreciate the strong role that the IFA has played, especially in recent months, in terms of preparing their members and Irish society at large for the fallout from Brexit.  There have been rare occasions where I would argue that the IFA's contribution to the pro-European movement in Ireland has been lacking.  I am thinking of the first Lisbon treaty, when it entered the debate at a very late stage and was not enthusiastic in its support.  The vacuum created allowed many of the misinformed eurosceptic organisations to take a hold and take root in certain rural communities, which ultimately led to the fall of that referendum.  When the referendum was run a second time, as well as with the one on the fiscal stability treaty, we saw the IFA throw their resources behind it.  I fear greatly, however, that in the future, that calculated risk could be taken again.  I am not talking as someone who is looking for constant balanced argument.  I am talking strongly as a really pro-European politician.  I believe Europe is the key to the future of our agrifood sector.  We were at the launch of a future of Europe discussion this morning.  There has been a 90-fold increase in trade for Ireland since we joined the EEC in 1973.  Much of that trade has been in the agrifood sector.  While the challenges of Brexit will be massive for the agrifood industry - particularly for certain things such as cheddar cheese - we will still rely on our next nearest market beyond the UK being the EU.  While there is huge potential in south-east Asia in particular for certain sectors, and indeed Australia, but ultimately our greatest level of partnership will be on the Continent.  I make my next point as a comment, not a challenge.  As we go forward into this highly challenging post-Brexit era, where the Government and Irish civic society will be committed to having good relations with the UK but to staying in and being at the heart of the EU, where our future lies, we really need to see the IFA and other similar organisations maintain that commitment.  I do not want to take away from what Mr. Healy said.  I was heartened to hear it but I want to put on record that we need to see that commitment constantly in the future.  I am all for constructive criticism where needs be but I warn against the occasional calculated risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#E00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>As I represent an urban constituency in Dublin Bay North, agricultural issues do not arise very often.  That said, I appreciate the important role that agriculture plays in the national economy.  Mr. Healy pointed out that 40% of our food exports go to the UK, and that makes Brexit a great challenge for all of us.<\/p> <p>  If my questions appear very basic it is because I am not involved in the day-to-day detail of agricultural policy.  From where does the threat to CAP arise?  Mr. Healy made the point strongly that we should be committed to a fully-funded CAP post 2020.  All of us will agree with that, it is in our national interest and the joint committee should include the country's strong commitment to the CAP process as a nation state in our final report.<\/p><p>Is it purely a budgetary issue from the point of view of the European Union as a whole or is it maybe something to do with increased urbanisation?  Where do the farmers see the threat to CAP coming from?  Mr. Healy mentioned that most of the scenarios put forward by the European Commission envisage the CAP being reduced in some way or other.<\/p><p> On a separate but maybe related issue, do the witnesses have statistics for the consumption of beef and meat generally?  There seems to be a movement in urban areas to say that meat is bad for one.  Perhaps it has to do with climate change, I am not sure, or maybe it is a health issue too and young people in particular are becoming vegetarian.  Is that of concern to the IFA and farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#E00400","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>I cannot let the opportunity go by to remind everybody that the Deputy's late father, God be good to him, sold an awful lot of beef for us at a critical time when nobody else was capable of doing it.

He is right when he speaks about France.  The IFA is aligned throughout Europe because it is part of COPA, the European umbrella body for farm organisations.  We are the only Irish organisation associated with it.  I had a meeting with it last week in Brussels and will meet it again at the end of the month.  We are constantly in touch with our fellow organisations throughout Europe.  We have a very strong relationship with the French because we think alike on many issues and CAP is one of them.  We deal with farm organisations across Europe, whether in Denmark or Belgium, or wherever.  I am vice president of COPA.  The president is a German who comes from the same region as the Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources, Mr. Oettinger.  He came to speak at one of our recent meetings.  Having those alliances and constantly building them is very important for the IFA.  We not only meet at the meetings but we often meet for bilaterals too.  It is crucial to have that.  There is no point in our organisation looking for an extension to, for example, the glyphosate licence or an increase in the CAP budget on our own.  We have to be sure we have support.<\/p> <p>  I would take issue with the comment that the IFA was lacking in the past.  The one time we were lacking and got our backs behind it, the vote was carried and rural Ireland did support it.  That proved how crucial the organisation is.  <\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the main threat to the future funding of CAP comes from the exit of the UK.  It is a net contributor to CAP to the tune of &euro;3 billion.  It gives &euro;10 billion to the EU budget, &euro;6 billion of that goes to CAP, &euro;3 billion of which goes to UK farmers.  If we take &euro;3 billion out of the total CAP budget of between &euro;56 billion and &euro;58 billion, that is a sizeable 5% to 6% drop.  There is also the question of the new EU initiatives being discussed, to do with security or defence.  Our argument is that for any new priorities there must be new money.<\/p> <p>  Maybe our organisations and politicians have failed over the years to get across the benefit of CAP.  People see it as a benefit to farmers across Europe.  CAP has benefited the 500 million European consumers very significantly.  When it was introduced in the early 1960s, 30% of the average household income was being spent on food.  Today, for better quality food that is more traceable and produced to a much higher standard, only between 10% and 12% of the average household income is spent on food.  CAP has allowed an adequate supply of safe, traceable, quality food to be produced at very affordable prices.  Those are the threats. <\/p> <p>  To answer the second part of the question about beef, Europe is already 102% self-sufficient in beef supply.  When the UK leaves it will be 116% self-sufficient in beef.  The European consumption of beef is dropping year on year, for various reasons maybe because well-known models or sports stars advertise on social media against it without any scientific backup &ndash; that is possible nowadays on social media.  That is why I say talk of a Mercosur deal is reckless, based on consumption dropping, an oversupply already and that oversupply getting worse, going from 102% to 116% in a couple of years' time when the UK leaves the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510758000,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I will just echo some of the comments made by Mr. Healy.  The IFA has always been a staunchly European organisation.  We supported the European Union and that remains the association's position.  As most members of the committee know, however, there are frustrations with the European Union among farmers.  It is important that they are not forgotten.  The president has already outlined the situation in respect of Mercosur and the potential implications of Brexit and how the EU will respond to that.  Commissioner Hogan has talked a lot about the simplification of the CAP.  While it is critical, it has frustrated some farmers by bringing in a lot of red tape and bureaucracy, some of it perceived as unnecessary.  A move to simplify it and make it easier for the participants would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  Farmers are frustrated.  There is the upcoming vote on glyphosate where the European scientific agencies are giving the green light to this product yet the political system is not responding to that.  A decision has not yet been arrived at.  It did not get through for ten years.  A five-year approval was not passed.  It is down to four years now and will go to appeal.  That causes frustration for farmers as European citizens who say if we are not basing what we do on science where does that leave us.  It raises questions such as if the European Union prohibits certain products, and there are plenty of those already, it does not seem to apply the same standards to products which are imported which can be used although they contain some products that are banned in the EU.  It places them at a competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>  The IFA, like any association, is a democracy and I would not be aware of the background to the Lisbon treaty but it is important that Irish citizens' support, farmers included, for the EU, which has generally been very strong, is not taken for granted.  That is a message the EU has to take on board.  Our position has always been that we negotiate as an EU 27 and back the European position.  We met Michel Barnier and we are very much part of that process.<\/p><p>However, if farmers are faced with a scenario where we have Brexit and the UK goes off and does its own thing and then we find the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, being eroded, our markets being eroded because agriculture becomes a sacrificial lamb in a trade deal with Mercosur, that is not a way to keep European citizens behind the EU project.  It is important that the European Union delivers for farmers and all citizens if it is to continue to keep its support.  The President made a point about Mercosur and the carbon impact of beef coming from Brazil versus the carbon impact of beef in Ireland.  It can be two or four times the land use changes involved because a lot of rain forests are being felled in Brazil to turn them into pasture land.  However, there are, at any point in time over the past number of years, between 6 and 7 million cattle in Ireland.  There are 226 million cattle in Brazil.  That is the scale and one can see how frustrated Irish farmers are when they see the emphasis being placed on methane output from 1 million cattle and the European Union going to facilitate a much less carbon-efficient beef production coming into the European Union from one country.  There are 53 million more cattle in Argentina.  The policies and decisions that the European Union makes have to make sense to farmers and the citizens.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Can I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510758000,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>To add to what Mr. McDonald said, and this is in the presentation, we as farmers in Ireland and across Europe see the bureaucracy, the red tape, the standards, the traceability that we have to have in order to qualify for various payments, in order to qualify to get our cattle killed and in order to qualify to farm.

I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officer in the older people&rsquo;s projects unit, and Dr. Jean Long from the Health Research Board.<\/p> <p>  Improving home care services so that people can live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible is a key commitment of Government.  Home supports are crucial to helping older people and, indeed, people of all ages with particular care needs to remain where they want to be, namely, at home in the surroundings with which they are most familiar and comfortable.<\/p><p> This is an opportune time to meet with the committee because the Department has commenced work on designing a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care.  I look forward to hearing the views of the committee as well as the perspectives of the other speakers here today.  Before I speak about plans for the future, it is important to first consider where we are at the moment. <\/p><p> I will mention rights and eligibility for home care services first.  At present, home care services are provided through the HSE on the basis of assessed health care need and no personal contribution towards the cost is required.  The HSE provides services both directly and through service level agreements with private and voluntary sector providers.  The current system relies heavily on family carers, who play a crucial role in helping older people and others that need help to remain living in their own homes for longer.  These carers not only make a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of those that they care for, but also make an important and often unacknowledged contribution to the economy.  This is reflected in the 2016 census results published earlier this month, which identified that about 195,000 carers are providing a minimum of 6.6 hours of care per week.    <\/p><p> I will now consider resources.  The HSE will spend approximately &euro;370 million on home care in 2017, out of a total budget of &euro;765 million for services for older people.  This figure excludes funding for the nursing homes support scheme.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan provides for a target of just over 10.5 million home help hours; almost 17,000 home care packages; and 190 intensive home care packages, co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, for clients with complex needs, particularly those living with dementia. <\/p><p> In budget 2018 a further &euro;37 million has been made available to further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.  A significant proportion of this additional funding will go towards home care services.  The resources available for home care services, while significant, are limited, and with the increase in our elderly population, demand is growing year-on-year.  Accordingly, the services and allocation of resources to individual clients, require prudent management on an ongoing basis as demands for services increase.  In this context, those clients who are assessed and approved for home care, and who are not being provided immediately with a service, are risk-assessed and placed on a waiting list for a resource as it becomes available.  It is important to note that many people also purchase home care services directly from private providers.<\/p><p> I will now address regulation.  Home care services are among the health and social care services for which there is currently no statutory regulation.  However, the HSE is progressing a range of measures to improve home care provision overall, to standardise services nationally, and to promote quality and safety.  This includes a national procurement framework for home care services, which came into effect in 2012 and was put out to tender again in 2016.  This provides a mechanism for quality assurance.  Providers are also monitored through service level agreements with the HSE.<\/p><p> I will now address the plans for the new statutory home care scheme.  While the existing home care service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it is recognised that home care services need to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The Department is of the view that a stand-alone funding scheme designed specifically for home care is needed, together with an effective system of regulation.  In 2016 the Department&rsquo;s intention to bring forward legislative proposals for the regulation of home care was indicated in a report entitled Better Health, Improving Healthcare.  The programme for a partnership Government signalled the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the introduction of a uniform home care service.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, Deputy Helen McEntee played a key role in advancing this undertaking, tasking the Department with the development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care.<\/p><p> The new scheme will improve access to home care in an affordable and sustainable way.  It will provide transparency around service allocation and individuals&rsquo; eligibility for services, and ensure that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner across the country.  The scheme will also result in more effective integration with other health supports including nursing, therapies, and other primary care services.  A system of regulation will be designed to ensure public confidence in the standard of the services provided, and to bring Ireland in line with best international practice.  It will be important to get the balance right in this regard and to ensure that the system of regulation is effective and not overly bureaucratic.<\/p><p> I will now speak about progress to date.  As an initial step in developing the new system, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board, HRB, to undertake a review of the home care systems in place in four European countries.  The review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience.  The committee will shortly be hearing from Jean Long of the Health Research Board, who will speak in more detail about the findings of this review.<\/p><p> The Department also launched a public consultation process on the financing and regulation of home care in July of this year.  Over 2,600 responses to this phase of the consultation process were received.  The purpose of this public consultation was to enable us to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home care provision.  Preliminary analysis of the submissions has been undertaken, and we would be happy to share details of some of the initial findings this morning if that would be of assistance to the committee.  A full report on the findings of the consultation will be published early next year.  This will inform the Department&rsquo;s development of the new funding scheme and regulatory arrangements.<\/p><p> The process for determining the type of home care scheme and approach to regulation that is best for Ireland is complex.  A significant amount of analysis is needed to develop policy proposals on the form of the home care scheme and the system of regulation that will apply to these services.  It is important that we get this right and take the time required to ensure that these measures will be successful, affordable and sustainable.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us to present here this morning, and I look forward to continuing engagement throughout the process of developing the new home care scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to make a presentation of our findings.  On behalf of the Department of Health, the HRB commissioned an evidence review titled Approaches to Regulation and Financing of Home Care Services in Four European Countries.  The countries examined were Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Scotland.  It was published in April 2017 and covered two topics.<\/p> <p>  The first topic was the regulation of formal home care services.  All four countries have explicit national legislation and policy covering formal home care services.  The national government controls the vision for home care, but regional governments oversee the selection of home care services that will be publicly funded.  Support to keep people living in their own homes is the main principle underpinning home care policy in all four countries.  There is a long tradition of regulated formal home care in the Netherlands and Scotland, whereas regulated formal home care was introduced later in Sweden and Germany.<\/p> <p>  Excepting Sweden, three of the four countries have national a set of quality standards for home care services that are guided by legislative acts.  In addition, the three countries have an independent inspectorate to assess quality standards.  Quality standards have been determined by the regulator with input from patient representatives in Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland.  To achieve accreditation, home care service providers in Germany and the Netherlands are expected to operate using an in-house quality management system, and are also responsible for ensuring that staff are properly qualified and suitably remunerated.  Annual quality audits are carried out by external bodies in Germany and the Netherlands, and accreditation is awarded if the audit results meet the standards.  Scotland operates a national annual compulsory registration scheme, and registration is determined on the basis of meeting basic standard requirements.  Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland have common national minimum training criteria for home care workers. <\/p> <p>  In Germany and Scotland, random inspections are carried out on home care providers annually to ensure standards are adhered to.  In addition, specific complaints are investigated separately.  The Netherlands monitors home care services via annual surveys, and inspections are only carried out in response to specific complaints.<\/p><p>In Sweden, regular inspections, surveys and responses to specific complaints are completed.  Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden publish results of home care service quality inspections on publicly accessible websites.  Germany, the Netherlands, and Scotland operate sanctions if quality standards are not adhered to.  In each country, regulatory bodies are or appear to be partly funded through contributions made by long-term care insurances, or by registration fees paid by care providers. <\/p><p> On approaches to assessing and financing home care services, need rather than the ability to pay for home care services is an underlying principle of formal home care provision in all four countries.  Germany and the Netherlands have long-established long-term care insurance schemes which facilitated the provision of formal home care services and these have recently been subject to reforms, which included revised needs assessments and eligibility entitlements alongside the introduction of increased or additional co-payments.  Scotland and Sweden have a long-standing rights-oriented home care services sector funded through taxation, which are increasingly being rationed by stricter eligibility criteria and the introduction of fixed fee services and co-payments. <\/p><p> All four countries have formal needs assessment which contain documented eligibility criteria that allows a fair and comparative assessment as to the need for formal home care and the level of requirements.  All four countries encourage some level of informal care by close relatives to help fill the home care requirement.  All four countries have an element of user choice as to how services are provided to address formal home care requirements, with services typically offered in kind or via personal budgets.  The basket of formal home care services in the four countries include personal care and help with household tasks.  Nursing care is included in the basket of services in Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland and is provided through a separate assessment process in Sweden.<\/p><p> Generally, the literature on the four countries reported that the supply of formal home care could meet the demand, but their actions indicate that countries have taken interventions to either restrict formal home care supply or fund additional demand.  For example, Germany has increased the long-term insurance premium for childless people, increased co-payments to 30% of the total formal home care costs, tightened the criteria for how much home care people can receive, and expects families to provide informal care where the formal care service cannot meet the demand.  The Netherlands has waiting lists and has reduced its needs-based service allocation by tightening access criteria.  Scotland has increased the budget allocated to home care and asked citizens who earn over &pound;16,000 to pay for household tasks.  Sweden has also tightened criteria entitling its citizens to home care.  Small co-payments are required for all services in Sweden.  Tax free credits are available to taxpayers who buy private home care for their elderly relatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jean Long","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>We will take questions in groups of three so I ask the witnesses to take note of them.

Their studies have been very comprehensive.  I have concern based on looking at how we legislate here.  I mentioned it earlier but in 2012 I produced a Private Members' Bill in 2012 on professional indemnity insurance for medical practitioners, Senator James Reilly had brought in a Private Members Bill when he was a Deputy in 2009, and it is only this morning that a regulation finally went through to make it compulsory for all medical practitioners to have professional indemnity insurance.  That is a seven or eight year time period from when the legislation is discussed to it being put through.  The fair deal scheme was similar.  Problems arose in 2004 on nursing homes and it was 2009 before the fair deal scheme was set up.  I published a Private Members' Bill on home care regulation on foot of the Law Reform Commission report which was also a comprehensive report.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing new regulation and new legislation and we are talking about the initial stages.  How advanced is the Department on new regulation and legislation?  If we start the process of bringing forward draft proposals, whether by regulation or legislation, what timescale are we be talking about?  If it is legislation, when are we likely to see the heads of a Bill on this?  The Law Reform Commission has done considerable work on this area and I am interested in what kind of legislation it has proposed.  I understand that the companies which provide home care have a code and this works reasonably well but there is no legislation governing who can provide home care.  What timescale are we talking about?  To be fair to the two witnesses here and the Departmental officials, much work has been done but we question is now about taking decisive action in view of there being huge growth in the numbers of people over 65 years between now and 2030.  My concern is that it is currently 637,000 and will be over a million by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#F01100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Spillane and Dr. Long for their presentations.  It is a real indication of how seriously the Department is taking home care.  The witnesses rightly commended the Minister of State, Deputy Helen MacEntee, for her leadership on this, and she has passed the baton to Deputy Jim Daly who I am confident will progress this with the same rigour and enthusiasm.  I have two general points.  First, it is the clear preference of people themselves, older people, those with dementia who may be under 65 years, to live at home in their own communities for as long as possible.  That preference for home care needs to be at the heart of the Department's deliberations.  It is an obvious point but it is one that can be missed.  Last year Age Action Ireland, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and UCD were involved in a report which is a very good source document which can be consulted, there is no need to do it again.  We have loads of consultations and have done all that, and got a huge response.  It is the wish among individuals and we are talking about ourselves.  We are all living longer.  It is not an abstract point, but an enlightened self-interest in getting this right.<\/p> <p>  Second, and this is something Ms Spillane mentioned, is the position with regard to the 195,000 carers.  With support from the State, in partnership, they can continue to do the work they want to.  They will not down tools when a home care system is brought in.<\/p><p>They want to be involved but they do not want to be carrying the burden by themselves.  They are urgently awaiting this scheme.  I accept that progress is being made, but we cannot let deadlines slip.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that 4,000 of these 195,000 carers are under 15 years of age and almost 2,000 are over 85 years of age, an increase in the latter of 35% according to the census.  The will and preference of individuals and the strain on carers must be front and centre.  <br\/><br\/>Ms Spillane mentioned that &euro;370 million is being spent on home care.  It would be helpful if she would compare that spend with what is being spent on residential care.  What budget is being allocated for home care in 2018 relative to 2017, in respect not only of older people but home care specifically and what money is being set aside for dementia-specific home care, which is a very particular form of home care in terms of the manner in which it needs to be provided?  Consistency and duration of care in this area is critical.  One cannot hurry people with dementia.  <br\/><br\/>Like Senator Burke I would welcome more information about the proposed regulatory system, including when it will come into force.  There is currently no entitlement <i>per se<\/i>to home care such as applies in respect of residential care.  Resources are limited and there is no statutory regulation and as such there is an urgency in this area.  During statements in the Seanad on the fair deal scheme, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, promised that the consultation on home care would be completed by the end of this year.  We are now told it will not be completed until early in the new year.  I am concerned about slippage in this regard because as I said the 195,000 carers and those for whom they care cannot wait.  <br\/><br\/>My next question is to Dr. Long.  In the four countries which she studied there are systems of regulation and funding regimes.  Is it true to say that we are lagging behind significantly in terms of a proper system of home care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#F01200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I remind members and witnesses to ensure their mobile phones are switched off as they cause interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>My apologies for leaving the meeting for a short time but I had to make a number of emergency calls.  I agree with the comments of the last speaker in regard to home care.  I have a couple of questions for the witnesses.  In regard to the private providers, how is that system working?  Has it been assessed in terms of operation, efficiency and cost?  Is it cost-effective?  I recognise that it is better for provision to be made in this way rather than for the system to take it on board but I would like to know whether it is effective, cost effective and efficient.  By \"effective\" I mean effective to the person receiving the care.<\/p> <p>  This is a cross-departmental issue.  I note that in recent times there have been a number of refusals of carer's allowance to people who would appear to me to be eligible.  Some people are reluctant to have strangers in their home.  They have a built-in resistance to it, which I can understand.  It is important that in situations where family members take time off work to care for an elderly or sick relative they are paid for doing so by the relevant Department.  I am doing all I can to ensure this is done.  In the case of dementia, it is not possible to dismiss a person's need based on appearance and so on.  These cases are not easy to deal with because those concerned require care, attention and constant supervision.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to regulation, is Ms Spillane satisfied with the extent to which the regulations are likely to be applied throughout the system, particularly in terms of contracted carers?  The current system is welcome in that households are now visited a number of times throughout the day by different carers as opposed to the previous system whereby a single carer was assigned to a particular household for a number of years, often to the detriment of his or her own health and thus leading him or her to also needing care.  We need to be conscious of the carer in the household nearing the situation where he or she will also need help and assistance.<\/p> <p>  To what extent will the care in the home scheme be extended by way of the existing carer in the home and the contracted carer system?  In other words, how is it proposed to meet demand?  The fair deal scheme is cumbersome, to say the least, and it is unlikely to improve.  What I cannot understand is why at a time of scarcity in terms of residential care beds the HSE is attempting to close down existing units.  Despite the increase in demand, a number of residential beds are being closed or used for purposes other than catering for the additional demand.  I am aware of two public nursing homes where this is happening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>Would Ms Spillane like to respond to the questions thus far?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke asked how advanced we are in terms of the proposals.

The experience referenced in terms of the fair deal scheme is indicative because there are parallels between the two processes but we intend to do this quicker than was done in respect of the fair deal scheme.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about regulation.  The Department recognises and acknowledges the need for regulation of home care services.  This service is either funded by the HSE or privately.  The new system will help to promote quality and client safety.  In addition, it will ensure that the public can be confident in services and that the services being provided to their relatives and loved ones are of the type they need and are of appropriate quality.  To develop the regulatory system we will be considering the experience of other jurisdictions.  Dr. Long's report will be very helpful in this regard.  We will also be taking into account the expertise in this country.  For example, we will engage with HIQA and we will consider Senator Burke's Bill which builds on the work of the Law Reform Commission.  This process will be about learning what we can and adapting.  We cannot pick a system and introduce it in Ireland.  Any system would have to be tailored to the particular requirements we have in this country.<\/p><p>I should mention, however, that while we do not have a statutory scheme of regulation, the Health Service Executive took a significant step towards quality assurance in 2012 when it introduced the single procurement framework for external providers of home care services.  The framework includes quality standards for governance and accountability, person centred care, complaints management and training and qualifications.  Providers are monitored by the HSE through service level agreements and are required to provide a range of information on their services.  It is our intention to build on this good work and place the regulatory system on a statutory footing as quickly as we can. <\/p><p> In terms of a timeline for the development of the regulatory system, it is our intention to make parallel proposals on regulation and the statutory scheme.  The reason both processes will be done in tandem is that we want them to mesh well, as opposed to having them develop in isolation. <\/p><p> It is interesting to note the finding of a recent opinion poll commissioned by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that 76% of respondents mistakenly believed home care services were already being regulated.

We are familiar with the excellent Age Action report to which the Senator referred.  Similarly, when we designed the consultation process we were anxious to hear the views of people who avail of services and we went to great trouble to offer an easy read version of the questionnaire.  The responses received represent a good cross-section of opinion.  As indicated, we can provide members with some details of the survey if they would consider that helpful.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher also referred to the large number of carers who are waiting anxiously for the scheme.  The research done by the Health Research Board makes clear that the formal home care schemes provided in other countries are very much viewed as complementary to family carers.  Ideally, one engages in extensive consultation and takes account of people's views when offering a service to an individual.  We would like to move in that direction and we are examining this issue in the disability sector through the task force on personalised services.  Many of the lessons emerging from the task force's work are relevant to this area also.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher also asked a question on the budget for home care.  The home care budget for 2017 is &euro;373 million compared with &euro;940 million for the nursing homes support scheme.  Funding for the former equates to approximately 40% of funding for the latter.  The Senator also asked how the home care budget for 2017 compared with the budget for 2018.  As I indicated, an additional &euro;37 million is being provided for older people's services.  A significant proportion of this - probably two thirds of the total - will be for home care.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a specific figure on funding for dementia but I can check this for the Senator.  The Department is in discussion with the HSE on the service plan.  If the Senator wishes, we will provide the figure in writing at a later stage.

In terms of private providers, under a longstanding arrangement, there has been a mix between services provided by the HSE voluntary organisations and private companies.  The issue is one of ensuring these three strands mesh well and we will emphasise this in the development of the new scheme.  We cannot have different providers working in isolation.  We need them to work together to improve outcomes for service users and build services around the user, as opposed to the provider of the service.<\/p> <p>  The issue of informal care was raised a number of times.  We fully recognise that informal carers are the backbone of home care provision.  What we need to do is ensure informal carers are appropriately supported to deliver care, which is the reason the issue also arose in the consultation process.  We need to ensure that we get the balance right between family carers and formal carers and that they work effectively together.  This is a complicating factor because we have providers who view the matter from a formal provider perspective.  We need to ensure they also see the perspective of family carers and that we design the system in a way that supports family carers to do what they want to do.  It is clear that people want to support their family members by helping them to stay at home.  However, they need the support and help from services and service providers to do this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also referred to regulation and asked how we would meet demand.  Demand is increasing and there are demographic challenges facing the country.

Are there any plans for more respite to give those family members a break?<\/p> <p>  Respite needs to be made more formal and planned better.  I know many people who have to fight to get respite every time.  They may be going on holidays in June but they are offered the respite in July.  Perhaps under the new scheme there could be a more formal arrangement with regard to respite.<\/p> <p>  At present, home care and the home help hours seem to be for morning and evening only.  It is a one-size-fits-all arrangement.  Informal carers can often manage mornings and evenings themselves but may need help during the middle of the day.

I presume that in some cases more than one person is being cared for in a particular situation.<\/p> <p>  People often talk, rightly, about the amount of money that is saved for the State as a result of the work of unpaid informal carers.  It is also relevant with regard to people receiving carer's allowance when one considers the amount of that allowance compared with what it would cost to provide full-time care in a nursing home or were we to apply the cost on an hour-by-hour caring basis.  A vast amount of money is being saved to the State.  That is not the only point.  The great desire of people to be cared for in their own homes and to live in their own homes for as long as possible is relevant as well.  It is wrong to think of it purely in money terms.  However, it is important that the State would always have in mind the value been given to the State by these people working in the home.  Do the officials have an estimate for the value?  What metric does the Department use?  Given the figure on the number of carers, how does the Department measure the value they give to the State in financial terms?  What is the estimate of that value?  Is the carer's allowance subtracted from the potential cost of full-time nursing home care?  Do we simply look at the difference?  How is it measured?

Every euro invested in home care is money that can be spent on where people want to be for as long as possible, which is in their own homes.  If Scotland spends double what we spend does it mean there is a corresponding increase in the provision of the service or is it that they just provide more hours while having less in the way of informal caring or a lower dependence on carers allowance?  A lot of people get carers allowance but many do not and if those people were to declare a one-day strike, this country would come to a complete standstill.

It is not focused on residential care but on preventing hospital admissions.  Money is being moved from the hospitals to the home care service.  It is about providing more complex care for people.  Big losers in this process, from what we read, were the people who required a small number of hours of home care.  We might not want to follow this.  Those people's hours are being moved to care in cases more typically found in a hospital or nursing home.  We need to be careful not to just do everything everybody else does but to think about what we will do.  We could, by not providing the small number of hours, actually make people's situation worse and increase hospital admissions that we would want to decrease later.

Our mission is to achieve fundamental change in the lives of all older people by eliminating age discrimination, promoting positive ageing and securing their right to comprehensive and high quality services. <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet you this morning and acknowledge the efforts of Minister of State at the Department of Health Deputy Jim Daly, who has responsibility for older people and his predecessor the then Minister of State at the Department of Health<b><\/b>and now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Helen McEntee in bringing forward the public consultation on how we can develop a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services.  I acknowledge and thank the officials from the Department of Health when they referred to the extension of that consultation, which was something that Age Action and a number of other organisations had requested.<br\/><br\/>Goal 3 of the National Positive Ageing Strategy states that it is the policy of the Government to &ldquo;Enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible&rdquo;.  <font color=\"#212100\">Every political party and elected representative we have met have told us they support this.  Yet despite this political will, we have developed a system that drives older people into long-term care prematurely and that treats home care supports more as a way to empty acute hospital beds than to enable an older person to age at home with dignity and independence.<\/font><br\/><br\/>In Ireland, we spend 1% of our total healthcare expenditure on preventative care, significantly less than other European countries.  The current policy of prioritising the provision of home care packages to facilitate discharge from acute hospitals means older people in hospital can access them more easily than those in the community.  This makes it harder for older people in the community to have their care needs met and, as we heard a few moments ago, it is a false economy.  Frail older people who are denied home care have higher rates of admission to acute hospitals, while those who get the support they need see a fall in the number of hospital admissions. <br\/><br\/>The HSE Planning for Health 2017 report calculated that 50,875 people should be in receipt of home help in 2017.  However, as indicated in Table 1 of the submission to members, the number of home help hours provided remained at 2016 levels.  These figures reflect home help provided to all care groups.  A HSE performance report in 2009 estimated that 85% off recipients were older people.  Using this figure, it is estimated that fewer than 42,000 older people receive home help, approximately 6.5% of the population aged 65 and over. <br\/><br\/>When set against the OECD estimate that 10.1 % of people aged 65 and over need home care this suggests approximately 22,000 older people in Ireland are not getting the support they need.  Evidence of this unmet need is apparent in the community.  An evaluation of the piloting of the single assessment tool indicated that of 534 fair deal applicants discharged from acute hospitals, 41%, or 219 patients, were not in receipt of home support services prior to admission.<br\/><br\/>The numbers waiting for home help are increasing.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2016, 2,039 people were assessed as needing home help but waiting for a service.  By the end of April of this year, the number of people who were waiting had increased by more than 20% to 2,456.  As Senator Mullen said earlier, there are major regional disparities within these figures.  A total of 554 people in the community health organisation area 9 were awaiting home help at the end of December 2016, whereas no one was awaiting home help in community health organisation area 7.  People who are waiting for hours to become available can be obliged to wait until a client dies or moves into a nursing home.  A social worker who was interviewed as part of a research study - Meeting Older People&rsquo;s Preference for Care, which was highlighted by Senator Kelleher earlier - confirmed that \"often the situation is that you are waiting for someone to die to access hours\".  The reality is that home help hours and home care packages are simply not available in many parts of the country.  As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony indicated, we repeatedly hear about this issue from Deputies who are dealing with their constituents.  When more older people are forced into nursing homes unnecessarily, families struggle to cope without home helps and more pressure is piled on family carers who are already being put to the pin of their collars.  We welcome the additional home care funding that was announced by the Government in last month&rsquo;s budget.  We look forward to seeing this make a real difference in reducing the number of people who are waiting for services.<\/p><p> A flexible and person-centred approach to the provision of home care services is needed to meet the specific needs of the individual, the carer and the wider health society.  We need a rights-based statutory model for the delivery of home care.  If people are to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as is their right under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, home care must move from a selective model in which services are allocated at the discretion of local management in each community health organisation area to a universal model that is underpinned by rights.  In this context, we expect the State to continue to be the main provider of home help and home care services and to function as the bedrock of the home care system.  While older people should have a choice of providers, it is critical that the State does not seek to abdicate its responsibility for ensuring all public and private providers meet certain minimum standards.  We welcome the comments from the departmental officials earlier today about their commitment to ensuring there is proper regulation of home care.  A statutory entitlement to care allows older people to claim their rights and steers policy and resources towards the State's legal responsibilities.  Home care services underpinned by legislation can address the absence of any rigorous monitoring, regulation or quality standards.  We must change how we think about long-term care.  Long-term care should be recognised as a public good, rather than as an individual responsibility.  As the number of older people in Ireland is set to continue to rise in the coming years, we have an opportunity to put in place a system that provides a continuum of care for our older citizens and integrates home care with primary and community services and, where necessary, nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  We look forward to working with the members of the committee to make all of this a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I invite Professor O'Shea to address the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#N00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I will focus primarily on the economics and financing of long-term care.  The key point I want to make is that regulation and legislation are not enough unless they are accompanied by adequate resources.  In recent years, adequate resources have not been provided in support of the long-term care we need.  This is particularly true in the case of home care.  If we are serious about changing the structure and the system of care, we have to find some way to provide the resources to do that.  We have been really good at policy and the rhetoric of policy.  Our vision for what we want, as set out in reports like the Care of the Aged report from 1966 and the The Years Ahead report from 1977 and in various strategies, including the recent dementia strategy, could not be faulted.  The implementation aspect relating to that could be faulted, however.  I think that is the key to change in the coming years.  The key pressure among the numerous pressures that are coming on the system is demography, which will change the landscape over the next ten or 20 years.  We have been seeing it coming, but it is arriving now.  It will be a key game-changer in the context of the resource question.  This is the fundamental area I want to talk about today.<br\/><br\/>Various countries take differing approaches to the key question of where the locus of responsibility with respect to care should lie.  The Nordic countries, for example, tend to favour large Government spending on the welfare state.  Countries in southern Europe tend to rely on family care.  Where do we lie?  Where is the locus of responsibility in Ireland in the context of care provision?  <i>De facto<\/i>, it is with families.  Families provide the main bulk of care.  When a monetary value is put on the care that is provided in the area of dementia, in which I work, it is found that almost half of the cost of care is borne by families.  <i>De facto<\/i>, care is borne by families.  We do not have much data on preferences.  Some 60% of the 100 members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that families should have primary responsibility in this regard and the State should provide strong supports.  One third of members of the Citizens' Assembly said that the State should bear the primary responsibility for care, with family support.  Interestingly, 87% of members of the Citizens' Assembly agreed that more spending is needed.  Regardless of whether one thinks the State should provide more or families should provide more, there is agreement that not enough is being provided.  <i>De facto<\/i>, carers provide care.<br\/><br\/>I would like to speak about one of the things that have been happening in the home care area in recent years.  This has been going on for a while.  We have not managed to get sufficient resources.  When we have had financial difficulties, the first thing we have done is cut back on community care services.  One of the reasons for this is that community services are easier than other services to cut back, or not increase.  That is what has happened in recent years.  If one divides total expenditure by this country's total population of older people - I am talking about the number of people over the age of 65, rather than the total number of dependent older people - one will find that spending has decreased by approximately &euro;1,000 <i>per capita<\/i>over the past eight years.  I am not saying that all of those over the age of 65 are depending on the State because of course they are not.  The broad figure I have mentioned gives an indication that it is easier to decide not to fund community care services - we sometimes do this unwittingly - than it is to cut back on residential care services because there is a statutory element to services in the latter category.  It is also difficult to cut back in the areas of pay and so on.  We tend not to support fragmented community care services for these reasons.  We need a statutory home care system because it will give people certainty in these respects.<br\/><br\/>One of the enduring criticisms of Government policy in respect of dependent older people is the imbalance between residential care and community-based care.  I am not arguing that we should cut back on residential care, which is needed for some older people.  There is no question of this being a case of one or the other.  We need to give more support to people in community-based care.  At the moment, the balance of care is fragmented and unequal.  I would say there is inequality of home care provision across the country.  One can be lucky or unlucky, depending on where one lives.  It is sometimes more difficult in rural areas.  Similarly, there can be difficulties in the community care systems in urban areas.  The community care systems we have are very narrow.  They tend to focus on home help, which is important and critical, but there are many other things that older people want, which is a question I want to focus on.  At present, we tend to determine community-based care on the basis of what suppliers and health care and social care providers think older people want.  I suggest we need to move towards a personalised care system that responds to the expressed needs and preferences of older people.  Older people and people with dementia have a voice.  They know their own care needs and preferences.  We should be able to respond to them in a very personalised way.  This is not just a question of rights.  The emphasis should not be on home care only.  We need personalised home care.  We need a variety of responses.  The focus should not be solely on the provision of more home help hours, although that is important.  We need to think about psychosocial responses.  We need to think about connecting dependent older people in the communities where they live.  It is not good enough just to provide care.  We must connect.  We make people who are invisible visible in their own communities so that they can live good lives.  This is a critical point in any discussion on the development of home care services.  While expanding rights to community-based care is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one.<\/p><p>We need to think about what kind of services we have.<\/p><p> That brings me to the final point I want to talk about, which is funding.  Funding for long-term care here in Ireland has typically come from general taxation.  There are good reasons we use general taxation to fund care.  General taxation is universal.  It is democratically accountable.  It yields a large amount of money and it tends to be progressive.  However, dependent older people have lost out.  General taxation does not trickle down to where we want those resources for older people.  In particular, it does not trickle down to flexible, responsive, personalised community-based care.  If we simply legislate for more home care and rights, unless we address the funding issue we will not change very much.  That means we could opt to allocate more resources.  I do not mean allocate willy-nilly as one has to evaluate what is good and what is bad in care.  This is not simply a case of allocation for the sack of it.  There are alternatives.  An alternative option which I spoke about probably 20 years ago was discussed ten or 15 years ago.  Some countries, such as Japan and German, use designated social insurance funding for long-term care.  Under a social insurance system, people would pay into a fund and in return would get an automatic entitlement.  I will not go into how one would create that system, but it is a social insurance system.  Such a system would allow for a more protected, and, if we want, designated, visible transparent community-based care system where we could say what we have, what we allocate and what is the impact of that.<\/p><p> When we last discussed this, for example, in the four years between 2002 and 2006 when we were coming up to the fair deal legislation, we as a society felt it would be too costly, it might impact on competitiveness and it might impact on labour markets.  We wondered would it be seen as an additional form of taxation.  I believe there are significant advantages to a social insurance system and it, along with rights-based community-based care, needs to be part of the debate over the coming years.  It works well in Germany and Japan.  If we do not think about changing the structure of funding, we need to ensure that taxation gets allocated and trickles down to where we want it.<\/p><p> I would again say that rights without resources for community-based care will not achieve what we want it to achieve.  Therefore, if we want to develop high-quality services, if we want to shift the balance where the onus of care is primarily on families, we need to think about what we are thinking about now, which is rights, but we need to do more.  We need to think about rights for a rich variety of services for older people.  We need to think about rights for a visible equitable system of care for older people.  We need to shift the balance from residential to community, although keeping strong residential care services, and we need to think about having the older person, the person with dementia, right at the centre of that decision-making process.  Then we would have a credible home care system for an increasing demography that will put considerable pressure over the next ten years on this society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Shea.

The NCCN represents 26 not-for-profit home care providers across the country and as we have submitted a briefing document also, I will focus on a few key points.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for all stakeholders involved in home care provision is how to satisfy and sustain the growing need for the service.  We know that keeping older persons at home has benefits for clients, their families and the State.  Living and being cared for at home gives the older person a sense of independence and dignity and lets him or her remain part of the community.  It is also the least expensive option.<\/p> <p>  Historically, the provision of the home care service by community providers was carried out on an almost voluntary basis.  Today the sector is funded by the HSE, which itself is a direct home care provider, and contracted out to the private and not-for-profit home care companies.  The sector is changing rapidly and not necessarily for the better, as the various home care providers compete for business.  The commissioning or tendering process, which was expected by some to decrease costs and increase value for money, has to date resulted in increased costs and reduced hours of care due to a relatively stagnant budget.  The move to diminish home help funding in favour of more complex home care packages has delayed home care interventions, with the result that older persons now present with more complex needs, require a higher allocation of hours upon engaging with the service and see earlier hospital admissions, all leading to an increased demand for costly long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  The terms and conditions of the 2016 tender resulted in varying standards of care and significant inconsistencies in its implementation across the nine CHOs.  The phasing out of grant funding to community home care providers will definitely drive some out of business.  With decreased numbers of providers, client choice is significantly compromised.<\/p> <p>  The current situation simply breeds uncertainty and insecurity, and has resulted in the sector being less attractive to potential carers.  The recruitment to and retention of persons in the home care profession is undoubtedly the single biggest challenge for all providers and unless there is a serious intervention, we are heading for a major tsunami.<\/p> <p>  NCCN members have a long history in community home care, some with up to 50 years of experience in the sector.  These providers are community based, and have a proven track record of caring for the more vulnerable in our society.  Like any business we need funding to function, but the primary focus of the NCCN is on client care not profitability.  NCCN members are determined to remain at the forefront of home care delivery in Ireland and have fully engaged with the Health Service Executive when invited to do so.  The NCCN is not against change, but feels strongly that we should be afforded the opportunity to be part of the process.  Although client care is our primary objective, NCCN members are in business.  Unlike the private or State providers, our members are subject to even more governance and compliance issues by the Charities Regulatory Authority, CRA, in addition to the Companies Registration Office, CRO, Revenue, and the various service level agreements with funders.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN has from the outset strongly advocated for regulation and common standards across all home care providers, both private and statutory.  We want all home care providers to be accredited in the interests of health and safety of both clients and staff.  We advocate for a social clause in all e-tendering procedures.  Our contention is that early intervention is critical and residential care is not inevitable.  Our primary objective is to work towards keeping older persons at home, but this is dependent on the availability of carers and care hours.  Funding should predominantly be by the State but should not exclude the possibility of a client contribution.  The continuity of care would involve working with primary care teams, including GPs and the public health nurses.  More could be achieved by better integration with other services, such as day centres, meals on wheels and other community organisations like active retired, Age Friendly, Age Action, etc.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN is committed to research and the promotion of technologies that would facilitate home care delivery, client monitoring and safety, but current demands of compliance with all those bodies referenced, the CRO, CRA and Revenue, need to be streamlined because the burden of compliance is significant.  In isolation, funding increases will do little to attract more persons into the home care sector.  If a carer works the shortest call, which is normally 30 minutes, he or she forfeits any entitlement to a social welfare payment for the remainder of that day.  Under such circumstances, there is no incentive to work in that sector.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN has lobbied for a change to Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments based on hours per day to hours per week.  This would require a co-operation across two Departments, namely Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Health.  To date there has not been any obvious political will to effect such a change.  Although there is a need for increased funding to the sector, the recruitment and retention of carers is currently the single biggest challenge to the service.  The committee has a unique opportunity to positively influence the future of home care in the interests of our older persons and an ageing population.  I hope that the committee does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fiacre Hensey"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I have a number of short questions.  Unfortunately, I will have to leave for a couple of minutes so Deputy Durkan will take the Chair.  I will ask my questions and will have an opportunity to read back on the answers in the Official Report.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran talked about the need to maintain standards and how important they are, and I do not think anyone would disagree with that.  Can Mr. Moran comment on whether he believes those standards are being maintained effectively at the moment?  What could be done, even in the short term, to improve things?  We all talk about our ageing population, which is marvellous.  We would all like to grow old in safety and comfort and know that somebody is monitoring those standards.  While we appreciate the evidence from the HSE and the Department of Health about what might happen in future, perhaps Mr. Moran could indicate what could happen in the very short term to ensure those standards are maintained.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea referred to something very interesting, which Mr. Moran might talk about as well, which is what older people want.  We are discussing what they might want in terms of regulation.  Is there a forum other than through representative groups for older persons to feed directly into the system?  If we become more corporatised and move further away from the community base, will the opportunity for older persons to feed into that process be lost?<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the representatives from the NCCN about the difficulty in sourcing home help hours between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., which the representatives from the Department of Health referred to earlier.  They said it is sometimes necessary to go to the private sector to source those hours.  I have said already I have some experience of that.  My experience of dealing with home helps is of them telling me they cannot get enough hours and that they are available to do the work.  Will the witnesses comment on the capacity issue and the ability for a client to top up hours, which was mentioned in the opening remarks of the representatives of the NCCN?  Will they elaborate on exactly what that is?  It is my understanding that when a person has been allocated a certain number of hours, which are paid for by the HSE, the person or his or her family may be able to top those hours up.  If the witnesses excuse me, I have to go but I will be back.

My first question is to Professor Eamon O'Shea.  He commented clearly that rights and regulations without adequate resources are meaningless and will not create certainty and personalised care.  When we ask older people and people with dementia or other care needs what they want, they say they do not want a one-size-fits all solution.  They want the kind of care that fits their circumstances and in the case of dementia, that changes.  When one gets a diagnosis of dementia, one can be very fit and well.  One might need a little bit of help or a reminder to eat, for example, but it can progress.  That kind of personalised care needs to change with the person's needs.<\/p> <p>  I want to hone in on the social insurance model.  Given that the Department of Health is now working up its scheme, what advice would Professor O'Shea give us to advise the Department of Health on the resourcing of home care?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran said there is political will for the development of home care but there is still massive unmet need.  We heard from the Department of Health earlier that it thinks it might be two to three years before a regulatory regime can be introduced.  My husband works for HIQA - not as an inspector - which may be in the frame so I should probably raise that.  What would Mr. Moran ask the committee to say to the Department of Health given there is political will and huge unmet need?  There is also a sense of urgency so that the two-year to three-year timeframe seems far out.  <\/p> <p>  What would Mr. Hensey ask the committee to deliver to the Department of Health in terms of its ongoing deliberations on home care?

Home help and provision of care for the elderly is a huge problem right across the country but it is a particular problem in rural Ireland.  I accept that home help is not the only care that needs to be provided.  Between 2009 and 2010, in one year alone, 32,000 hours of home help were cut in County Mayo.  There was not a problem in the provision of home care at that time but the decision was made for it to be cut.  We were told it would not have any impact on the services provided.  Elderly people are being medically assessed as needing home care and it is not being provided.  The people on the ground do not have the resources to provide it and it is a huge problem.  There has been an increase in the budget but despite that extra allocation in the budget, it is still not working.  People are being assessed but are not getting the care required.<\/p> <p>  The hope that funding would trickle down has been mentioned.  We can talk about this endlessly but we have to remember that older people who need this care, in some cases people who are 99 years of age, are not getting the care they need.  It is a shame on all of us that it is not happening.  There are people in their 80s and 90s trying to care for other people in their 80s and 90s and they are not able to do it.  The impact it is having on their physical and mental health as carers is astounding and is completely wrong.  <\/p> <p>  The other problem is in the provision of care and the availability of carers.  There are some parishes that have no care available.  One of the solutions to that is to revert back to the provision of one hour of care.  The result is we have been telling elderly people they are not even worth one hour of home care, which is wrong.  Can the witnesses see that happening?  Can we force the Government to reverse the situation so that people get one hour?  Forget about the 30 minutes or 45 minutes nonsense of people running across rural parishes trying to provide care - we cannot expect people to do that and to sit into their cars and drive for 30 minutes.  <\/p> <p>  The witness was right when he spoke about connecting people.  How can a person providing care to people in their own homes connect with people when the basic essentials have to be done in 30 minutes?  It is not possible for any human being to do that.  It concerns me that while we have all the right words for providing care for people in their own homes and it is our policy, we do not have the funding.  It should not be a case of the funding trickling down; it should be there and not somewhere else waiting for a hand down.  It should be there within communities to provide home care once the medical assessment is made that it is needed.  I do not want to wait another number of years for that to happen.  It is a decision that could and should be made immediately.  When the assessment is done, the home care should be provided.  I empathise with the people in home help offices who are trying to provide this care.<\/p><p>They are listening to families and must hear their stories every day of the week.  The impact on them as workers trying to provide this care is totally wrong.  We need the funding for it, not just the fancy words.  I accept that it can be provided in different ways, but it was a major policy mistake to privatise what was already working.  I would never advise going backwards, but we must go back and look at the models that were in place before all these drastic cuts started.  Where is the money going?  If people are saying all this money is being provided, where is it going in the system?  It is not going to the 99 year old who is desperately waiting for help to get out of bed in the morning and so forth.  People in rural areas are hugely dependent on proper home care.  This is happening alongside half of the beds being cut in the local community hospital, so people do not have the respite and supports that were available heretofore.  There must be an absolute urgency on that.<\/p><p> However, I am asking the witness about the one hour.  Can the witness see if this business of 30 minutes and 45 minutes can be abolished?  What would it take to do away with that as a policy decision across the board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#P00600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and speakers.  Perhaps they could give us some assistance on the figures for all of this with regard to the demographics and where they are going, if possible.  We heard earlier that there are approximately 195,000 people giving care at an average of 38 hours per week.  It is approximately 6.6 million hours of care.  There is a larger number receiving care.  In some cases, there will be a second person being given care by the same person and, of course, there are people living alone who are receiving home help services to a greater or lesser degree from outside.  Within that figure of 195,000 carers there are informal carers and those receiving some class of care allowance.  I said earlier that money is not the primary lens through which this issue should be viewed, but the witnesses have made it clear that there is no reality to our aspirations and vision unless the resources are in place.  Is there an overall figure?<\/p> <p>  I realise it is a difficult thing to assess and that there might be different metrics.  I asked the officials earlier if they had a figure but they were not in a position to give me one.  That is fair enough, but the State ought to be in a position to estimate how much carers are saving the State through the work they do.  Whether their work is completely informal and not remunerated or one takes into account the carer's allowance they receive, it is far less than it would cost the State to give that full-time care however one measures it, be it in the context of nursing home costs or factoring in an hour-by-hour cost of giving care.  Can the witnesses help us by giving us a sense of how much carers are saving the State, to put it in those terms?<\/p> <p>  Linking that to what Professor O'Shea spoke about regarding the demographics, the rubber is going to hit the road in a much more intense way in the future than is the case at present.  Where are we going in terms of the demographics by 2030, 2040 and 2050 relative to where we are now?  The witnesses are recommending a social insurance system for the funding of all that.  Could they outline what they see as the benefits of that?  Is it to do with the ring-fencing, that if there is a social insurance system the money paid by taxpayers in that way is therefore ring-fenced for spending on care, be it home care or residential?  Are the witnesses thinking of it specifically for community-based care?  I presume that is the case.<\/p> <p>  I realise there is a great deal covered by those questions.  I agree on the need for personalised and responsive services.  I and my family are very involved in a care giving situation and one hears about other people's experiences.  My mother told me recently about a conversation she had with another carer who was informed by the person coming in, with the best will in the world, that they do not do this, that or the other.  Eventually the lady asked in frustration, \"Well, what do you do?\"  Everybody's needs are different, so I empathise with that comment because it brought that thought back to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#Q00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing and the support they have given through the years with regard to elderly care.  I am approaching this from the perspective of trying to fast-track the changes we need.  As I said earlier, I brought forward a legislative measure in 2012 in a Private Member's capacity and it is only now in place, five years later, so I was trying to tie down a timeframe for when we would see the change from the Department and the HSE with regard to the provision of home care.  We are talking about two to three years.  It is important that we try to give every assistance possible to the Department and the HSE to bring that timeline of two to three years forward.<\/p> <p>  With regard to home care, I wish to follow up on what Senator Conway-Walsh raised regarding rural areas where there are insufficient numbers of people available.  It is a huge challenge and it will be an even greater challenge in the next ten years.  There are a number of reasons for that, one of which is the increasing number of elderly people in rural areas.  More people are coming into that category.  On the other side, there is the economic upturn.  Whereas previously people might have been available to provide home care,  they are now not available to provide it.  There are two challenges in that regard.  One of my concerns is whether we have an adequate number of people going through the training process at present to be available to provide home care and how we can incentivise that.<\/p> <p>  If we get more people to provide home care, there will be a huge saving for the State in real terms.  The expenditure on somebody in a nursing home is approximately &euro;50,000 per annum or approximately &euro;1,000 per week, whether it comes from the patient or the State.  Home care, therefore, is not even one third of that if it can be provided adequately whereby people can stay in their own home.  We must incentivise the provision of home care and incentivise the people who could be encouraged to come into it.  Has that issue been considered?  For example, should we consider a scheme whereby for somebody who is providing home care the first &euro;15,000 of their income, if it comes from the provision of home care, would be exempt from tax.  Has something like that been considered, particularly in view of the challenges we are facing now?  With the economic upturn, it will become increasingly difficult to get people to take on this role.<\/p> <p>  I have seen this working successfully.  For example, I know somebody who is in their mid-90s and is confined to a wheelchair.  The person is living alone and as a result of the home care being provided, which is through a combination of her family and the HSE, she is living independently and has a far better way of life than if she was in a nursing home.  That is not to criticise nursing homes.  They provide a very good level of care as well.  However, that lady is far happier and I am sure there are many others in a similar situation.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is older people who are afraid to allow anybody to get in involved in providing care for them, even though they need the care.  I have encountered a number of such instances recently involving people in their 90s who have a mistrust.  In fairness, the community nurse, the community garda and everyone is involved, but we have still failed to get them to accept that home care is the way forward for them.<\/p><p>How would one deal with a situation like that and make progress on such an issue?  I thank Mr. Moran for the work he is doing in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#Q00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>I have a couple of comments rather than questions.  I used to be involved in the health board in the old days and we used to visit all the nursing homes or, as they were called then, segregated hospitals.  One point that comes to my attention all the time is the need for a standardised system that is interdependent and backed up with home help, home care, respite care and access to nursing homes, as required.  This lightens the load on the household and carer and recognises that many carers are caring over their lifetime.  Very often, a mother caring for a child with special needs has heavy responsibilities, including nursing responsibilities, and this can be the case into old age.  This creates obvious serious physical problems for the carer.<\/p> <p>  Community-based social interaction is important.  The person who receives care in the home or elsewhere should be able to meet others and have a chat.  It is a little more difficult in rural areas but it can be done.  The number of community centres might not be as high.  A trip to the pub or elsewhere, for a special outing or otherwise, contributes to the quality of life that the older person should expect.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea stated the patient knows best in any event.  Nobody feels the burden like the patient, for two reasons.  First, the patient feels he is a burden, which creates a further problem in itself.  Second, the patient knows how he feels and what needs to be done to address his issues.  If the patient gets the impression that nobody understands his position or cares, it presents a huge burden in itself, and it creates a huge problem for people in the older age group.  I am mindful of the fact that I am approaching the age group in question, with a certain amount of caution.<\/p> <p>  The transport element is important.  There are a number of rural transport groups up and running throughout the country.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has quite extensive services in some areas, but not throughout the country to the extent needed.  Services exist, however, and clearly demonstrate the quality of service that can be provided when there are dedicated individuals to offer it.  All the services that are needed, to a greater extent among older people, ought to be provided in the same way, as is required, and as they would be offered in an institutional environment.  If they do not receive the services, it will create further problems. <\/p> <p>  I was involved in the provision of services previously in the old nursing homes, old hospitals, district hospitals, etc.  This was before there was any direct provision for the private nursing homes.  There was a considerable controversy over the old age pension.  It was ceded to the hospital or nursing home, generating much criticism.  When that stopped, the whole system became very much more expensive.  I have thought about it in the meantime.  At least the old system, which may be archaic by our standards today, provided residential care of a very good standard at a time when there were very few other services available for older people.<\/p> <p>  Some 85% of citizens are older people.  This is interesting but it is no harm to remember that there is a growing cohort of younger people.  Immigrants have generally been younger people.  There is a significant cohort of younger people who will be taxpayers into the future.  The imbalance that exists will not be as great as in some other European countries.  We will be compensated in that way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#R00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I am really sorry but I must leave as I have another group coming.

When the Chairman asked how we maintain standards, the first word that came to my mind, and which was raised by Senator Burke, was \"training\".  This is an area in which the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has done some work with home care workers, highlighting some of the challenges they face.  Some challenges concern employment issues and zero-hour contracts.  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the issue of people hurtling across the country to try to deliver even 15 minutes of home care and then hurtling away somewhere else.  What could be done?  We could try to support training for home care workers, particularly as an increasing number of people with increasingly complex needs will be at home.  We have come across care workers being put in a position where they are being asked to do things they do not believe they are fully trained or able for.  I do not have figures for the Irish context in this regard.  In our research, we came across an NHS briefing paper that highlighted that 60% of the NHS training budget went towards what could be described as the most highly skilled professionals, including doctors and nurses.  Not nearly as much money went to the care workers, the health care assistants and people providing hands-on care.<\/p> <p>  With regard to maintaining and improving standards right now, the issue of training is critical.  This relates to the point Senator Conway-Walsh raised on the limited amount of time available.  If one has 15 or 30 minutes in which to get somebody up in the morning, there is no chance of building a relationship with that person.  It can also be quite harassing for the older person.  One has to get that person into the shower and usher them along the whole time.  This can be quite pressurised.  We need to do more to support workers and improve the process for the recruitment and retention of care workers to ensure caring is seen as a valid career path with training and professional development.  If we can achieve this, and if the care workers have the time to deliver the service, we will see standards increase, as referred to by the Chairman.  As I stated, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has done work on this.  I highly recommend it to the committee. <\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Kelleher's point on political will and the period of two to three years, obviously we would prefer to see progress made sooner but we would prefer the job to be done right more than anything else.  If it takes two to three years to develop a statutory scheme for home care that is effective and deals with the issues highlighted by the other members of the committee, that can be lived with, as long as it is not pushed on further.  That is the medium to long-term solution.  The crisis in home care is happening now.  This was raised a couple of times by people talking about their experience of constituents coming to them and the question of how serious it is gaining access to home care. <\/p> <p>  When I talk about the political will expressed in comments of politicians and political parties suggesting they support home care, I always regard the October budget as the real representation of political will.  Maybe this is a little cynical.  The budget shows where money goes and does not go.  Professor O'Shea, who was talking about budgeting earlier, was highlighting that, in general, based on taxation, which is how we are providing funding at present, we have seen community care cut back.  To have greater representation of political will, as raised by Senator Kelleher, we would like to see more money invested in home care supports and home help hours.  We would also like to have further clarity regarding where the money is going.  Senator Conway-Walsh raised this.  As I said in my presentation, there are very wide differences between community health organisations.  The average member of the public could not tell one what a community health organisation is but, depending on which side of this CHO boundary one meets, one could get the care one needs.  If one is on the other side, one does not get it at all.  Although the money is going to the CHOs, it is a question of how it is being spent.  It would be great to achieve clarity on that.   If there is something the committee could focus on seriously while we are working on making progress on the statutory scheme, in addition to funding and transparency over funding, it is the expansion of reablement programmes.  Three or four years ago in north Dublin, the HSE carried out a pilot study on reablement.<\/p><p>I could be wrong, but I believe that approximately 200 older people in acute hospitals were assessed as needing home help hours.  Instead of getting home help hours, they went through a six-week reablement programme with very intensive supports, including occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  It was like teaching the person how to live independently again.  When the reablement programme had concluded, 80% of those older people were assessed as needing either no home help hours or fewer hours.  The programme has also being rolled out in Glasgow and there is a very good case study, which we highlighted in our pre-budget submission on health.  We have a successful HSE pilot programme in north Dublin.  Could this be expanded and run on a national basis to see whether we can deliver reablement and, as a result of this, reduce demand for home help hours and free up resources?<\/p><p> I have addressed Senator Conway-Walsh's points on the issues of time and where the money is going, and the need for social interaction raised by the Acting Chairman.  To go back to Senator Mullen's point, perhaps my colleagues have better information on the number of carers.  The participation of organisations such as Family Carers Ireland and Care Alliance would be very important in the committee's deliberations and in the context of its work.  They would be able to deliver a very informed perspective on it.  Senator Mullen spoke about the experience of a carer coming in and stating that this is what he or she does and this is what he or she does not do.<\/p><p> Funding is critical.  We support lot of the arguments made by Professor O'Shea, but what are we paying for?  Earlier, a departmental official said people are willing to make contributions but for what are they making contributions?  What do we mean by a statutory home care scheme?  What does it actually mean?  Is it home help hours or home care?  What is the role of assistive technology?  Will it deal with personal care or household tasks?  We definitely need to deal with the issue of funding because if we do not, we will end up with a statutory scheme that delivers nothing.<\/p><p> We also need to develop a very clear idea that when we use the phrase \"home care\" everybody in this room and everybody applying for it has a very clear idea of what it actually means.  For example, a standard home care basket, whatever that might be, might be free, but contributions might be paid for personal care services.  This was being discussed as one of the Health Research Board's comparisons.  I am a 39 year old man.  If, in three years' time, I am told I must start paying a social insurance contribution towards long-term care, I would not have a problem with it.  However, I would really like to know what I will get when I reach the age when I will be looking for that long-term care.  Something that has always struck me is when consultation for the statutory home care scheme was announced and launched by the Department, all of the coverage in the newspapers the next day was about payments, how it will be paid for, whether it would be means tested and whether there would be co-payments or contributions.  These are critical parts of the discussion, but we also need to know what we will pay for as well is how we will pay for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>There are lots of questions and I will try to weave in answers to them rather than-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>Professor O'Shea should give it his best shot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>There are several really good elements and it is important to say what they are.  A strong sense of intergenerational solidarity exists in the country.  We are not starting from a base where we do not have willingness or a commitment of support.  Whether this is through care, through families caring, through contributions or through our social insurance system, there is a strong element of solidarity.  In recent years, we have had really good examples of where personalised care is working.  There have been a number of innovations, particularly for people with dementia, throughout the country.  There are programmes in Mayo, south Tipperary, south Dublin and Kinsale in Cork.  There are many interesting projects.  We are not starting from a zero base with regard to personalised care.  We know older people and their families like this.  There are good models in terms of what we want to do.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of the demographic changes that will happen.  At present, 55,000 people have dementia and they require various levels of care on a continuum.  We know this will increase to approximately 100,000 by 2026 and up to 150,000 over the next 15 years.  We know it will double and treble in the foreseeable future.  This is not decades away.  This is a good example of how numbers should concentrate minds.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to know for sure how many carers we have looking after older people and the number of hours they do.  From the limited surveys we have done, we estimate there are approximately 60,000 carers of people with dementia, ranging from cognitive impairment to advanced dementia.  Many of these carers provide hours of care in terms of work we would shy away from in the formal paid labour market.  Very often it is alone and debilitating, and very often shocks happen in the system of care to which there is not an immediate response and people are left even more vulnerable.  These numbers have meaning.  They are not just numbers or estimates, they have real meaning.  What does this mean for a personalised, person-centred base in terms of the provision of supports and where do older people fit in?  Whether they are physically or cognitively dependent, the voices of older people must be central.  We cannot run a system where it is supply-side driven and provider-driven with an \"I know best\" approach.  We will not get the connectivity or the social model of production where people are integrated and visible and we have an equitable provision throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked as to how we get this voice.  There are good things happening in this regard.  We have the Irish dementia working group, associated with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, and we hear directly from people with dementia.  We need to hear the direct voice in various fora and the policymakers need to hear it.  We need champions, and that refers to this building and this group.  We need champions, and not just the advocacy groups who are champions in their own right.  We need political champions.  If we look at countries where there has been political championing of older people's issues there has been an impact in the policy-making process.  Over the coming years, it would be very helpful if there was direct championing of these issues in the political process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>I do not mean to push Professor O'Shea, but we must be somewhere else very shortly.

This goes back to the question of home help hours and half hours.  Basic humanity is the essence of person-centred care.  It cannot be done in half an hour or an hour.  It has to be consistent and reliable.  It has to be based on knowledge of the person.  These are essentials of a home care system.  When people speak about a home care system in terms of just hours, they should not miss the fundamental relationships that are critical to the care process.  These underpin the care process.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of charging and cost sharing, we need to be careful about having cost sharing for community-based care.  If we believe home care is the optimal approach, the introduction of cost sharing may incentivise the very opposite of what we want to happen.

All providers provide care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  In that regard, most of our organisations are reliant on core funding from the HSE, which historically was for the provision of care in the morning Monday to Friday and typically for early intervention care through what were originally domestic type duties.  During the years that has changed to personal care which everybody in receipt of care from our organisations now receives.  However, we very strongly advocate that the committee consider early intervention care and its effectiveness in keeping people at home, thus reducing the number of hospital admissions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly also asked about clients having the ability to top up the care they received that was provided and paid for by the HSE.  Unfortunately, our organisations are currently unable to provide private top-up paid care.

One good measure which has come from the past couple of tenders is the stipulation that carers should have formal qualifications.  That began in the 2014 tender process, whereby one was obliged to have completed two FETAC level 5 modules.  That increased to eight modules but was then reduced in the 2016 tender process.  There is an inconsistency, but things have been done.  Many of our members or carers have completed eight care modules, which is a significant qualification.  Like the other delegates, we would welcome regulation, but we should not flog ourselves to death for not doing anything because we have done quite a lot.  I reluctantly accept that it takes two or three years to come up with a regulation, policy or whatever else, but there are issues that can be progressed in spite of formal regulations not being in place.  That will need will and co-operation.  We are endeavouring to co-operate with the HSE in various fora to advance things, in spite of regulations not being in place.<\/p> <p>  There has been a crossover in the questions asked.  I reiterate that the availability of carers is the biggest problem across the country in the delivery of home care services.  We do not like to call ourselves a voluntary organisation because people then think we do everything for free.  Recruitment is crucial for not-for-profit organisations, private companies or more acute business models and the State which is a provider of care through the HSE, but it is currently very difficult for it to take place.  I have given the committee the solution and would like to think it has the power to approach the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Health in that regard.  If we do not move on this issue, it will not matter how much money we put into it.  We need to make it an area in which people can work.<\/p> <p>  On the nature of care, as Mr. Moran and others have mentioned, the limited time period of 30 minutes was rolled out as a cost-saving ploy.  Perhaps it might work for medical prompts or something similar, but in general it is not enough time.  One hour was the standard amount of time spent with a client and some of us have followed that practice for nearly 50 years.  I fully agree with Senator Rose Conway-Walsh that it should remain.  It is very important that there be co-operation between the two Departments which as a non-political grouping we have tried to encourage.  The committee probably has far more strength than we do to push it forward and it is the biggest thing for which I ask.<\/p> <p>  A significant change in the home care sector is the running down of the home help budget.  There has been a drop of up to 25% in the home help budget as opposed to home care packages.  As Ms Jackson said, as a result, one no longer has one to three hours for early intervention care but is forced into the complex 15 or 20 hours arrangement.  That does not make any sense because we know that early intervention results in people staying at home for longer for 25% of those in receipt of care if one tracks them back to when the intervention happened.  We need to focus on early intervention and not push it aside in favour of more complex arrangements.  Things have got a little mixed up.  Complex cases should be kept at home with better trained staff and not have to be dealt with in a hospital.  If a person reaches a certain stage of deterioration or debilitation, he or she will have to go into hospital, but that process should be delayed, if not avoided.  That can be done.<\/p> <p>  Historically assessments were holistic and took into account which neighbours and family members could provide support.  One could then allocated the minimum number of hours because it would be complemented by the efforts of those around the client, but that has largely stopped and now a more formal structure is wanted.  I am all for that and it could be done using the common summary assessment report, CSAR, or another assessment tool.  In many places we had that holistic assessment.  If one's assessment indicated that one needed three or five hours of support, it was very hard to provide that amount of care.  We are inundated with requests to get people onto the ladder of care.  At the same time, however, we must prioritise complex cases, which is a contradiction.<\/p> <p>  I take on board what has been said by Professor O'Shea about clients paying for extra hours of care.  Historically, there was a means test and people who were able to pay, did so.  If there is no money available, clients topping up their number of care hours might be one of the only ways for them to receive sufficient care.  The majority of our members do not generally look for that business.<\/p> <p>  We need regulations and standards because of the inconsistencies nationwide.  I reiterate that all of our members would welcome a system under which tenders would be scrapped and there would be some form of accreditation.  There would be a list of accredited providers and people who had passed the test which would be available to anybody across the country who wanted it.  He or she could select an organisation knowing that it ticked the boxes in terms of compliance and standards.  It could be worked out without formal legislation.<\/p><p>The idea of a holistic, person-centred care approach has been done.  It is now being piloted as a new idea in community health organisation three, CHO3, in the mid-west.  In that approach the client has full say on how the hours are allocated.  That is happening.  That has been running since about September.  If there is a family carer in a household his or her request might be to have a break because if he or she burns out one is in serious trouble.  The home help or carer going in would release the person to go and take a walk, go down town, get out, get their hair done or whatever.  That is as important in the continuity of care as it is to go in and prompt medicines, etc.  I thank the committee very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fiacre Hensey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

Why work further then if they sacrifice any right to a social welfare payment?<\/p> <p>  That is why I am pushing the idea that it be worked out on the basis of working X number of hours for a working week.  Then carers, whether they work five hours in one day or five hours across five days, would still be entitled to the balance as a social welfare payment.  Most of those we would interact with do not want a social welfare payment.  However, they do want security of income and they do not have it.  I have had people coming up to me and saying, \"I cannot get a credit union loan because I do not know how much I will be earning next month.\"  There has to be a way that fuses the two together.

In this, I do not propose to deal with community-related issues as they are now the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  <\/p> <p>  To the end of June 2017, the Department had spent &euro;662 million from its allocation of &euro;1.779 billion as set out in the original 2017 Estimates, some &euro;20 million ahead of the published profile of expenditure for the Department of &euro;642 million.  When community spending programmes are excluded, the total at the end of June was &euro;625 million from the revised allocation of &euro;1.995 billion, capital and current.  This was some &euro;30 million ahead of the revised profile of expenditure.  I have circulated with my statement today tables that summarise the capital and current expenditure position at the end of June and as it now stands in November 2017.  The tables show that capital expenditure now amounts to some &euro;514 million, or 74% of the allocation, and current expenditure is now &euro;575 million or some 44% of the full-year allocation.  The position on spending on the Vote is being kept under close review in my Department as we move towards year end.  On the basis of the information now available, I expect we will be at full expenditure at year end.  In this process, we will reallocate funds as necessary to help ensure maximum benefits are achieved from the resources made available to us.  We will also continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as required in finalising the position on the Vote for 2017.<\/p> <p>  Turning briefly to some of the larger programmes, in 2017 the combined capital and current housing allocation is &euro;1.2 billion.  In addition, certain local authorities are funding a range of housing services from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to the value of over &euro;98 million, bringing the total housing provision to some &euro;1.3 billion.  To date in 2017, some &euro;498 million of Exchequer funding has been spent on housing capital programmes with a further &euro;77 million being spent by local authorities from surplus LPT receipts, the bulk of which has been used to support the construction and acquisition of social housing homes.  Reflecting the increased activity by local authorities and AHBs, 76% of the housing capital budget has already been spent.  Some &euro;402 million has been spent under the housing current expenditure programmes and this has been supplemented by spending totalling &euro;22 million by local authorities from surplus LPT receipts.  The high level of expenditure to date reflects the accelerated delivery of social housing across all programmes and we are well-positioned to achieve our 2017 target of 21,000 housing solutions for individuals and families.  In respect of HAP, I am pleased to say we have already exceeded our target under Rebuilding Ireland, with more than 15,130 tenancies established to date, which is an average of 344 HAP tenancies established every week in 2017.  In addition, almost 1,400 new homes have been delivered through the social housing current expenditure programme and we expect to reach the target of 2,250 homes before year end.  In the six months to the end of June, we delivered 800 new homes under the local authority build and acquisitions programme and a further 245 homes for older people, homeless people or people with a disability through the capital assistance scheme.<\/p> <p>  The level of social housing construction activity continues to grow as can be seen in the status reports published by my Department.  The most recent report to the end of the second quarter of 2017 shows there are projects which will deliver 11,000 new social homes, of which more than 1,000 homes have already been delivered in 2016 and the first half of 2017.  Over 2,700 new homes are on site being constructed.  The remainder are progressing through planning, design and tendering and we have not stopped.  Approvals for new social housing construction schemes are being issued to local authorities on an almost daily basis and I have no doubt this will be reflected when the third quarter status report is published in the coming weeks. <\/p> <p>  A key priority for my Department is addressing the issue of vacant homes.  Under the national voids programme, over 700 local authority homes have now been returned to productive use in 2017.  I expect we will be in a position to deliver almost 1,400 such homes this year, a near doubling of our target of 766.  In conjunction with the delivery of new social homes, my Department is focused on ensuring people are supported to stay within their own homes in line with their changing needs.  To date, we have provided almost 6,200 housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability and expect to meet or exceed the 2017 target of 9,000 grants. <\/p> <p>  Turning to LIHAF, while there will be an underspend this year due to projects being at design stage, with the larger construction costs expected to fall due from 2018 onwards, savings are being used to support increased activity under the local authority capital programme, including through the direct delivery of new social homes via construction and acquisition.<\/p><p>The funding for LIHAF projects is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to draw down over the lifetime of the projects out to 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p> Turning to my Department&rsquo;s water programme, as I mentioned at the select committee meeting this morning, following the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refunds to domestic customers, an additional provision of some &euro;293 million for payment to Irish Water has been made in the Revised Estimate.  This includes &euro;173 million needed to pay refunds to the 990,000 domestic customers.  There are also administrative costs associated with the refund process, estimated to amount to almost &euro;5.9 million.  In addition, &euro;114 million is being provided to cover the funding required by Irish Water arising from the extension of the suspension of domestic water charges to the end of 2017.  Funding will be made available to Irish Water to allow it to commence refund payments to customers following on from the passage of the Water Services Bill 2017.<\/p><p> The local government fund allocation in 2017 is &euro;365 million.  Total expenditure to date is &euro;100 million.  Significant payments from the fund take place in December and it is intended that there will be full expenditure of the allocation by the end of the year.<\/p><p> Turning now to the year ahead, the committee will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2018 will be &euro;2.457 billion in total.  Within that, housing is by far the biggest programme.  All told, &euro;1.9 billion will be available for housing next year, an increase of &euro;600 million, or 46%, on 2017.  This investment is directly aimed at addressing our housing shortage and homelessness crisis.  It represents an increase of 62% on the capital side, to build new homes and 35% on the current side, to over &euro;760 million, to allow further action on homelessness, as well as supporting people into new social housing tenancies through the HAP scheme.  In budget 2018, the total funding provision of &euro;1.9 billion for housing will allow us to deliver housing solutions for 25,500 households.  A large element of this, &euro;1.14 billion, is for the targeted delivery of new social homes through a range of construction, refurbishment and acquisition programmes.  Next year, 3,800 new social homes will be built directly by local authorities and approved housing bodies, which is 1,800 more homes than we will build in 2017.  A further 1,200 will be Part V builds or refurbished vacant homes, 900 homes will be delivered through acquisitions and a further 2,000 homes will be secured through long-term leasing arrangements, resulting in a total of 7,900 new social homes.<\/p><p> Looking beyond 2018, the budget provides an extra &euro;500 million for capital investment in social housing in the years 2019 to 2021, inclusive, which has allowed us to increase the Rebuilding Ireland social housing target from 47,000 to 50,000 homes.  As regards the funding of Irish Water in 2018, the Water Services Bill 2017 provides for a new funding model for domestic water services under which funding will be made through the Vote for the Department.  This will involve technical adjustments to the Vote and the consequential reform of the local government fund.  These changes will be made in the context of the Revised Estimates for 2018.  The channelling of all funding for domestic water services to Irish Water through the Vote will improve the transparency and accountability arrangements for this expenditure.  In overall terms, some &euro;1.1 billion will be required to meet the cost of domestic water services in 2018, of which &euro;500 million relates to capital investment.  This is the major financing component of the overall planned investment of over &euro;600 million in cash terms by Irish Water in 2018.<\/p><p> I hope that members have found this contribution helpful and I will be happy to deal with matters that members wish to raise, either on 2017 or 2018.  My officials will be in a position to come before the committee to give a more detailed update on the Rebuilding Ireland targets at a later date.  I would like to point out that next week or the week after I will be publishing targets for each local authority's social housing output programme for 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#A00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>Members are reminded that they have five minutes to ask questions of the Minister and he will be given five minutes to respond.

That said, there is an overspend on local authority housing of 11% and an underspend on voluntary and co-operative housing of 28%.  At the end of October, housing inclusion support was down by 60%.  The biggest disappointment is the fact that there has been no draw down on the &euro;50 million infrastructure fund to date.

This is because we are ramping up our programmes in terms of delivery for build, acquisition and everything else that we are hoping to do in respect of social housing.  Traditionally, capital spend drawdown can be lumpy in any year.  It would not necessarily be smooth over each month or each quarter but as we ramp up and as people become more familiar with the programmes and draw down their funding, we are actually finding a more even drawdown on the capital side.  We are on target to spend our money this year, according to the figures that we have up to October or November.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the subhead for housing inclusion and Traveller accommodation, we are working to increase the spends and the supports for local authorities to deliver and to support Traveller needs.  There will be an increased budget in 2018, from &euro;9 million to &euro;12 million, is important.  It is equally important that we make sure that funding is delivered effectively and efficiently to meet those needs.<\/p> <p>  The LIHAF from central government is ring-fenced in the capital programme but it will not necessarily have been drawn down by the end of the year.  Some of it will be drawn down this year but, obviously, the full &euro;50 million will not be drawn down.  However, that funding will be protected.  It is important to note that 28 of the 34 programmes that have been signed off are already at design stage, so work is already progressing.  The work is under way.  Whether the money is actually called upon within the next month or two does not really matter, so long as work is progressing and is not delayed by the fact that money has not been drawn down yet.

In that context, I particularly welcome the decision to designate Drogheda as a rent pressure zone.  Is there any other funding available to help people in particularly difficult circumstances?  I do not want to get into the specifics of any case but sometimes people are homeless because of issues in their past lives which could involve significant debt to another local authority, for example.  Some people with young families may have a debt that they cannot discharge which means that they cannot even get onto the housing list.

I will make a number of points, taking into account the context in which the question is framed and the <i>Daft.ie <\/i>report.  It is important to note that the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has its own rent index.  This is based on a much larger data set, with more aggregate.  It is based on actual registered tenancies and rents paid, not rents advertised.  The index is more accurate.  The data it contains relates to the quarters during which the rent pressures zones, RPZs, have already been in effect.  The <i>Daft.ie<\/i>research includes data from 2016 when the RPZs were not in existence.  We work to the data from the RTB.  While it shows an increase in rents, it also shows that the RPZs are having the intended effect in terms of keeping rent inflation below 4%.  Obviously, with every quarter, RPZs will take effect in new areas.  Most recently, zones came into effect in Drogheda and Wicklow.<\/p><p>I welcome the Deputy's comments on the role HAP plays, particularly as it does not always get the support it should.  It is a very significant measure that is being implemented by the State, using taxpayers' money to provide housing supports for people to access accommodation in the private rented sector.  We do not have enough social housing units to accommodate the needs of all relevant citizens at present.  Until we build more social housing units - and we have a programme for that - we will have to use other means.  HAP is one way in which we can actually find secure sustainable tenancies for people, with which they are very happy, into the long term.  This is evidenced by the number of HAP tenancies that have been achieved every week this year.  The figure will increase next year.  It is expected that approximately 47,000 tenancies will be supported in the course of 2018.  HAP plays a very significant role.  One of the important things we have done in the aftermath of the housing summit I hosted in September is that we have made arrangements to roll out the HAP place finder and the supports relating to it nationally.  As a result, where people experience difficulties in getting deposits or their first month's rent together, that support can help them to obtain tenancies.  The vast majority of people do not need help but there are some who do.  It is important that we have the support in place to help them.<\/p><p>One of the things the homeless inter-agency group I set up following the housing summit is doing is ensuring that the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities and the HSE are working together to ensure that the resources that are being invested - there is a great deal of money involved - benefit people who are in need of support and are being used in an effective way.  We have other programmes, such as the Abhaile service, that can help.  We have to be sensitive to people's individual needs.  This sometimes means that we have to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis.  Some cases are challenging because they involve complex needs.  There is no reason that a person should be sleeping in a car at all on any night of the year.

The headline above an article in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>morning states, &quot;Less than 1% of needed social housing has been built since start of 2016, says analyst&quot;.  In the article, Mr. Mel Reynolds, a housing policy analyst, provides statistics that I will not go into in detail.  That said, 6,005 people in Cork city are in need of social housing but only 59 houses were provided last year.  That is less than 1%.  Mr. Reynolds indicates that in the context of the demand for the social housing nationally, 120,598 people are in need of social housing and 1,093 units have been provided.  Again, that is less that 1%.  The purpose of what we are doing today is to look forward.  In that context, will there be an improvement and will it be a major improvement as opposed to something more minor in nature?<\/p><p>Statistics indicate that 1,509 new units will become available next year, if one excludes those that will be built by the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and voids.  At that rate, it would take 80 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  If we were to provide 2,000 homes on the basis of new builds - including those relating to the AHBs - for councils and excluding acquisitions, it would take 60 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  Even if we take the overall figure of 3,800, it would take more than 30 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  Will the Minister comment on the provision for social housing next year, which falls way short of what is needed in view of the crisis we are facing?<\/p><p>Mr. Reynolds is also quoted as saying that the figures are very poor and that &quot;You have to wonder is this policy&quot;.  In other words, he is veering in the direction of saying that not just the housing crisis but also, perhaps, that relating to homelessness are the result of Government policy.  This is in the context of a raft of comments in recent days.  The Taoiseach stated that the homelessness figures are low by international standards, which is not the case.  The Chairman of the Housing Agency states that the situation is normal and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, indicated yesterday that the comments of those who are raising points about homelessness are having a negative impact on the country's image.  These are attempts to minimise and to normalise the homelessness crisis.  The comments that have been made are cold and calculating.  I do not believe they are off the cuff; I am of the view that they are clearly part of a co-ordinated campaign and I ask the Minister of State, in light of what he said last night, to comment on that.  Does he deny that this is part of a co-ordinated campaign to minimise and normalise the homelessness crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#C01000","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister and the Minister of State to respond, if they choose to do so, but that is not what we are here to discuss.

A further 110 schemes, involving 1,106 homes, have practically been completed.  At various stages prior to completion, we have a few hundred schemes coming through with a few thousand homes, which gives us the overall figure of 11,000 under the current construction status figures.  When a newspaper article refers to less than 1% of houses built since the start of 2016, I really do not understand what figures they are relying on, what they are excluding or what they are including.  When we talk about meeting the needs of the tens of thousands on the social housing lists, let us look at the targets we have set in Rebuilding Ireland.  There is an allocation of &euro;6 billion until 2021 to meet all those needs.<\/p><p>Next year, we will build 3,800 social housing homes between local authorities and housing bodies.  That will be almost double what we will build this year, which is 2,000.  When we include voids and Part V units, it is another 1,200 units, which will bring us to 5,000.  We are going to acquire another 900 homes into the social housing stock, which brings us 5,900 and will long-term lease a further 2,000 units.  That is 7,900 secure social housing homes for people next year.  Obviously, there are other needs we need to meet and we use things like the housing assistance payment, HAP, to do that.  If we look over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland and consider what we want to build, to lease in the long term and to acquire, as well the voids we want to convert and the Part V units that will come in, we are talking about 50,000 homes thanks to the additional &euro;500 million that was acquired in the course of the capital review I undertook with the Minister of Finance earlier this year.  That is 50,000 secure sustainable social housing homes over the course of the period from 2016 to 2021, in addition to meeting the needs of others who have needs on the social housing list.  They will be met through the various supports including the HAP.  Next, we will be talking a bit about what the actual numbers are and whether it is 91,000 or a bit higher or a bit lower.  In the programme we have, however, we do not refer to timeframes of 80 years or 60 years.  We will do a significant amount of work between now and 2021 because of the priority the Government places on meeting the social housing needs of the citizens.  If considers the last two years of the Rebuilding Ireland programme and what we will be doing in respect of building, acquiring and leasing versus relying on the private rental market, we will be doing more on the build, acquisition and leasing side than on the HAP side.  As for claims that we rely too heavily on the private rental sector, we will bring the balance back to the responsibility of the State in respect of social housing delivery.  <\/p><p> When we look beyond 2021 - I am already doing this - to ascertain how we can make sure in future that we are protecting the needs of citizens by directly delivering social housing for local authorities and housing bodies and though other means, we aspire to a position in which 20% to 25% of all housing output in a given year is social housing provided directly by the State.  That is what we want to do and by doing that we will make sure that the people who are most vulnerable in our society in terms of their housing needs will always be protected, regardless of whether there is another housing crisis or another property bust in the future.  That is a very important goal that I wish to achieve in the Department.  Next week or in the week after, in another important point on which I touched in my opening statement, we will publish the targets for next year for all local authorities in order that there can be full transparency for Deputies and councillors as to what their own local authority is meant to achieve in respect of social housing output.  I will make that available to everyone in order that we can see what we need to achieve together.  <\/p><p> On the comments and question about the Taoiseach and Conor Skehan, the outgoing chair of the Housing Agency, we have a homelessness crisis.  One thing I have said since I first took up this role and was asked to do this job on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland is that it is very important to continue to talk about this issue, that is, to talk about the actual causes of homelessness and the very difficult circumstances people are experiencing.  While all members of this committee might be very familiar with it, some people are not that familiar with the problem and do not know the level of difficulty that some are experiencing.  We have had a tradition and a culture in this country of hiding difficulties in society and challenges we have faced.  That has been the way for far too long, that is, to turn an blind eye or to try to put something to one side.  It is very important that the homelessness crisis is front and centre in public debate and that people are aware that far too many people - families and individuals -  are experiencing extremely difficult circumstances with regard to both their housing needs and other problems such as mental health and addiction issues.  The Government must make sure as a priority that it is putting in every resource it can to help these people.  <\/p><p> In September, while people were going back to school, one very brave family went on the radio to tell their story of what that was like for the mother and her daughters.  It really touched a chord with people throughout the country.  They realised, if they had not done so previously, that in Irish society today, homelessness unfortunately is hitting and hurting people it had not previously.  That is why we are investing so much to try to support families who have found themselves in these very difficult circumstances.  That is why Deputies will have an opportunity later today to discuss this issue in the context of the Labour Party Bill before them.  That is why every week, both before and since the D&aacute;il returned after the summer, we have been discussing housing and homelessness issues and the difficulty people have in that situation.  To be frank about what the Taoiseach said at the weekend, he was asked a question about homelessness in Ireland being high by international standards.  He responded that it was low by international standards and in the same breath, he clarified that regardless of the international comparisons, we have a responsibility to people in the country who are experiencing these difficult circumstances.<\/p><p> It is important to know where we stand internationally because it is important that we can have an objective view of our policies and whether they are working.  All of the objective evidence tells us that by international comparisons, our rates of homelessness are low.  That points to policies that are working in this country, some that are working and some that are not.  When Conor Skehan talks about things being normal, he is talking about people understanding that homelessness is a crisis that many Western economies and societies face at present.  We are not exceptional in that case.  However, there is nothing normal for a family or an individual who are homeless today and there is nothing normal about how we work with the voluntary organisations and the local authorities to help those people.  We must, of course, help them with compassion and with care.  That is why when I talk about helping families who are in hotels and have been in hubs and when people ask me about timelines, I talk about being sensitive to their needs and delivering a tailored response to make sure that we have the greatest care because for a family or an individual to find themselves in homelessness -  we have all met people who unfortunately are in these circumstances - it is incredibly stressful and difficult and if their needs are not met with care, we could do damage inadvertently or they could find themselves suffering for a very long time into their adult lives and their future lives, which we do not want.  That is what we are trying to do here.  There is no attempt to minimise this as a problem.

That goes back to the commentary to which I was referring last night.  The commentary we hear on the homelessness and housing situation in Ireland often tries to give the impression that absolutely nothing is being done.  That is an unfair commentary on the Irish people, who are spending billions every year through the Government trying to help solve homelessness, to deal with homelessness from an emergency point of view and in the long term as well.  A lot of money is being spent on this with &euro;6 billion committed and more than &euro;2 billion will be spent in this area next year.  As for the constant commentary, the Deputy might have remained to hear some of the debates we have had in recent weeks in the D&aacute;il.  In every week since September, when speaking in D&aacute;il debates on housing, I have asked everybody to just deal with some of the facts.  I have no problem with people pushing for more and I understand that.  We put all the facts out there and do not try to hide any numbers but Members consistently come into the Chamber to contribute to debates and leave out the view that as a State, we are helping 21,000 people in a housing situation.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, and I keep saying we know it still is not enough to deal with the problem, that we are putting more money into the problem, are providing more solutions and keep trying.  However, the commentary that we are doing nothing cannot continue because that is damaging to us as a nation and to all those who are working in the front-line services night in and night out to provide help and accommodation and who are trying to work on long-term and short-term solutions.  That is what I discussed in my speech last night and I will defend that again because it is important that we recognise that.<\/p> <p>  In addition, as a nation we are trying to win investment from many different sectors in our society including job creation etc.  If all those outside looking in think the Government is sitting idly back and doing nothing to solve the housing problem, they might consider investing elsewhere and it is important that we on reflect what we are doing.  The Government consistently states that it never hides this, it knows that it is not enough to solve the problem and that it cannot stop until there is nobody in a homeless situation or on an emergency bed.  Please do not keep saying nothing has been done.  That is not a fair reflection and that is what I discussed in my contribution to the debate last night.  I ask the Deputy to take time out and listen to the full discussion because this goes back to my problem.  Even in the article published today by Mel Reynolds, he picks on one piece of the overall range of solutions and range of actions.  That is not good enough as a commentary and nor is it good enough for any Deputy to pick one area.  We are open to criticism on specific areas; that is not a problem and we take it quite well.  However, we are entitled to deal with the facts of the situation.  That is all I ever ask people to do in debates and that reflects the views expressed last night.  A lot of good work is being carried out here on behalf of the State and through voluntary bodies that needs to be recognised.  They are helping many people and we want to help more.  While that is what we all want to do, people should not ignore that work that has been done as well.  It is not fair to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#D01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has taken 14 minutes but I will allow you to come back in for 30 seconds to wrap up.

I have three questions but I want to make three observations first.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach said over the weekend that our levels of homelessness are low when compared to our peers.  That is a fact.  When he was pressed by the journalist at the press event, he referenced the 2017 OECD report.  The 2017 OECD report is a short and easy report to read.  It makes explicitly clear in its first page that there is no standard definition of homelessness between the listed OECD states.  It states that there is a wide variety of categories of homelessness.  Anyone who knows how we categorise homelessness, that is, by using the section 10 emergency-funded accommodation category, knows that we have one of the narrowest definitions in the OECD.  The OECD report states that we cannot compare from state to state.  Let us flip on two pages in the report to the table provided by the OECD.  It states clearly that the figures for Ireland are 2015 figures.  We all know that the figures have doubled since then.<\/p> <p>  This is not a row about statistics.  If we are going to find solutions to tackle the problem, we need to understand the depth and extent of the problem.  It is extremely unwise of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to try to use a report to make a claim publicly that the same report does not support - that is all I am saying.  The Taoiseach did it again twice yesterday.  He contradicted Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, because he said the report was a 2017 report, and he is right.  However, the figures are from 2015 and that is written in the report.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, should acknowledge that.  Prior to the Taoiseach's comments, when we have debated the matter on two or three occasions in the House the Minister has referenced that we have a lower level of homelessness when compared to our peers.  There is no evidence to support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E01800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>The point is made.

I have never said that we have a higher rate of homelessness than anywhere else.  In fact, I no one in the committee has ever said that.  However, we have an unacceptably high level.  In fact, there is evidence to suggest that it is higher than our immediate peers, as Eoin O'Sullivan has written about recently.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p><p>What is important above all in the mid-term review is the actual target.  Are the targets the Minister set out earlier in the year for the delivery of various categories of social housing being delivered?  In June this year, the Minister said in answer to a parliamentary question that the targets for this year were as follows: the construction units target was 2,284, the voids target was 766, the regeneration target was 150, the acquisitions target was 1,250, the leasing target was 600, the rental accommodation scheme target 100 and the housing assistance payment was 1,500.  We know the HAP targets have been exceeded.  They went over that figure in the last HAP report.  Where are we now with all of these categories?  The social housing construction target was 2,284.  How many units have actually been constructed?  It would be great to know how many have been tenanted, because that is what really matters.  I have no wish to know about what is in the pipeline or in future at the moment.<\/p><p>The point is likewise with the void figures.  The Minister has doubled the void targets.  The figure has gone from 766 to 1,400.  Where did these other void come from?  This is one of the things I am trying to get my head around.  Does this relate to an extra 700 voids that local authorities have not declared?  Are these long-term voids that have not been declared?  Are these voids that should have been provided for next year and that have been brought forward to this year?<\/p><p>I am also confused by other figures.  Page 34 of the mid-term Estimates book includes housing figures.  The figure for the social housing current expenditure programme is 2,250.  How does that compare with the figure of 600 for leasing, which is funded through the expenditure programme, in the targets announced earlier by the Minister?  Are some approved housing bodies funded through the expenditure programme that are accounted for separately to the leasing figure?  What I really want to know related to the new social houses to be delivered this year.  How many have actually been delivered to date that have people living in them?  That is a useful thing to know.<\/p><p>Reference was made to Traveller accommodation.  Page 34 of the book refers to 90 units.  Again, we are far behind in terms of the drawdown from local authorities.  That is a problem at the local authority rather than at the Department.  What is being done to ensure the maximum level of drawdown by local authorities to meet their commitments under the Traveller accommodation programmes for this year?  How hopeful is the Minister that we will have a better drawdown at the end of this year than for next year?<\/p><p>My next question relates to next year's expenditure.  Can the Minister confirm some details?  I presume the &euro;50 million from local infrastructure housing activation fund has been rolled over and added to the &euro;25 million extra funding announced in the budget.  That would make the figure for LIHAF &euro;75 million in total for next year.  Will the Minister confirm that?<\/p><p>I am also confused because there was no mention in the budget announcement of &euro;25 million for affordable schemes.  However, in the Minister's press conference and press release he referenced &euro;25 million, some &euro;15 million of which was for next year for some kind of affordable schemes.  Is that new money?  Is it re-profiling something within the existing budget?  When does the Minister expect to announce all of that?<\/p><p>The next question is on rents and the housing assistance payment.  Neither the <i>daft.ie<\/i>nor the Residential Tenancies Board data indexes are thorough.  For example, I am on the RTB rental index, but the relevant figures relate to the rent that I signed up to when it entered my tenancy 11 years ago.  There is no obligation on my landlord to notify the RTB of the rent increases I have experienced.  That means there is an underestimation in the RTB index, just as there is probably an overestimation in the <i>daft.ie<\/i>index because it refers to asking rents.  I do not believe that means we can dismiss be <i>daft.ie<\/i>rent index, although that is my interpretation of what the Minister has done.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that one of the significant changes in the housing assistance payment policy is that by the end of Rebuilding Ireland we expect approximately 100,000 households to be on a housing assistance payment that is meant to be relatively permanent.  Rent supplement was always seen as an emergency payment for a short period.  Therefore, there is something significantly different about HAP.  We will have the largest ever number of households, according to the Government plan, on a rent subsidy by 2020 or 2021.  However, the design of the policy is to be long-term.  That raises further questions.  Is the Government saying that the policy is now beyond 2020?  Is the idea to move people off HAP and into council housing?  Is it the case that, as the legislation states, their housing needs will still be deemed to be met and they will remain permanently or indefinitely subsidised in the private rental sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E02000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>I will come back to the initial comments.  I have no wish to labour the issue, but Deputy &Oacute; Broin is absolutely right in that I have talked about international comparisons before in discussing homelessness.  My responsibility as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is to ensure that we have an objective analysis of policy and that our policy is based on fact.  For far too long in this country, policies were not evidence-based.  We look to other jurisdictions to try to get a better understanding of what exactly they are experiencing and why.  We want to know what they have done that has worked and not worked and what we can implement ourselves.  Let us consider the number of children who are homeless in Scotland.  It is double the amount that we have in this country.  The number of rough sleepers in the United Kingdom is 20 times the number of rough sleepers in this country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right in a way.  We should not get lost in the weeds talking about international comparisons.  One family in emergency accommodation is one family too many.<\/p><p>Every time we see a rough sleeper on the street, our responsibility is to help him or her to find secure, sustainable accommodation.  That is why we work with initiatives such as Housing First.  The voluntary sector, with which we work and fund, tells us the best way to help the homeless is to get them into a home first and then give them wrap-around supports.  That is why developed the hub programme.  It is a first response but a much better response than a hotel.  We knew we needed to do something for the families to ensure they had the right supports in place.  We are now seeing a couple of things with the hubs.  First, families feel much safer and happier in the them than in the hotels, which is very welcome.  Also, families are moving very quickly from hubs into other forms of sustainable accommodation.  We collect more accurate data than other countries, which is good, and we publish them monthly.  That shows our commitment to making sure we are not trying to hide this, downplay it or minimise it.  We believe we should focus on homelessness because we believe, as the Taoiseach said, it is a stain on our society.<br\/><br\/>There is evidence of policies working.  I have stated the figures before.  The number of families in hotels has decreased by 20% since the peak in March of this year.  In August and September, we saw more families exiting emergency accommodation than entering.  That is the first time that has happened in three years.  There are about 2,500 people who would be homeless today if it were not for the great work done by the voluntary sector with local authorities in exiting people from homelessness and preventing people from falling into homelessness.  While the rate of family homelessness is increasing nationally, as per the September figures, the rate actually halved in the three preceding months by comparison with the three months preceding those three months.  It is important to recognise, not just for the taxpayer, who is concerned about how we are using our resources to help these people, but also for the volunteers and workers who are doing the work, that some of these policies are working.  They are not working as quickly as I would like them to, however.  For this reason, we had a housing summit to meet local authorities to determine what new initiatives we could introduce.  Helping with prevention will be the Housing First national co-ordinator, whom we hope to announce and appoint next week, the exit co-ordinators, who represent an important preventive measure, some of the change management practices we will introduce in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and other changes.<br\/><br\/>On LIHAF, the 2018 allocation is &euro;70 million.  The overall envelope for LIHAF is ring-fenced out to 2019 and 2020.  It is after that period that LIHAF 2, involving the additional &euro;50 million, will kick in.  It will not be until 2019 and 2020 so it is not a question of LIHAF 2 coming in next year.  I have a detailed database on each of the projects I have signed off on under LIHAF and the ones I am waiting to approve.  The vast majority are already at design phase.  We have an idea as to what might be called upon when we do a second call for LIHAF 2.  All of the money will be drawn down and used, and it will open up thousands upon thousands of new homes.<br\/><br\/>With regard to HAP, the RTB and their data, we always deal with a number of different data sets.  One thing we are having difficulty with in looking at completions is getting the most accurate data set.  I do not dismiss the <i>daft.ie<\/i>data.  It recognises a trend upwards.  We see that also.  One of the things I want to do with the RTB, which I announced in September, was to move to a point where we could have annual registration of tenancies.  That way we will get more thorough data for the RTB and even better data sets.  The data we do have from the RTB for the first two quarters of the year show the rent inflation in the rent pressure zones is below 4%, which is more than half the rate in 2016.  That is reliable information and it is welcome.<br\/><br\/>The additional &euro;25 million for the affordability schemes, which will work on top of what we are doing in LIHAF, is new money.  It will be allocated over 2018 and 2019.  In the course of the next two or three weeks, we will finalise how the criteria for accessing the scheme will work.  This will be done in conjunction with the housing bodies and local authorities.  I hope to make an announcement on that but it will not delay any work in terms of getting the houses built.<br\/><br\/>I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to answer the question with regard to Traveller accommodation.<br\/><br\/>When we consider our voids programme, we note voids can be an easy win because they are vacant local authority stock.  What we have been trying to do is ramp up a programme of void conversions as much as possible and move to a programme of maintenance to prevent homes from becoming voids and give a quicker turnaround time.  We have asked the local authorities to advise us on their numbers of outstanding voids and derelict units.  We are going to fund about 1,400 of those this year, which probably means that, in later years as we look at the programme, there may be fewer voids as a result.  It is cheaper to get a void back into use and we can do it more quickly, so we want to target as many of those as possible in a given year.  Hence, there is a ramp-up for this year.<br\/><br\/>SHEP covers all our leasing, including mortgage to rent.  That would explain the higher target in the table referenced.  With regard to our build targets, 5,050 units are on track to be delivered for this year.  That would include the build target we have, which is to have 2,000 built by local authorities and housing bodies this year.  If there is some slack in one area, we will make up for it in another.  I will be in a better position to talk about this in January.  Things are looking promising in terms of the social housing targets we have for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E02100","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>On the Traveller accommodation programme, the increased budget for last year was to try to provide 90 new units.

It has been a difficult area in which to achieve the spend.  It is a matter we have discussed in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere over recent years.  It is an area in which we want an improvement.  There is an increased budget for next year, an extra &euro;3 million.  That will put us in a position to provide more accommodation.  I am not happy about our expenditure in this area and all local authorities have a responsibility in this regard.  As members know, we had the review of the legislation and expenditure in this area.  We asked the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee to come forward with suggestions of names to work with us on an expert commission to determine how we can improve the situation and deal with the matter under the legislation to get the money spent.  I am concerned it is not targeting all the right areas.  Some local authorities are not pulling their weight.

I am looking forward to the committee working with us on that and in trying to make changes.

On the commentary on nothing being done, quoted by the Minister of State, Deputy English, I do not believe is the case.  It is the case that what is being done does not appear to be working, unfortunately.  That is the commentary.  The crisis is escalating and the figures bear that out.  It was poor judgment on the part of the Taoiseach to say what he said.  It is not just me saying that.  When one heard Fr. Peter McVerry on the radio earlier saying he was furious, one could imagine the views of those he helps and whom we want to help.<\/p> <p>  My question is similar to that of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I will try to make it as simple as I can in the hope the respective personnel and Minister will make the response as simple as they can.  With regard to capital expenditure of local authorities, by the beginning of November &euro;243 million was spent.  Was it purely on construction, or was the figure inclusive of purchases?  If both, could we have a breakdown?  How many houses were delivered?  Could I be told that if one figure is divided by the other, the cost of a house is &euro;150,000, for example?  How many houses are being delivered by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector based on the expenditure of &euro;75 million?<\/p> <p>  A figure of &euro;90 million was mentioned for other services.  That is quite a large figure to throw in under that heading.  I would like a breakdown of the other services.  I do not see the repair-and-lease scheme, for example.  Unfortunately, we know it has been a great failure.<\/p> <p>  Could I be told when the former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, announced LIHAF?  We need to learn from our past, even our recent past.<\/p><p>It has been 18 months to two years since that was initially announced, and not a penny has been drawn down on it.  I asked about that some months ago, and of course there were contracts being prepared and signed and so on.  Why is that the case?   What is the problem with it, that it has not borne fruit much more quickly, as was expected, so that we might make improvements as was done on the repair and lease scheme?  To bring it down to brass tacks, if the Minister can tell me that &euro;243 million was spent on the provision of social housing and a certain number of houses were delivered, that tells me how much it is costing.  &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance in Ballymun is acquiring State lands at &euro;1,000 per site and providing housing units for between &euro;140,000 and &euro;200,000.  That is affordable housing.  That is social housing.  That is delivery, and it should be replicated throughout the country, because if those figures are accurate, then that is the solution to our problem.  As an example of our problem, one hears of a site in County Meath that was bought some years ago at the height of the boom.  We are only getting half the potential units from it, because we are trying to recoup the costs of purchasing it some years ago.  There is nothing affordable or social about that policy.  I would like a breakdown of what we have delivered, and how much it costs to deliver each individual unit.  I thank the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#F00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As a brief reply to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, we can absolutely learn lessons from other countries.  That is why I think international comparisons are important.  Let us leave that part of the debate there.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cowen, the local infrastructure housing activiation fund, LIHAF, is an excellent initiative whereby we can use a relatively small amount of taxpayers' money to unlock very big housing sites, from which we will derive a Part 5 commitment from a developer and a cost reduction per-unit or its own little affordability scheme.  <\/p> <p>  However, some of the sites have a number of different owners.  They might be part locally-owned.  There might be different requirements in the local area.  Actually putting together contracts with the private side and with the local authority is not necessarily straightforward, but a huge amount of work has been done.  While money has not been drawn down yet, we are at design stage for many of these projects.  They know exactly what they are going to do.  Some money has been drawn down, albeit a small amount, and LIHAF is going to deliver thousands of new homes.  I have a detailed table of exactly what has been signed off and at what amounts, and if the Deputy wants to examine a couple of sites we can do that.  I can discuss how the money is being leveraged and what it might return. <\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the repair and leasing scheme before in regard to its effectiveness to date.  The scheme has received a total of 705 applications as of 9 November.  That is an increase of 32% on on the figure for the second quarter of this year.  Some 18 agreements to lease have been signed.  That is obviously a much smaller number than what we had hoped to achieve with the repair and leasing scheme this year.  As we have already spoken about, we recognised midway through the year that there were problems with the scheme that were making it unattractive for people to access, such as the length of time for which the lease agreement would have to be entered into.  We are finalising a new version of the repair and lease scheme which will be notified to all local authorities very shortly.  It will address those issues of concern that have made the scheme less attractive than it might have been.   The Department manages its budget in the total envelope.  As such, money that was not utilised under the repair and lease scheme was moved to other areas, such as homelessness services, where there were additional demands, for more hubs for example.  That is where the funding has gone.  However, where private vacancies are concerned, the repair and lease scheme will be an important tool to get more vacant homes back onto the market and in use for social housing.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to other services,  a sum of &euro;90 million includes &euro;70 million for some of the Housing Agency's acquisitions and &euro;20 million for the pyrite remediation scheme.  It funds some areas of housing research and also contributes to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  In regard to the 5,050 units to be delivered this year I would like to comment on the &Oacute; Cualann model.  It is a fantastic model, which is why I have met with them in my Department and we are trying to do something at a greater scale.  That is what I hope the &euro;25 milllion will go towards,  a model whereby the local authority can use local authority land sold at &euro;1000 or &euro;2000 euro per house, build a home and sell it via mortgage to a tenant much more cheaply than what might have been available.  For example, when I visited the &Oacute; Cualann scheme, I met a woman who had been paying something like &euro;1500 in rent and was now paying a mortgage of &euro;700.  That made an incredible difference to her life and her family life.  That is what we want to do and what we want to achieve with our affordability schemes.  <\/p> <p>  Over 1,000 local authority and housing body builds are complete at present, according to Q3 data, which will be released in the coming weeks.  There are more coming, obviously, because of the target numbers of direct builds, which we will hit before the end of the year.  For acquisitions, the target of 12,50 has been met; for leasing the target was 600, which has been met.  In regard to the Rental Accomodation Scheme, RAS, half the targets on Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, have been exceeded, and the RAS target is on track. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>Am I to take it, then, that 1,000 units have come from a spend of &euro;243 million?

A failed system will not work, no matter how much money is put into it.  I understand that the Minister is working and trying to sort out issues, but let us examine the RAS.  If someone is on the housing list and is in receipt of RAS, they are taken off the housing list.  If I have ten people in my clinic who are on the RAS, and I go to the local authority housing list to look for their names, they are not on it.  This happens to thousands upon thousands of people.  It is an absolute nightmare.  It is not working.  I have to say, in fairness to the Minister, he has been working with the HAP, but I have a major concern with it.  If someone gets onto the local authority housing list, they are automatically entitled to the HAP.<\/p><p>Many landlords will not take tenants on HAP which is causing serious concern for us because we are trying to see if landlords will take tenants on HAP - certain landlords do.  A person who had a mortgage whose house has been repossessed, who is no longer living there and is trying to find accommodation but whose name is still on the deeds cannot go on the housing list.  Years ago people could be on two local authority lists; they could get only one house but it gave them the flexibility.  A person living in Wicklow cannot be placed on the housing list in Carlow.  This is why people are becoming homeless.  We are coming across another type of homelessness that is not being addressed.<\/p><p> Carlow has one of the lowest income ceilings.  A person needs to be earning less than &euro;27,500 to go on the local authority housing list in Carlow.  The figure in the neighbouring counties of Laois and Wicklow is &euro;30,000.  That is the issue.  These are issues causing homelessness.  People who do not qualify should be given encouragement to get a mortgage because so many people do not qualify to get a mortgage through the banks and building societies, nor do they qualify to be on the local authority housing list.  This is the new homelessness.  These people are in no-man's land.<\/p><p> I was very disappointed about the rent-pressure zone areas.  Rent-pressure zone areas are crucial but because we have an emergency situation, every local authority should have qualified just until we got out of the housing crisis.  I understand it is not possible to leave them there all the time.  It is very hard for me to see my neighbouring county qualify for the rent-pressure zone area while we have the same issues but do not qualify.  That is where all the confusion is.<\/p><p> I welcome the initiative on the vacant houses, but the issue is with the timescale for getting them back to the local authority when they are ready to go.  We seem to be getting the same figures all the time.  I ask the Minister to put something in place.  There is no accountability in a local authority.  The Minister needs to move on these.  I welcome what is happening with these vacant houses, but they are coming back too slowly; there is too much red tape and it is not working out.<\/p><p> I have massive concerns about the 800 local authority new builds.  We need to build.  I know the Government has exceeded its targets on the HAP scheme.  Taxpayers' money is going to 15,120 new tenants to cover rent for accommodation that those people will never own.  These are the issues we need to consider.<\/p><p> I welcome the money the Minister has allocated for the housing adaptation grant.  Carlow got an additional &euro;500,000, which is marvellous.  People are living longer and that is the area that needs to be addressed most urgently.  Most people attending my clinic are looking for all this extra help because they actually cannot afford it.  It is great that the Minister is putting money into that.<\/p><p> I have picked the points where I feel the system is not working.  Local authorities need to be given more leniency and we need more accountability.  It is creating a new homelessness crisis.  The people I have highlighted are being forgotten.  I know the Minister will address it.  I ask the Department to consider these issues.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue of mortgages for people who are in no-man's land of being in work but not qualifying to go on the local authority housing list.  He should give them the chance and build houses.  I was not too hard on the Minister today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#G01800","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510741800,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>The Senator is absolutely right about the money allocated for adaptation grants.

If the private sector did not exist, this problem would be much worse.  There is something of a Hobson's choice in having to do that.  Being able to give flexibility to people to choose where they want to live but with State support and to be able to rent and not have to commit themselves to a 20, 30 or 40-year commitment works for some people but for many people it does not.  That is why we are focusing so much on building acquisitions and long-term leases to get people into secure sustainable tenancies.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about vacancy and accountability.  We need more transparency here.  Through transparency we get accountability.  That is why either next week or the week after I will publish targets and write to every local authority about what they will build next year so that the Senator, as a representative of her community, together with the councillors and everyone else can actually see what is meant to be delivered and can ask questions of the local authority as to what is happening week-in and week-out.  It is only by doing that, together with everything being transparent, that we can drive the kinds of results we will need to see next year.  I am quite confident that we will almost double our social housing build next year.<\/p> <p>  There was considerable debate about rent-pressure zones at the time and in the preceding years.  Someone previously said they were going to bring in rent caps or freeze rents.  It actually had an adverse effect on the market in that landlords moved to ratchet up rents before the freeze came in.  In other countries that brought in blanket measures on rent, it froze the market and resulted in some people paying very little rent when they could afford to pay much more while others were locked out of the rental market.  The two qualifying criteria for rent-pressure zones of looking back at four of the previous six quarters and the average rent across the country are sound.  As we come through each quarter, new areas fall into the rent-pressure zones.  Obviously there will be a spillover effect in where there is a rent-pressure zone and an area just outside it.  That is one of those unintended consequences of a policy that is introduced.  However, the RPZs are working and we will continue with that policy into next year.<\/p> <p>  Much of the Senator's contribution related to the affordability issue and she is right to highlight it.  We need to be careful not to make too quick a comparison to a new type of homelessness.  I recognise the difficulties people have in trying to pay high rents and save for a deposit.  I know people who have had to move back to their parents' homes either because they cannot afford the rent or in order to allow them to save for the deposit.  What they are experiencing is difficult for them and their lives.  It is a far cry from what people who are forced out of accommodation are experiencing.  We are being sensitive in how we talk about it.<\/p> <p>  For a long time people who qualified for social housing support got all this support from the State, but those who did not qualify felt almost abandoned.  We cannot be that black and white with our policies anymore; life is complicated.  Sometimes giving an individual a little bit of support can make a very big difference.  Under LIHAF 1 and LIHAF 2, on 70% of the sites two and three-bedroom houses will come in below a certain threshold.  However, on about 30% of the sites we will have affordable schemes whereby someone who does not qualify for social housing but who would not be able to afford a house on the market will be able to enter those homes on an affordable-to-buy or affordable-rent scenario.  That is what I will be announcing in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the additional &euro;25 million we announced in the budget is also for affordability schemes.  We look to something like the &Oacute; Cualann model in terms of co-operative housing and what the qualifying criteria were for people to be placed in those homes through the local authority.  We will consider something similar for those affordability schemes.  I return to a point Deputy Cowen made.  While Dublin City Council charged &Oacute; Cualann only &euro;1,000 a unit, the cost the council incurred was about &euro;70,000 per unit when servicing costs and everything else are taken into account.  There are not necessarily clean ways of calculating these things and we try to average them out.<\/p> <p>  We are reviewing the qualifying criteria in terms of thresholds for social housing supports.  We are also reviewing the incremental tenant purchase scheme.  Someone on HAP can transfer to another area, but only if transferring up.  Senator Murnane O'Connor mentioned that landlords did not like HAP.  We have experience of 23,000 or 24,000 landlords, some of them with multiple properties, working with the different agencies to help people into HAP tenancies.  HAP has been successful.  We have exceeded our HAP target this year.  While I understand why there might be difficult cases with individual landlords, the overall experience is that it works and that people are happy to engage in a HAP tenancy.<\/p><p>It is superior to previous programmes because there is the flexibility to go above the amounts and add 20%.  It is important that we have that option.  If we can learn from what we do and constantly review and analyse what is and is not working - I hope that is the approach I am taking to this brief - together with full transparency and accountability, with everything being published and everyone aware of our targets and what we are doing, we can improve the system and make it work for the people who are at the receiving end of it.  We have to make sure they are getting the support they should be getting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#H00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>I agree that there are very good landlords, but there are also landlords who do not want to accept the housing assistance payment.

Twenty years ago a family would have been given a home within three years.  Now children are eight or nine years old before they have an opportunity to live in their own home.  This is a huge hidden problem.  There is enormous pressure on those families who have to live in their parents' homes.

The other was the front room in which all of the children were living with their mother.  It did not make sense.<\/p> <p>  I want to praise the local authorities in County Louth.  I asked a question last week and will ask for the answer in a different way.  I may not get it today.  Despite the criticism, there is very good practice.  I am the first to criticise the county councils in Dublin which were offered 2,000 houses by NAMA, of which they took less than 1,000.  I have criticised Fingal County Council which was offered 270 houses by NAMA but took only 105.  It dismisses our figures for the numbers of unoccupied homes.  Louth County Council, however, is exceptional.  It has sourced social housing in abandoned or vacant properties.  I understand 50 units have been completed in this way this year.  If every council in the country were to do the same, it would make a huge difference.<\/p> <p>  With the support of Mayo County Council, the Minister rightly set up a vacant or empty homes website.  I read in the newspaper this morning that by September this year 10,000 queries had been made to the website.  Will the Minister comment on the efforts made by Louth County Council and do what he can to ensure other councils will do what it is doing so effectively?  It is one thing to turn the sod to build houses, but these are houses which are already available.  They have doors into which we can fit keys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy like to ask any question about water services which come under programme B?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I want to ask about why I was sacked from my job as Minister of State.

Last year &euro;140 million was earmarked for the completion of phase one and the start of phase two of the metering programme.  I understand it has been re-profiled in the overall capital spend, but Irish Water has not been able to give us an indication as to when that money will be spent.  Will it be spread out over the period 2018 to 2021 and will it be spent on something more specific?  Does the Minister have any information in that regard?  I am asking because there is a particular difficulty with wastewater treatment, not just in the 38 agglomerations covered by the European Commission's legal action in the European Court of Justice.  Why has the overall capital spend under the programme not changed on the back of the European Commission initiating legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice?  Has there been a movement of money to try to bring forward the investment to bring the 38 agglomerations up to speed to either reduce or minimise the impact of the legal action?  I am concerned because this applies to more than just the 38 agglomerations.  In its latest report the Environmental Protection Agency has detailed up to 100 locations around the country, in almost every county, where raw sewage is being pumped.  I know that there has been a change since last year in terms of the Minister's responsibility for this issue.  Much more responsibility has devolved to Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation, but given the fact that we are facing a legal action against the State rather than Irish Water, I presume that the Minister and his officials have a particular interest in ensuring the maximum level of investment to tackle the 38 sewage plants most at risk of causing pollution.  How is he dealing with that issue in the Estimates for next year and following years?<\/p> <p>  At the Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services one of the issues that arose was that the European Commission was very concerned that funding from central government for Irish Water could not be guaranteed in the longer term.  While the Minister and the Government have made verbal commitments, they are still subject to the budgetary cycle each year.  The Minister has made a commitment and I accept his bone fides in terms of the plan to meet both the need for direct investment and borrowing commitments year on year as per the business plan, but it is subject to agreement each year.  Some of us proposed that a way to get around this was for the State to enter into a legally binding ten-year service level agreement with Irish Water to ensure funding certainty which might allay some of the fears of the Commission.  That idea was not supported at the committee by Fine Gael, but I presume it is still an issue in the Minister's engagement with the Commission.  Is it something at which the Government is looking or considering to overcome that problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>On Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's points-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>Does the Minister miss the Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>He does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>-----we use Louth County Council as an exemplar when we look at what we are trying to do in housing provision in other parts of the country.  It had an important role to play at the housing summit in September, at which it discussed the things it had done successfully such as the issuing of compulsory purchase orders.  <i>Vacanthomes.ie<\/i>is a website which is managed by Mayo County Council and it has been very successful in that people have been able to publicly identify a vacancy.<\/p><p>That allows us to determine whether properties are actually vacant.<\/p><p> In July we requested every local authority to appoint empty home units.

We gave local authorities in cities and large urban areas a target of reverting to us with more detailed data for their vacancy numbers by the end of October and every other local authority a target of providing the data by the end of the year.  On the back of that data we will be able to target vacant homes to try to bring them back into use.<\/p><p> There has been a debate on the actual number of vacant homes.  Different data sets and figures have been produced.  Various local authorities have begun to drill down into and examine them.  For example, when we inspected units Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had been told were vacant, they turned out to be businesses.  One needs to get on site.

An additional incentive was included in the budget by the Minister for Finance where work was needed to bring vacant homes back into use in the private market rather than as social housing.  The incentive provides for allowable expenses of &euro;5,000, the bridging part, to take advantage of the home improvement scheme.

I take his point about service level agreements being a way of achieving certainty on funding for Irish Water.  I have engaged with the commissioner on this matter.  The Water Services Bill will allow us to provide for the preparation of multi-annual strategic funding plans for Irish Water as part of a framework to ensure we will invest what we need to invest.  With Irish Water, we will be guided by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  It will be up to the Oireachtas on an annual basis to approve the allocation of funding.  That is an important role played by the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance and I are working to ensure our plans for the funding of Irish Water will be aligned with and reflected in his ten-year national investment plan.  This year the Cabinet noted the funding that would be required by Irish Water up to 2021.  It is my responsibility, in working with the Oireachtas, to deliver it.  It will be clear to everyone what is required from Irish Water on an annual basis in terms of the capital and current spend.  My obligation will be to deliver it each year and it will be for the Oireachtas to vote it through.<\/p> <p>  On wastewater treatment and action by the European Union, now that the questions about the future funding of Irish Water have been clarified and resolved in the Water Services Bill, we can embark on a programme of work to ensure we can upgrade and make the necessary investments.  We will do this while taking account of the EPA's reports and the requirements under the directive.  Separate from Irish Water, other subheads in the budget show an increase in funding for work related to water quality since last year.  Irish Water also has investments to make.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 Irish Water identified the potential for savings from the domestic metering programme to be used to fund work on priority non-domestic meter upgrades which would underpin the non-domestic revenue stream and the urgent provision of strategic water and wastewater infrastructure to enable priority development lands to be opened up.  The money will move into that area in so far as Irish Water's investments are concerned.<\/p> <p>  The changes to the funding model on the back of the Water Services Bill, the debate on which I hope will conclude in the Seanad this week, will not affect our capital investment in 2018.  It has been secured and will be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>I have three questions, the first of which is about rural and group schemes.

Many groups have approached me recently because they have been told that they do not qualify for the grant.  It is down to the amount of money they must find for a rural water scheme.  In the light of the current position, that is unfair.  People form a group and say they can come up with a certain amount of money, but they do not meet the criteria because they are told that the funding is not available.  Will there be a scheme to help those who need to qualify?  The current system is not working.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter.<\/p> <p>  Regarding water meters, I wish to ask about the first fix policy.  Under current legislation, everyone is entitled to a first fix, but something needs to be clarified.  What will be the cost of a second or third call-out?  What exactly does it mean?  What if someone has to keep ringing Irish Water about the same leaking pipe?  Irish Water will fix it but three weeks later the same pipe will start to cause hassle again.  Is it entitled to charge the person?  If someone keeps complaining about the same problem, it is like a first fix.  Will there be a standard charge - people are concerned about this issue - and what will it be after the first fix?<\/p> <p>  Having dealt with Irish Water a great deal recently, I must say it is good to deal with.  It reverts to me straightaway, emails me and follows up constantly.  It is important to recognise this.  My dealings with Irish Water have been good.  However, my question is important, as we do not want someone to get a bill for &euro;100 or &euro;150 after a first fix.  People do not have that money.  We all know how precious water is and that we must use it wisely and go by the guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K01900","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Pat Casey have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K02000","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>I have two quick ones, the first of which is about problems with water quality.<\/p><p>There seems to be significant underspend in capital investment and perhaps the Minister will explain this to me, in light of the number of areas where we are breaching EU regulation.

I am aware of how the excellent work they have done over many years in communities up and down the country was, perhaps, lost in the whole debate we have had on Irish Water and water generally in recent years.  When water charges for domestic customers of Irish Water were suspended, the group water schemes went back to their pre-2015 subsidy levels.  Engagement has already begun on a semi-formal basis with the federation as to how we make up for the difference during the period of time when we suspended the provision of the money.  We will formalise our engagement once the Bill comes out of the House so we can ensure we make up any money that was lost as a result of the suspension of the scheme but also that we look at the equity of treatment, to which the Deputy referred, which is also in the joint committee's report.  That work will begin next week or the week after, once the Bill comes out of the Seanad.  We spend approximately &euro;20 million on the subsidies, but another &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million, or a little higher, will be the cost of bringing the subsidies up to previous levels given the changes being made as a result of the Water Services Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Vote next year will cover Irish Water's obligations under the service level agreements, SLAs, with the local authorities.  Next year will look a lot different because of the changes we will make on motor tax, the local property tax and the local government fund.  There will be a much clearer funding stream into Irish Water so it will be easier to navigate in so far as the accounts are concerned.  As per the commitment I gave on Committee and Report Stages of the Water Services Bill, we are trying to expedite consideration with the Minister for Finance on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us greater oversight of the audited accounts of Irish Water.  There is obviously a role here for the Commission of Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in terms of regulating and overseeing the costs incurred, even with the SLAs entered into with local authorities.  If a new agreement is reached, in so far as 2021 is concerned, the saving anticipated at present is approximately &euro;1 billion.  It is not intended to impact service delivery.  It is intended to improve service delivery from the economies that can be achieved by doing this at an earlier timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#L00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>Is that &euro;1 billion over a period of years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#L00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>It is the 2014 to 2021 business plan period.

The franchise section effectively becomes an electoral commission once a referendum, a presidential or, indeed, a general election is called.  The funding that was allocated in the figures for last year principally concerns the fact that there was a court challenge to the outcome of the children's referendum in 2012.  The bill of costs was budgeted for in anticipation that it would be presented but that has not happened yet.

I am accompanied by Ministers of State Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan and Department officials Mr. John McCarthy, Ms Mary Hurley, Ms Maria Graham, Ms Lorraine O'Donohue, Mr. David Walsh, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 Revised Estimate for my Department was published last December and was considered in select committee last March.  That Estimate is now being revised to do two things: first, to take account of the transfer of community functions from my Department to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development, under the leadership of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring; and second, to reflect the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refund of water charge payments made by domestic customers.<\/p> <p>  I will take the community transfer element first.  On 14 June 2017, the Taoiseach announced his intention to establish a new Department to undertake responsibilities in relation to rural and community development matter, to be led by Deputy Michael Ring.  This has resulted in the transfer of community-related functions from my Department and of associated spending subheads from its Vote.  The two community business units which have transferred to the new Department cover: community and voluntary supports and programmes, and social inclusion and communities.<\/p> <p>  These business units have a budget of &euro;77.5 million for 2017, including administration costs.  The transfer comprises a total of &euro;67 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.5 million in capital expenditure, together with appropriations-in-aid amounting to &euro;6.3 million.  I have circulated with my statement a table that summarises the financial transfers, which in accordance with established practice cover all spending in the areas concerned in the full year 2017.<\/p><p>In addition, the relevant staff implementing these programmes have moved to work in the new Department.<\/p><p> Moving on to the funding for Irish Water, the new Estimate for 2017 also reflects the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refunds to domestic customers.  The Water Services Bill 2017, currently in the Seanad, provides for the repeal of the 2014 domestic water charging regime and introduces a new programme focused on the promotion of water conservation, under which a levy will apply in certain circumstances for usage of water above a reasonable threshold.  In making these changes, provision is made in the Bill for the extinguishing of liabilities under the current regime and the making of refunds to the 990,000 customers who paid in accordance with the 2014 Act.  This will give rise to a new funding model for Irish Water which is underpinned by the Bill.  The Bill thus reflects the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which were adopted by both Houses last April.  Accordingly, a provision of some &euro;293 million for payment to Irish Water has been made in the Revised Estimate, in programme B - water services.  This figure includes the &euro;173 million needed to pay refunds to the 990,000 domestic customers.  There are also administrative costs associated with the refund process, estimated to amount to almost &euro;5.9 million.  A further &euro;114 million is being provided to cover the additional funding required by Irish Water arising from the extension of the suspension of domestic water charges to the end of 2017.<\/p><p> In conclusion, following the transfer of community functions and the making of the new provisions for Irish Water, the gross budget for my Department in 2017 now stands at &euro;1.995 billion.  Taking into account the changes in those two programme areas, this represents an increase of &euro;215 million on the Revised Estimate published last December.  I am of course happy to discuss the details with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#A00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I know it is too late to change this but some of us have a concern that the transfer of the final bits of community out of his Department, particularly those that relate to community development functions within urban local authority areas, could have a detrimental impact on the delivery of those services.  I am aware that ultimately, that is not a decision for the Minister or his Department.  I wish to put on record, however, that a lot of us would have preferred to see those functions remain in the Department that deals with local government, particularly because they are now also tied up with the local community development committees and the social inclusion committee activation programme.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates basically have three elements: The transfer of the funds for those final remaining bits of community from the Minister's Department to the other Department; the additional funding for refunds; and the funding for Irish Water for this year.

I know that is what he has just said, but I would like it to be very clear.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the additional money for the refunds and for the funding of Irish Water, can the Minister confirm the source of that funding?

We both deal with local authorities.  Local government comes under my Department but given the role that the Minister, Deputy Ring, has in the new Department, local authorities will be key to that.  We have a very close working relationship.  In any transfer of functions there is always some difficulty; whenever a new Department is being set up it takes a bit of time.  Staff have to relocate.  All of that sometimes creates delays or difficulties but we are doing our best to make sure that we work together and that there will be minimal disruption to any funds or activities that are transferring from my Department out that of the Minister, Deputy Ring.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's questions about what we are doing with the Revised Estimate, yes, it is about transferring the funding, staff and responsibilities for community into the new Department.  It is also providing those amounts for the payments of refunds to be made, the administrative costs for those payments and the additional money that must be expended because of the continued suspension of water charges for this year, which was not previously allocated.  As for where the money is coming from to do that, it is additional Exchequer funding that is available.  In other words, it is taxpayer funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#B00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comment on the transfer of the community function.  Although we will not have responsibility for the new Department there may be a role for this committee to invite in the Minister, Deputy Ring, maybe once a year or so, to discuss the management of those elements.  The only reason I am saying this is since the restructuring of the old community development programmes from Pobal by the former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, they are much more integrated into the local authority structure and policy.<\/p> <p>  We had a very interesting discussion here yesterday about rates.  Part of the difficulty with rates is that they are split between two Departments, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Justice and Equality.  When we are trying to discuss policy and potential reform that creates some difficulty.  I am concerned that the case might be similar here.  That might be something we could address.<\/p> <p>  While I am aware the sources of the funding referred to derive from revenue, what we would like to know is what part of the revenue pot they come from.  Clearly, there were areas of underspend in the Estimates that were allocated for the Departments this year.  It would be good to identify those elements of underspend that allowed the Government to transfer this money across to deal with the water situation.

The staff are now to be transferred in the year 2021.  The original plan was that they would be transferred over at a later date, I think it was 2026 although I stand to be corrected on that.  It is happening five years before it was originally planned.  I am concerned that this has implications for those workers in terms of their pay and pensions.  The official line is to say it will not make any difference.  However, the experience of workers who have been transferred from State to semi-State bodies in the past has been that there were implications for pay and pensions.  Any telecom worker will give the Minister the lowdown in that regard.  Will the Minister indicate who made the decision to speed up the transfer?  When was that decision made?

I have plenty of experience in my own constituency of pensioners having received phone calls from Irish Water putting them under pressure to pay, even if it was only a fiver, so as to avoid penalties.

Obviously, service level agreements were put in place.  These originally went to 2025, not 2026.  Irish Water has come together as a single utility for the country and is working with the local authorities.  It has been bringing in staff from local authorities and maintaining agreements with individual local authorities.  It has taken on assets and is improving them and improving our water infrastructure.  Irish Water has seen the possibility of expediting that.  The potential savings that would accrue to the body and to the State as a result would be potentially &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  When Irish Water consulted me on whether it should pursue this, I agreed that it should but I was very clear in my conversations with it that this would only work if it could be done in agreement with the staff in terms of making sure that people were happy that there would be no diminution of their salary or pension benefits.  No decision has been made but this is something we are progressing to see if we can do it.  We have a piece of work ongoing in NewERA to make sure that benefits such as pensions would be safe because that is essential if this is to be successful.  That piece of work is happening at present under the Water Services Act.  We have not come to a conclusion on it, but we are doing this with the utmost care and consultation with the relevant people involved to make sure that they understand exactly what is being proposed and that we can all be certain that there will be no negative effect on pay, conditions and pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#C00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Water Services Bill is being debated in the Seanad and I hope it will be completed this week.  As we now have an understanding of the role of Irish Water in the coming years, I hope that as the Oireachtas, we try to support that work and help Irish Water do its important work for citizens, whether they marched or did not march or paid or did not pay their water charges.  Irish Water has a job of work to do and it needs our support.<\/p> <p>  Having worked with Irish Water for the past six months, having visited the premises and met the staff - I met the staff on site in Drogheda and in other parts of the country - the staff of Irish Water need our support.  The brand \"Irish Water\" has been damaged since its inception and we have to help the staff of Irish Water to do their job effectively for the benefit of everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#C01000","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>I must respond briefly to the comments of Deputy O'Dowd and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.

I will make a short address, following which I am happy to take any questions.  I will first outline my career and then my approach and vision as chairperson.<\/p> <p>  I am a seasoned professional with senior management experience gained across industry sectors, particularly infrastructure, waste to energy, regional economic development, investment banking, aviation and transportation, gained over the past 30 years.  I began my career in 1987 working with KPMG for eight years.  I am a chartered accountant and a chartered director.  I hold a bachelor's degree in commerce and an MBA degree.  Most recently, I was the chief financial  officer, CFO, of Shannon Group, where I led the development and implementation of the business plan to consolidate, turnaround, refocus and transform the group and its businesses.  I commenced a &euro;100 million capital investment programme, raised debt from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, for the runway rehabilitation, supported the growth of passengers by 22% and visitors by 29% over three years until the end of 2016, and I rationalised the cost base and improved the profitability of Shannon Group.  I left the group after three and a half years to return to Dublin and I now work as a management consultant specialising in corporate development, M&amp;A deal making, and corporate finance.<\/p> <p>  Prior to working in the Shannon Group, I worked for six years with Indaver, a leading European high tech renewable energy and waste to energy incineration group, as a general manager and finance director.  My key achievement was the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s first incinerator near Drogheda, at a cost of &euro;150 million, which has since transformed the Irish waste management sector.  Between 2001 and 2008, I worked as a specialist on infrastructure development deals, mainly public private partnerships, notably two major Irish toll roads, a major waste water, private finance initiative, PFI, project in Northern Ireland and mixed urban redevelopment projects.  Prior to that, I spent six years at NCB Stockbrokers advising on corporate transactions.  I worked at board level with Shannon Group.  I was a board member at Indaver and I am also currently a non-executive director of Bus &Eacute;ireann and I chair its audit and risk committee.  I brought my skills and experience to bear recently to help Bus &Eacute;ireann restructure and to put it on a sustainable footing.  I developed my knowledge of corporate governance undertaking courses at the Institute of Directors.  I was involved with IBEC, Mid West, on its committee and Shannon Chamber while at Shannon Group.  <\/p> <p>  On a personal front, my motivation in accepting this appointment is to be a good leader and to make a lasting contribution to the company and the region.  I have an affinity with the communities and understanding of the issues and challenges of the west and south of the country, having worked in Shannon and lived in Quin and having grown up in and worked in Cork.  I have extended family living in Kerry, Clare and Cork.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my approach and vision as chairperson, the Shannon Foynes Port Company is responsible for the maritime management of the Shannon Estuary, serving a number of facilities and customers and handling in excess of 11 million tonnes per annum. Shannon Foynes port is the second largest port in the State in terms of total tonnage and profitability and the third largest in terms of turnover.  Connectivity and port capacity are two key themes on which I will focus as chairperson.  In particular, the national ports policy classified the port as a port of national significance.  The port has been also recognised in a European context as being a core port under EU TEN-T guidelines.  I see Shannon Foynes port as having a vital national significance and not just a mid-west significance.  It is critical, therefore, that Shannon Foynes Port Company continues to be run and developed on commercial grounds and that it also recognises the varying interests of all stakeholders in the development and implementation of its strategic plan to deliver increased connectivity and capacity for trade and investment.  The draft national planning framework supports the role of the tier 1 ports and the Limerick to Foynes road upgrade.  I will also focus on re-opening the rail connection from Foynes to Limerick to facilitate mainline rail connectivity and industrial development.<\/p> <p>  My approach as chairperson will be to work with the board of directors, and through the CEO and his management team, on all aspects of the business.  I will focus on good governance ensuring operational excellence and the development and progressive implementation of a strategy to secure investment and growth in the business.  This strategy, where appropriate, will be complementary to and supportive of the overall development of the region and co-ordinated with Government and its agencies' plans to develop the port as a national asset and enabler of socio-economic development of significant scale in such areas as energy, natural resources, agriculture, manufacturing and processing.  My initial meeting with the CEO of the company has been reassuring that a focused and professional approach is in place and my objective is to contribute to building and consolidating this approach. <\/p> <p>  In terms of business strategic vision, the shipping sector is becoming more globalised.  Shannon Foynes Port Company's business strategy must, therefore, identify, pursue and deliver new global opportunities and expand the scale of its existing activities to ensure its growth and survival.  Global business development and investment are also key themes that I will focus on as chairperson.  Shannon Foynes Port Company has an ambitious strategic plan set out in its master plan vision 2041 document.  This master plan covers the growth and development options for the port for the 30 year period to 2041.  The sustainable implementation of the master plan encompasses capacity and land optimisation, transport and multi-modal connectivity, society and  community integration along with environmental considerations.  The capital expenditure programme in the master plan is projected to involve an investment of some &euro;1.8 billion, of which the port company will invest &euro;126 million.  This will position Shannon Foynes port to capture ongoing growth and new global sources of growth, foreign direct investment, FDI, and support economic and social development in which I keenly believe.  The development of infrastructure at Foynes port in tandem with the Limerick to Foynes road scheme and rail line will add significant capacity and direct alternative connectivity to and from Europe and the rest of the world enabling the Shannon Foynes Port Company to compete and capture global business opportunities.  This infrastructure capacity and direct connectivity will reduce uncertainty and potential customs delays caused by Brexit as the infrastructure now being developed at Shannon Foynes port could facilitate direct multi-modal links to Europe and beyond by completely bypassing the UK land bridge.  In addition, this realignment of the supply chain toward Foynes port leverages the substantial Government road investments, undertaken and planned.  I also will be focused on the development of Limerick Docks and alternative uses for its surplus lands.<\/p> <p>  My approach is to ensure good corporate governance, meeting or exceeding the shareholder expectations for a dividend - financial, economic or social - and to have a realistic strategic plan which adds tangible benefits to its many stakeholders.<\/p><p>My ambition is to deliver this in the context of a strong unified board working in harmony with the CEO and his team, with good relationships and support from the appropriate external bodies and working co-operatively and transparently with the local community, businesses and other stakeholders.<\/p><p> That summarises my vision, approach and career experience.  I will be happy to take questions on any aspects of those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which is meeting next door so I will have to leave.  I might not be able to stay for the responses but I will note them when I get them.<\/p> <p>  I warmly welcome Mr. McGarry and congratulate him on his appointment.  I know a great deal about Shannon Foynes Port Company because, in one guise or another, I was a director on the River Shannon from the days of the old harbour commissioners up to when I was elected to the Seanad.  I did that for 16 years so I am familiar with the company.  The Shannon Foynes Port Company is very important infrastructure not just for the mid-west but for the nation.  I have nothing but admiration for the work being done there by Mr. McGarry, his predecessor, the chief executive, Pat Keating, and the board members.  It is a fantastic facility and a great working environment.  It is not far from the Kerry border and many of my constituents have secured good, meaningful, long-term employment there.  We always say that what is good for Foynes is good for Kerry.<\/p> <p>  The rail link between Limerick and Foynes is very important for the growth of the harbour.  I wish Mr. McGarry well with that.  I have a question about Foynes Island.  I am out of touch now but it had been suggested that Foynes Island might be acquired by the port company to give it further potential.  What is the position with that?  Is there a possibility of movement on that, if the company does not have it already?  It would be important to secure more space.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the gas project.  People in Kerry had been very hopeful about the liquefied natural gas, LNG, project for a long time but there has been some disappointing news of late.  Foynes has a huge role to play in the provision of gas and ensuring our energy security into the future.  Will Mr. McGarry comment on the current position of Foynes on that project and how he sees it growing in terms of a storage facility for gas into the future?  I welcome the fact that there is now a gas supply line directly to Listowel, where I am from, from Foynes.  The Kerry Group is very involved with that as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. McGarry well.  The reports about him are very good.  I will note his responses in the report of these proceedings.  I must go to attend an important meeting of the other committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#C00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McGarry.  His curriculum vitae is quite impressive.  He has built up a vast amount of experience during his working life, which is welcome.  I admire the reasons he wishes to return and give something back to this company.<\/p><p>Was the position advertised on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>?  Did Mr. McGarry apply for the job through <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>?  If so, did he have to undergo any interviews and, if so, how many?<\/p><p>I have been on this committee for almost two years and this is possibly the first time the marine sector has been before the committee.  Sometimes we forget about it but it is an important industry.  In 2012, it had a turnover of &euro;4.2 billion and was a net contributor of &euro;1.3 billion to our GDP, which is almost 0.7% of GDP.  That is extremely important, no more so than now in the context of Brexit and the need for improved connectivity for our agrifood, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.  Mr. McGarry referred to the Limerick-Foynes rail line.  Representatives of Irish Rail appeared before the committee a few weeks ago when they identified, and we know it from national media reports, the serious and precarious financial situation of the company.  Has Mr. McGarry had any interaction with them?  Is this a pipe dream or is it realistic?  There is also the upgrade of the Limerick to Foynes road.  The port is part of the TEN-T network.  Could Irish Rail and Transport Infrastructure Ireland avail of EU funding to help advance both of these projects?<\/p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the LNG project.  This nation is 95% dependent on the UK for gas supply.  Even in 2025 we will still be 85% dependent on the UK.  Has the port made provision for importing liquefied natural gas?  What is it doing with regard to its role in the storage of natural gas?  A few months ago the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, indicated that both the import and storage of liquefied natural gas are under serious consideration by his Department.  The European Commission produced a paper a number of years ago entitled Europe's Seaports 2030: Challenges Ahead.  One of the challenges is predicted high growth.  With even modest assumptions of economic growth port cargo volumes are expected to increase by 50% by 2030.  It is even more for the fast growing traffic of containers.  How is the port equipped to deal with the prediction of high growth?  The paper also refers to the challenges of the nature of shipping, with the size and complexity of the fleet increasing.  Ultra large container ships are appearing as well as new types of roll-on\/roll-off ferries and gas containers.  Energy trades are changing, with a shift from oil and refined products towards gas, and there is the deployment of bigger vessels for short sea shipping.  How does Mr. McGarry think his port is equipped to deal with the changing nature of shipping?<\/p><p>The paper produced by the EU Commission included an action plan with eight specified actions.  I am sure Mr. McGarry is aware of it.  Will he comment on how he proposes to implement those actions or are all of them relevant to the port?<\/p><p>How does the port comply with the new International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, weight certification from the International Maritime Organisation?<\/p><p>I have a question about Mr. McGarry's role on the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  How long was he a member of the board?  He said he is pleased with how he contributed to the restructuring of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, we read in the newspapers yesterday that there is potential for further strike action in Bus &Eacute;ireann due to some of the restructuring of which he was pleased to be a part.  I am not trying to lay the blame on Mr. McGarry exclusively.  We accept that something had to be done with Bus &Eacute;ireann, but it is still not resolved.  It is still a big issue.  While the maritime industry has not been on the committee's agenda for two years, Bus &Eacute;ireann certainly was.  It is an issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people daily.  Perhaps Mr. McGarry will share his insights with the committee on how, as a member of the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann, he envisages it being put on a sustainable footing and also on how to get buy-in from the people we rely on to ensure that Bus &Eacute;ireann is effective, reliable and fit for purpose in terms of serving the passengers who rely on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#C00500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1389,"content":"<p>There were plenty of questions.

I am sure it will be looked at again.  The board of the port is monitoring the situation.  It is not going ahead at the moment but there is potential to look at it again in the future.

The NTA has a wide range of specific functions relating to public transport, which may be summarised as: strategic planning of transport in the greater Dublin area; infrastructure development, including developing an integrated public transport network, and providing bus fleets, and cycling facilities; regulatory functions, including the licensing of taxis and hackneys, and the licensing of commercial bus passenger services; procuring subsidised public transport services; managing the rural transport programme; promoting public transport, including integrated ticketing, fares, and information; and various other related functions.  It is a wide-ranging remit, and touches on almost everyone's life in one way or another.<\/p> <p>  My own background includes a decade as CEO of the National Roads Authority so that I come to this position with a reasonable knowledge of the transportation arena, and of the role of the NTA within the State structure.

At that time, there were significant sums being invested in the road infrastructure and one can see the benefits.  We are reaping the benefits of it.  Certainly, it is much easier to get around the country than it was in the past.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry is now looking to move into a new role.  In Mr. Barry's view, is it the National Transport Authority's role to devise or implement policy?  Often there is a tendency for State companies, such as Dublin Bus, CI&Eacute; or Irish Rail, to state that they are only implementing the role of the National Transport Authority and sometimes political personnel can deflect matters to the National Transport Authority.  My belief is that it is the job of the Members of the D&aacute;il to bring forward policy and it is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority to implement that policy.  I would welcome Mr. Barry's opinion on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry quite rightly identified that transport faces many challenges, not least the challenge of how to ensure that we have a proper integrated public transport network that will be environmentally friendly, energy efficient, affordable and reliable.  I ask Mr. Barry's opinion in that regard, as every Government, be it this one or the next one, will have a limited pot of funding.  How does Mr. Barry envisage being able to meet the challenges of public transport from a financial perspective?  When he was CEO of the NRA, Mr. Barry used, one might say, quite rightly, public private partnerships to the maximum benefit.  Can public private partnerships be used to a greater extent to fund the much needed investment in infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry cited strategy planning.  One of the big issues we face now is homelessness, the lack of affordable housing and sustainable development in the housing sector.  Transport has a pivotal role to play in addressing these challenges and I would welcome Mr. Barry's opinion on that.<\/p> <p>  Cycling is not often mentioned but anyone who commutes in and out of Dublin city sees the significant increase in the number who have taken up cycling as their preferred mode of transport.  Less than 1% of the overall national budget is attributable to cycling.  Is that right?

Last night I raised with the Minister the issue that there are almost 93,000 households in rural Ireland that do not have access to rail, bus, hackney or taxi.  That is a hell of a lot of people who face near isolation.  What are Mr. Barry's plans to address that?<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to ask what percentage of the current bus fleet of coaches, in particular, the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet, has disability access, whether it be lifts, ramps, etc.  I attended a disability rights forum last weekend in Drogheda where it was highlighted that coaches do not have to be wheelchair accessible or do not have to comply with the regulation.  If that is the case, why is it still so?<\/p> <p>  Another issue raised was that the disability access standards on the Enterprise trains are far more up to scratch.<\/p><p>There seems to be a lot more thought put into turning room and the layout, in that when a person in a wheelchair boards the train it is easier for them to manoeuvre and position themselves, in comparison with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann trains.  Has the National Transport Authority examined the Enterprise trains and how they model their disability access? This comes from users and their experiences.  Has the NTA done this comparison and if not, why has it not done so and will it happen? I am sure Mr. Barry realises there are problems in this regard.<\/p><p> I also want to ask Mr. Barry about the plans for the further privatisation of bus and rail services.  I am sure he will say it is not privatisation and that it is outsourcing.  There is not a whole lot of difference between the two.  What are the plans, outside of the 10% of bus routes?  There is also a lot of disquiet around the Go-Ahead contracts and the fact that given it is using taxpayers money, the public and public representatives cannot have access to the contract.  There is concern around decisions for awarding the contract.  According to reports, the Bus &Eacute;ireann tender came in cheaper than the Go-Ahead bid.  I believe there are also various reports regarding the Go-Ahead delivery of services.  These are conflicting reports but from what we hear they are not all 100%.  When will we get sight of the reasons, the costs of awarding the contract to Go-Ahead and why the decision was made to award the contract to Go-Ahead as opposed to our national fleet in Bus &Eacute;ireann?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#F01000","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1446,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Troy's questions first about who sets the policy.  It is the Oireachtas and the Minister who set strategic policy.  An organisation such as the NTA would certainly have a policy setting role, but that would be subsidiary to the policy set by the Government or the Minister.  I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the NTA should be trying to develop or implement policies that run counter to the policies of the Government.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the issue of public transport and the affordability of investment in the role of public private partnerships, PPPs.  As the Chairman is aware, I have had considerable involvement with PPPs in my time with the National Roads Authority.  PPPs generally worked well in those circumstances because they allowed us to build roads that otherwise would not have been built.  The point is well made that it is cheaper for the State to borrow as the State, than it is for any subsidiary State agency to generate or borrow money through a PPP offering.  There is sometimes a question in this regard.  If, because of the constraints on a government's fiscal space or EU rules and so on, one cannot borrow the money through national borrowing, then one is looking at whether money could be borrowed effectively through a PPP.  In those circumstances, the need for the investment and the return on it would have to be significantly greater than the cost through the PPP.  If State funding is available it is lower cost funding to the public than PPP funding.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the role of transport on housing, I believe the NTA has a particular role.  The NTA is responsible for the integration of transport and land use, planning with all the local authorities and the strategic transport planning in the Dublin area.  In regard to local authority county or area plans into which the NTA has an input, when the local authority is planning where the housing is to go and how it is to be developed, it is important this is done in conjunction with the NTA so that development of the transport and the housing goes hand in glove and when the housing is developed that there is transport for the people.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy made reference to the increasing numbers of people who cycle.  I include myself in that increase.  I do not know all the details of the NTA's cycling development plans.  I do, however, know they are looking at developing some 200 km of cycle ways in the greater Dublin area.  If this is done it will be a significant help in developing cycling.  Cycling facilities, especially within urban areas, are at a much lower standard than we would all like them to be.  The mingling of heavy traffic and cycling in particular is inherently dangerous.  We would all like to see an evolution of segregated cycling lanes with time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1447,"content":"<p>That would be safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1448,"content":"<p>Deputy Munster asked a number of detailed questions.  Because I am not actually in the job yet I do not have detailed answers for her on those issues.  Where I do not have a detailed response I will get back to the Deputy on it.  I shall comment generally on her questions.  Providing disability access in public transport is absolutely essential.  If there are areas where there is a better disability service provided - such as on the Enterprise  - than on other trains then we should certainly examine what can be done to move to the higher standard on those trains.<\/p> <p>  I am surprised to hear there are coaches being licensed that do not have to comply with the regulations.  Because it is news to me I cannot give Deputy Munster a response on that.  I expect that, if we are not at the point where all coaches are required to comply with disability access, we are moving in that direction.  I would expect that to be the case.<\/p> <p>  Whether or not a service is to be privatised is a matter for government policy rather than NTA policy.  That is a strategic policy position.  I am not aware of any.  In the interviews I went through, before arriving at this position, nobody raised the question of privatisation with me.  That matter is for the Government.  I have no particular agenda in that area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to outsourcing, I believe that competition is very healthy.  I spent most of my working life in the private sector, competing for work.  That made us more efficient and better at the job.  Not everything is suitable for outsourcing but when it is done in the right place I believe it is okay.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked also about plans to go outside the 10% level of outsourcing.  I am not aware of the plans but again because I am coming in to the job there may be plans about which I am not familiar.  As we sit here at the moment I am not aware of anything beyond that.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that Go-Ahead was awarded the contract for 10% of the bus routes but I do not know the details of the Go-Ahead contract.  I do not have the details of past contracts awarded by the NTA.  I assume that Go-Ahead won because it met the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criteria.  I believe we are all aware that under the EU rules for public tenders, the most economically advantageous tender has to govern.  Deputy Munster asked why it was Go-Ahead rather than the national carrier.  When it is a competitive situation, no matter how much one might want to give it to one party or a national carrier, under the current procurement laws that is not allowed.  That is the law as we have it.  This does not give the Deputy any details on the contract, but I do not have any details on the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1449,"content":"<p>I would like a written response to all of the questions I have asked, including the disability access issue compared to the Enterprise service, the access to coaches, the reasons the contract was given to Go-Ahead above Bus &Eacute;ireann and if we cannot see details of the contract, why not?

They also look at his CV and see that Mr. Barry was involved in &euro;3 billion of private investment in roads through public private partnerships.  We have a very particular situation in Bus &Eacute;ireann at the moment and I am going to concentrate in my comments on that.  We have a ballot for strike action if the company tries to implement unilateral changes to rosters from next Sunday.  This is an immediate situation.  I said I would try to be the voice of bus workers and I make no apology for reading a few quotes from bus workers as reported by <i>thejournal.ie <\/i>on the current situation with rosters.  The first is from a bus worker:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Look, this is all coming from the NTA (National Transport Association),&quot; one source said.  &quot;They contact Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, etc, and say that Behaviour and Attitudes surveys say we need more services.  So you get the NX (Navan Expressway, launched on 19 September) launched to great fanfare.  They tell us to provide it.  But the company hasn't sat down to see whether or not we actually can provide it.  Do we have the buses?  Do we have the drivers?  The answer is no we don't, and it's knocked the whole applecart in the region.<\/blockquote> <p>The second excerpt is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Lads are doing 12-14 hour shifts and then being told to walk back to the depot.  Fellas are starting to walk out on the job.  There's no work life balance now,&quot; says one driver.  &quot;The company says it wants efficiency,&quot; says another.  &quot;Well, so do we.  But it&rsquo;s all very well aiming for 84% efficiency in driving.  That leaves no room for efficiency in family life.  There's no work\/life balance.  What are the younger drivers with families supposed to do?&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>The last excerpt from the article is a short one:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;At any one time Broadstone is short 100 buses per day,&quot; one source says.  &quot;And on a day towards the end of October there were 45 private operators in use.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>The general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union, Mr. Dermot O'Leary, has said these are oppressive and unworkable conditions.  I put it to Mr. Barry that what the NTA has done is set Bus &Eacute;ireann up to fail.  There have been 120 redundancies and trying to organise rosters for new routes, such as the Navan one, means that either the workers are crucified or private operators are brought in or, as is being done now, a bit of both.  The unions and the workers, who are the people who drive the buses every day and know more about the running of a bus company than anyone in the management, in my opinion, have put forward alternative suggestions on the way rosters might be organised.  Alternative suggestion after alternative suggestion has been shot down and we are now on the verge of a dispute.  I put it to Mr. Barry that it looks very much as though the situation has been set up to fail.  Is this an attempt to bring Bus &Eacute;ireann into disrepute in the eyes of the public and to further a privatisation agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#H00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>I cannot make any comment on the detail of much of what Deputy Barry has just said.

If there were to be a move to privatisation, it would be a strategic policy issue for Government.  I am not aware of the NTA having a privatisation issue.  The NTA has sought and will probably continue to seek outsourcing and competition.  Where there are subsidies, the NTA will seek value for money as it will where there is competition for services and that is fair enough.

I welcome Mr. Barry and the opportunity to engage with him.  My interest as a Senator, first thing in the morning and last thing at night, is the inclusion of people with disabilities.  That is the mandate I sought and, thankfully, the mandate I got.  We have a public sector duty on foot of equality legislation to provide public services for all of the public.  Ireland has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it is intended to ratify that.  It copperfastens the public sector duty towards people with disabilities.  The convention contains articles on free and easy access to public transport in all its different domains and modalities.  That is where I am coming from.<\/p> <p>   Like other Members of the Oireachtas, I receive contact regarding, and am very much aware from my work of, issues people with disabilities experience on a pretty constant basis, without over-egging it, of failing to access public transport, whether it is taxis, city bus services, regional bus services and trains.  Buses in particular are an issue, including the national bus fleet, Dublin Bus and contracted services.  The first and foremost obligation of the chairman of the NTA is around the governance of the organisation.  I am clearly stating that part of that governance and its linchpin is that it is a public service for all of the public.  It is a stretch to provide that but it is a commitment we have made and, in any event, it is what public services are supposed to be about.  I am concerned that places outside Dublin - beyond the Pale, to use that old term - do not get a fair shake when it comes to public transport.  There is the issue of the quantum of it but there is also a requirement for the NTA to ensure that it is even handed when making decisions to improve services for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  A young woman of 20, who is a wheelchair user, has come to me.  She went through all her schooling and has been supported to go to college.  In fairness, the State has put a decent investment into her education.  The fly in the ointment for her is that 20 times in 2017 alone, having booked and given advance notice, she was let down either on the outward journey or on the way back.  She cannot put her hand on her heart and say to a prospective employer or place where she is doing a project that she will be there for an interview.  Mr. Barry knows exactly what I am saying.  My point is that public transport is not an either-or thing.  It stands between that young woman and the possibility of a future.  She either goes one way or back the other way.  I am not trying to nag, but it is a critical issue for people.  I have given just one example but there are many others.  That is why I am passionate and strong about this.<\/p><p>During the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike earlier this year, Bus &Eacute;ireann took services off three routes.  The National Transport Authority told the world there was no problem with that and sufficient service was provided by private licensed operators.

There were sufficient seats to put bums on but all the Bus &Eacute;ireann buses that were taken off the route were wheelchair accessible and none of the remaining buses was accessible nor were any required, under the licence, to be accessible.  Whether the provider is public or private, it is unacceptable, if it is a public service, for the person with a disability who wants to go from A to B to have to worry who the provider is.  It should be equally accessible if it is a public service.<\/p> <p>  That still leaves us shy of the issue of whether those accessible buses would be available as accessible stock on the day of the outward or return journey, which brings us to this issue of the notice period.  We can change our minds.  Someone could get a phone call tonight that a relative is not well or such, say that there is a bus at a certain time in the morning and that he or she will get it.  A disabled person, using a wheelchair, cannot do that but has to wait two days with crossed fingers.  That is a huge issue as is the one of people who are blind or deaf being able to have advance notice of where they are on the journey and what the next stop is.  The whole service is patchy in that regard and is not up to the mark.  There is a range of issues.  I could go on.
