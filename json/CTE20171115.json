I am registered with the Irish College of General Practitioners as a contraceptive tutor and a tutor in the provision of long-acting reversible contraception.  I am a member of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health and the Irish Association of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Providers.<\/p> <p>  I have been the medical director of the Irish Family Planning Association since 2008.  The IFPA is Ireland's leading sexual health charity.  It promotes the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health information and dedicated, confidential and affordable health care.  We operate two not-for-profit medical clinics where we deliver services, including contraception, post-abortion medical check-ups, cervical screenings, and screenings for sexually transmitted infections.  We also have ten centres nationwide where we provide free pregnancy counselling and post-abortion counselling services. <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I work in the context of an extremely restrictive legal framework, principally, the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  We are also bound by two pieces of legislation that include criminal sanctions, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and the Abortion Information Act.  Navigating these complex legal barriers while trying to maintain a caring clinical relationship is an immense challenge for us as health care providers.<\/p> <p>  This presentation will address the socio-economic dimensions of crisis pregnancy, and the impacts of current Irish law on women who experience an unintended pregnancy or a pregnancy that has become a crisis for other reasons.  I have included case vignettes in appendix one to this submission to further illustrate women's decision-making.  I am happy to expand on issues raised in these afterwards.   <\/p> <p>  An unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence among women of reproductive age.  While for some women this is a joyful and welcome situation, for many it is a traumatic and devastating life event.  Conversely, a wanted or planned pregnancy can become a crisis.  An unintended pregnancy can mean the difference between a woman determining her own future or seeing her plans derailed and her aspirations frustrated. <\/p> <p>  In 2016, more than 3,000 women and girls gave Irish addresses at UK abortion clinics.  These women were from all walks of life and from every county in Ireland.  In addition, as Dr. Abigail Aiken explained in an earlier session, women are increasingly accessing the abortion pill online.<\/p> <p>  Clients of IFPA doctors and pregnancy counsellors include women who have made a decision to have an abortion for a wide range of reasons related to their physical and mental health and well-being, and their ability to cope with a pregnancy.  The majority of our clients who consider abortion do so because to continue an unintended pregnancy would be an intolerable burden at this time in their life.  Any meaningful change from the current legal situation must include these women.<\/p> <p>  Each woman weighs up her particular circumstances very carefully before deciding that she is unable to cope with a pregnancy.  The factors a woman considers include the following: her family situation; her income; her social support networks; her plans for education; her working conditions; and her social and physical environments in terms of housing, relationships and so on.  Many women in this situation already have children.  They know what it means to be a mother.  For them, the need to care for their children is the primary reason that they decide not to continue with another pregnancy.  A woman may be trapped in an abusive relationship, or fear that continuing the pregnancy will trap her and her children into a lifelong relationship with an abuser. <\/p> <p>  Pregnancy counselling services, such as the IFPA, can support women through their decision-making and give them information about abortion services.  Increasingly, our clients are women who experience multiple forms of disadvantage which, in turn, restrict access to abortion.  Indeed, the term \"socio-economic\" masks the reality that an unintended pregnancy can have devastating impacts on a woman's life and that of her family. <\/p> <p>  Once a woman in Ireland has made the decision to have an abortion, she is faced with a range of further obstacles and difficulties.  Cost will be a significant factor in the decision of almost every woman.  She will need to consider the practical supports available to her and ask herself the following questions.  Can she organise child care?  Can she get a sick certificate from her doctor?  Can her partner get time off to accompany her?  As a migrant woman, is she legally able to leave the country?  Will she be able to navigate the immigration procedures?  If she has a disability, how will this impact on her ability to access care?  Not everyone lives in Dublin or Cork.  Women who live at a distance from the major cities, particularly if they are dependent on public transport, may have a very lengthy journey to an airport if they decide to travel to the UK for a safe and legal abortion.  Clearly, this constitutes a further significant barrier.  For minors, all of these matters are immensely more complicated. <\/p> <p>  Non-judgmental, non-directive counselling by a trained professional can be a huge support to a woman at this time, but it is no substitute for access to services.  We cannot ignore the fact that socio-economic factors frequently determine whether a woman travels for a legal abortion or resigns herself to the reality that her only option is an illegal abortion.  For some women, the obstacles are insurmountable and they are forced to continue the pregnancy against their wishes. <\/p> <p>  When abortion is criminalised, as it is in Ireland, the burden of accessing care falls on the woman rather than the health care system.  This is because, whether a woman travels abroad for legal services or has an illegal abortion in Ireland, she must leave the mainstream health care service.  Her experience will not meet international health care standards such as those of the World Health Organization and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. <\/p> <p>  If a woman decides to travel for abortion, the information Act prohibits her doctor from making a referral to services in another State, even if she does not speak English, has a poor educational level or has an underlying medical condition.  Unlike any other medical treatment situation, the continuum of care is broken.  The onus shifts to the patient to make contact with a doctor outside of Ireland and to provide her medical history.  She must make her way to a private medical facility in another country without the supports that apply in other situations where people travel for health care.<\/p> <p>  A woman who is unable to travel, or for other reasons opts for an illegal abortion, is faced with the challenge of trying to find a reliable online provider without medical assistance.  She also risks prosecution under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act if she self-induces abortion, as does anyone who assists her.  In either scenario, an underlying medical condition that is easily managed in the context of legal abortion may become more risky.<\/p> <p>  Yet another way in which care falls below acceptable standards is a lack of contraceptive provision.  As Professor Arulkumaran told this committee, best practice in the context of where abortion is legal is that contraception is offered as part of integrated abortion care at the initial presentation and the post-abortion consultation.  For women in Ireland, this is not the case.  This may be because her first presentation is not with a doctor, and so she does not have immediate access to contraceptive information.  Online abortion pill providers are not in a position to provide ongoing contraception.  I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception, which are the most effective.  <\/p> <p>  All of these failures of care are related to the disruption and fragmentation of care in the context of restrictive criminal abortion laws.  We see this also in relation to post-abortion care.  Women who can access abortion in their own country have a clear post-abortion care pathway with the same provider.  In the event of complications, there are robust and timely pathways for referral, as recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG.  This is not the case for women who travel from Ireland.  While free post-abortion care is funded by the HSE, and available to women from providers such as the IFPA, our experience is that only a small number of women avail of it.<\/p><p>Women who access illegal abortions receive a still lower standard of care.  In addition to the fragmented care pathway, they risk inadvertently accessing medication from an unreliable online source which could be inactive, inadequate or potentially harmful.  In my clinical experience, women accessing medication online tend to report problems late.  Fear of prosecution is a real deterrent to accessing health care for some of these women.<\/p><p> A substantial number of women are accessing abortion in this way.  As Dr. Aiken made clear, most women experience relief at the availability of this option, but that is not to say that it is acceptable health care.  It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.<\/p><p> In considering the real health concerns associated with the criminalisation of abortion, we must not forget the impact of stigma on women.  Research by the American Psychological Association has found that feelings of stigma, perceived need for secrecy, exposure to anti-abortion picketing and low perceived or anticipated social support for the abortion decision negatively impact women&rsquo;s post-abortion psychological experiences.  Every day, IFPA counsellors hear from women about these experiences.  Women&rsquo;s privacy and informed consent are invaded in ways that do not happen when services are locally available.  Some women must make multiple disclosures of a private and personal health situation to, for example, community welfare officers, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, staff in direct provision centres and social workers.  Decisions made at this level can turn obstacles into barriers.  Women&rsquo;s dignity is violated at every step.  Their right to confidentiality is taken from them so many times, right up to the moment when they find themselves in taxis from airports to abortion clinics with women they do not know. <\/p><p> In conclusion, our legal system imposes a significant burden on women at a time of crisis and stress in their lives.  It criminalises women and health care providers.  All women are disadvantaged and discriminated against when they are forced to travel to another state to access abortion services, and even more so if they access illegal abortion.  The requirement to travel for abortion forces a reduced quality of care on women.  Again, this is even more the case with illegal abortion.  We have an urgent need for safe and legal abortion care in this country.  This means equitable access, regardless of socio-economic status, to high quality, affordable, local services in Ireland that respect women&rsquo;s autonomy and decision making.  As a society, we must take responsibility for ensuring that this becomes a reality in law and in health care practice.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I am happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The usual issue that arises is that the woman will have been delayed.  There will have been several appointments and she will have been delayed in seeking care.  Obviously, we do not know if some women are deterred completely because if that is the case, we will not see them.  However, the counsellors see women who have had negative experiences in such agencies.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the socio-economic effects on mental health, particularly in respect of pregnancy, socio-economic factors and mental health are very much intertwined in every aspect of life.  Sometimes the socio-economic burden of an unintended pregnancy can have a negative effect on somebody's mental health.  It becomes very difficult to separate those issues because in most such cases, many different issues are present.  Obviously, if somebody is concerned about, perhaps, an abusive partner, this becomes much more likely and it is more likely that her mental health will suffer if she is in a pregnancy she feels she cannot manage.  The two issues are very much intertwined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>With regard to some of the examples the witness provided to the committee in the appendix, she spoke about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and some of the difficulties that has presented.

If somebody presents and one feels there is a possibility she might qualify for an abortion under the Act, one cannot have any certainty about that.  One can only say to her that there is a possibility that she might be considered for an abortion under the Act.  One can explain the procedures, which are that she will have to be seen first by an obstetrician and then either by another obstetrician or another physician or two psychiatrists for a decision to be reached.  If somebody is suffering from mental ill health, for example, it is quite likely she will be attending a psychiatrist already.  She might have already disclosed that and she has now disclosed her situation to a counsellor or a doctor.  The prospect of having to go through three more similar investigations with another medical person is off-putting for her.  Our experience, and it is not huge because not many women will qualify under the Act anyway, is that where these issues arise, the woman will choose to travel if she has the means.  She does not want to have the uncertainty and the rigour of having to go through the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will save the remainder of the Deputy's time for the next session.

The presentation was absolutely excellent.  I was struck by Dr. Henchion's comment that unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence.  This committee has spent a great deal of time considering circumstances of rape, fatal foetal abnormality and the woman's health.  In the experience of the IFPA, the majority of women who decide to access abortion would not fit into those categories.  Perhaps she will expand on that and, by implication, what that means for this committee.

The vast majority of them are far more complex and involve many socio-economic factors.  As to what those factors are, there are as many different sets of circumstances as there are women.  Various combinations of factors occur.  It might be a young woman who is still in education or very early on a career path who does not have the support of a partner and who feels she will damage her future by continuing with the pregnancy.  It might be an older woman who has children and has just got back into the workplace.  As in the first vignette I gave, there might be financial difficulties for that family that they are trying to get through and they feel another pregnancy would stop them being able to get their lives back on track.<\/p><p>We have some women with very severe forms of disadvantage.  For example, some women are battling addiction and might have children in care.  They are on a pathway out of addiction and have accessed services.  They have succeeded in keeping sober.  They just feel that the mental health toll of a pregnancy and the fact of having another baby might put their goal of getting their plans back on track out of their reach.  There are a vast number of different situations that occur.  Trying to set out a list of conditions that would fulfil a socio-economic criteria  is unrealistic.  The only way to deal with that is to have some sort of open access so that these conditions can be met.  Whether the committee decides to put gestational limits in place for that is a matter for the Government.  To ask women to meet certain criteria does not recognise the complexity of the issue in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Two things are apparent to me but I do not want to put words in the mouth of Dr. Henchion.

When I am at work in my clinic I provide contraception for a good part of my day, which is fine.  I can only see the people who make it in to see me.  That means the women must know that a contraceptive service is available, be able to afford contraception services and know where to access them.  First, one needs good quality education and awareness programmes so that women are aware of contraceptive methods and where to access them.<\/p> <p>  Second, one must remove the financial barrier.  Without question there is a financial barrier.  A person with a medical card can access services for free.  However, a person on the cusp of not having a medical card who is not well off cannot access services.  I have seen what happens when women seek long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, such as the Mirena coil or whatever.  They are really interested and want it because they want to be very safe.  Quite often, when I outline the cost to them they defer their decision.  Unfortunately, some of those women end up using much less safe methods.

To be perfectly honest, I cannot see why anybody inserted a 14-year prison sentence unless one wanted it to have a chilling effect.  That seems obvious.  As a group, doctors are very anxious about anything that would damage their reputation in any way.  Being associated with potential criminal charges, even if one is not sent to prison, is a huge threat and definitely influences people in the way they manage consultations.  It means that instead of a doctor being comfortable and free in his or her discussion with somebody one is continually, in one's mind, trying to be guarded and careful about anything one might say that could possibly be interpreted as not being in keeping with the law.  Decriminalisation would take away that layer yet one still can have lots of ethical and clinical guidelines.  The Medical Council is still in a position to sanction doctors who have been found to have behaved inappropriately.  It should not mean that people think doctors will somehow behave badly if there is no criminal sanction.

As the Deputy said, this has been investigated by the HSE and a file was sent to the DPP and there has been no evidence of wrongdoing found.  I do not know that one can say we did anything wrong in this situation.

I spoke last week about Marie Stopes paying bonuses to staff members to encourage people to have abortions.  That is totally wrong.<\/p> <p>   The witness has talked about how a woman who travelled abroad for an abortion will not be able to bring her medical history with her.  Medical history is very important so that a doctor can treat a woman properly.  If she has any complications or problems, he knows exactly what he can do because he has the records.  If women who went to Irish Family Planning Association clinics followed the advice they got there and told doctors they had a miscarriage instead of an abortion it would mean giving false medical history and if any complications cropped up, doctors would not be able to treat them properly because they would not be aware they had had an abortion.  Given that medical history is very important, why were counsellors in Irish Family Planning Association clinics telling women they could give false information to their doctors.  How can the organisation tell us women's health is very important?  I am very disappointed.  People do not just make these things up.  People went in looking for advice from the services.

I think the Chair said she is \"indebted to Deputy Rabbitte\" for her comments about the non-appearance before the committee of certain pro-life invitees.  To judge by the letters sent in by two of them, they did not want to be used in a tokenistic way by a committee that had already made up its mind that the eighth amendment must be changed or removed.  That was a significant decision to take without hearing all the evidence.  The response of the invitees in question was very understandable.

In light of that, I want to go back to some of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  An expos&eacute; that was reported on in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>a few years ago was done by a group of women who had anecdotal or personal experience of having abortions or who knew women who subsequently came to regret their decisions and felt they had been badly and, in some ways, illegally advised by counselling agencies in receipt of funding from the State.  This is a very serious matter.  It was investigated by the Garda.  The evidence showed that women were told to hide their abortions from their own doctors on five occasions.  In four of those five cases, it was IFPA counsellors who told them to do so.  In one case, a woman was told that if complications arose after a surgical abortion in Britain, she needed to tell medical staff in hospitals that she had had a miscarriage.  Nothing was said to her about whether she would be criminalised.  There was no evidence that this would ever happen.  I think the strong understanding of people is that it would never happen.  She was simply told she needed to tell medical staff she had had a miscarriage, as opposed to an abortion.<\/p><p>The then Master of the Rotunda Hospital, Professor Sam Coulter-Smith, criticised the danger surrounding this type of advice.  He said that complications during an abortion procedure could result in perforation of the uterus, which could be life-threatening if not known to the woman's doctor.  I put it to the IFPA that this was the action of a rogue agency.  It did not just happen once; it happened on at least five occasions and the IFPA was involved on at least four of those.  Contrary to the implicit suggestion that the counsellor was an inexperienced person who was led into giving this advice, in the case of one Dundalk-based counsellor it was a very experienced person.  Does the IFPA deny that what was recorded took place?  Why has it never issued a statement acknowledging wrong practices within the agency or, indeed, proposing to make amends?  Was that not very reckless?<\/p><p>On page 4 of its presentation, the IFPA clearly criticises the importation of abortion pills as dangerous and describes this as &quot;an unregulated and unsafe practice&quot;.  On the occasion of the investigation to which I have refer, women were told at two IFPA clinics how to purchase and import illegal abortion pills by visiting a named website.  One counsellor advised a woman that she could have such pills posted to a post office box in Northern Ireland.  A counsellor at the Cork IFPA service who discussed the illegal importation of the abortion pill with a woman emphasised that the IFPA was not encouraging her to break the law or get into trouble while pointing out that this could be done.  The counsellor got the woman to write down the relevant information because he or she did not want to be arrested for providing it.  The counsellor was aware that this was not the kind of information he or she should be providing.  Is that not also the action of a rogue agency?<\/p><p>I will summarise my questions.  Does the IFPA acknowledge that there is evidence that some of its people have engaged in actions that were fatal for unborn children and had potentially dangerous consequences for women?  While this evidence was reported to the Garda and led to some commentary in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and at the Oireachtas health committee, the IFPA neither deigned to issue an explanation of past wrongdoing nor showed any desire to investigate or to get to best practice.  Does that not show how little the IFPA actually cares for women's health?  The report or investigation I have mentioned also found that Marie Stopes was criticised by IFPA counsellors, who advised people not to go to Marie Stopes services because they had received many complaints about them.  If the IFPA really cared about women's health, would it not have gone public about this matter rather than quietly advising people not to go to Marie Stopes?  Would this not have been seen as a public health and safety question?  I would be very grateful for answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04700","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Both Mr. Behan and Dr. Henchion may wish to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked and many statements have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>If a little bit of extra time is required, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G05000","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Many of the statements that have been made are absolutely incorrect.

The audit examined the evidence that we relied on for those protocols from a whole range of best practice models; the World Health Organization; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the International Planned Parenthood Federation; the Irish College of General Practitioners; the HSE itself; and the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.

The IFPA had no difficulty in co-operating with that process.  It took up quite a lot of IFPA and HSE staff time.  Following that process, four administrative recommendations were made to us.  We had no difficulty in complying with them.  Within days of receiving those recommendations, we changed our protocols in a manner that was satisfactory to the quality and patient safety directorate.  This is the type of stuff that the IFPA has been putting up with since the 1970s.  It does not deter us.  I do not know why Senator Mullen does it.  It does not really get him anywhere.

A view is sometimes put forward that there is a frivolous aspect to women who might be seeking abortion or that it is a form of family planning.  I am playing devil's advocate in this.

It is not only women, however.  Quite often families are involved in the decision, women and their partners, and they take into account issues relating to their children.  I have spoken to women who, very regretfully, decided to have an abortion because they already had two children with special needs and simply would not have been able to look after them properly if they continued with another pregnancy.  I have come across women who have made their decisions with great difficulty, but after giving them a great amount of thought.  They may feel, for example, that there is a very high risk of a problem occurring with their pregnancies by virtue of their age.  In every case, the women have considered the decision.  They have argued for and against it in their heads for quite a long time before making it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that so many of these women are not using contraception properly or not using reliable contraception at the time they become pregnant.  Quite separately from women who have had a crisis pregnancy or an abortion, I meet many women for emergency contraception or contraception consultations.  Sometimes I meet women for consultations that are totally unrelated to contraception and when I ask them what contraception they are using, they tell me that they are not using any even though they are of reproductive age.  The issue of why women are not using contraception or not using effective contraception is a huge issue which needs to be addressed.  I have given some of the possible reasons for that.  <\/p> <p>  This is not just to do with teenagers and young women.  This is to do with women of all ages having misconceptions about their fertility or simply taking chances, putting off issues of contraception and not doing anything about it.  We really need to address that.

The first is that the medication may not be what it is supposed to be.  That is particularly the case if ordered from a provider that is not reliable.  I have seen women who have taken medication they ordered online themselves and nothing has happened.  The did not have bleeding or pain or they had had very little bleeding.  It is clear that whatever they were given did not contain any active ingredients.  We have no idea of the conditions in which that sort of medication is being made.  It may not be safe.  It may contain ingredients which are not safe for people to take.  It is certainly misleading and it gives women the impression, particularly if they have a small amount of bleeding afterwards, that they may have ended their pregnancy when in fact they have not.  In the event of someone being at a later stage of gestation than she thought, there is a greater chance of the medication not working and, therefore, a greater chance that the pregnancy will continue.  It is dangerous to expose a pregnancy to some of those medications if it then continues.<\/p> <p>  There is not a huge number of complications in these cases, but there is one very simple thing about which I would be concerned when women are accessing pills online.  If anybody who has a miscarriage, abortion or full-term delivery is rhesus negative, which is a blood type, she needs to get anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent damage to any subsequent pregnancies.  These women are clearly not getting that because they are not seeing a health care provider.  My final concern, which I have already mentioned, is the fear that the small number of women who have excessive bleeding are delaying coming to see somebody because they are afraid of getting into trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Following on from that, if the medication is not what it is supposed to be, does it pose the prospect of later travel and an abortion being procured later as a consequence of that delay?

To follow on from some of Deputy Daly's questions on contraception, I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong but I believe they are saying that greater access to contraception leads to fewer unwanted pregnancies.  Can we sum it up like that?  I have tabled a parliamentary question on today's Order Paper, No. 76, which basically asks the Minister for Health the cost to the Exchequer of contraceptives over the past ten years.  I did not table the question just for the good of my health.  I intend to propose that all women in Ireland be provided with free contraception, in the same way as proposed by Deputy Daly, to whom I have spoken about it.  I worked in community pharmacy before and we had difficulty in accessing emergency contraception at the weekend and the Minister introduced a statutory instrument.  Based on what the witnesses have said today and the work which has already been done by members of the committee, it is a no-brainer for us to call for universal access to contraceptives for women in Ireland.<\/p><p>Dr. Henchion referred to long-acting, reversible contraceptives.  The cost of the Mirena coil allowed on the drug payment scheme is &euro;144, providing coverage for five years, give or take, which is &euro;2.40 per calendar month.  That is not a massive sum of money.  Dr. Henchion is talking about the outlay.  I have come across people who have put off having the relevant procedure for financial reasons.<br\/><br\/>We are discussing  socioeconomic reasons today but I want to move away from the economic element to the social one.  One of my sisters had babies in that wonderful hospital in Cork.  I was interested to see that domestic violence goes from one in eight in normal circumstances in Cork, or the regions served by Cork, to one in five when a woman is pregnant.  My understanding is that economic factors have no influence on this.  The committee needs to know that women are much more likely to suffer from domestic violence if they are pregnant.  I should not say that is not only in Cork.  However, the study was conducted in Cork and the surrounding region.  What emerged from it conjures up the idea that women with crisis pregnancies may be trapped in relationships where they are forced to become parents against their will.  Can Dr. Henchion tell me if there is any impediment to a woman's requesting a hysterectomy?  If I decided tomorrow that my periods were too heavy or too difficult and I was low in iron and wrecked all the time, would I have to go to a court to ask that my reproductive organs be removed?  Do I have to clear it with anyone other than my doctor?<br\/><br\/>Referring to something my Fine Gael colleague said, that we do not have any babies to adopt, are we moving into a situation reminiscent of <i>The Handmaid's Tale<\/i>, whereby women with crisis pregnancies will be detained, forced to become parents and used as a source of supply of babies for childless people?  That is up there with the most shocking thing I have heard today and I am hoping to God nobody forces me into that situation.  Good luck to them if they do.<br\/><br\/>I want to correct something that was said by the good Senator Mullen.  <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>did not carry out the investigation into the doctors.

There would be surgical sterilisation operations available to women where the tubes are tied or ligatured.  That is available but logistically it is not very practical because it takes probably over a year for a routine gynaecological appointment to come to the top of the list.  Then, having been seen, the woman may be rejected on the grounds of not enough children, too young or various matters like that.  The woman is then put on a second waiting list - to actually get the procedure done - if that is deemed to be suitable.  There are women who want a permanent method and do not want to have to keep on renewing contraceptive methods.   I would always say that I refer them but they need to do something else now because they will be waiting two to three years for that to become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does anybody intervene, apart from in the context of the conversation between the woman and her doctor to stop her having that procedure?

For a while it felt as if they were on trial.  It is an awful shame to sit on a committee like this, which should be about women and how women are affected, and have the conversation dragged away from that and off in another direction.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to ask have been answered but I would like to tease out some of the socioeconomic reasons.  As a recommendation, there is probably a lack of understanding of what that means.  Initially I recall celebrating this recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.  I received commentary to the effect that it referred to poverty and wanting to abort children born into poverty.  There was a real lack of understanding that this concerns women who are affected in some way by their socioeconomic circumstances and that covers many issues, including mental health, addiction and age.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to sit here every week and separate the political from the personal, particularly as a woman who has probably experienced many of the things we speak about every week.  I was a service user of the IFPA.  I had a crisis pregnancy and I ticked as many boxes as a woman possibly could at the age of 15.  I found the service amazing.  It was comforting and the counselling I received there was very good.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about representing women with crisis pregnancies who proceeded to have children.  I am one of those women and I represent them here.  However, this does not mean that I am of the view that women should not have a choice.  I was given that choice earlier.  This is not a question of the witnesses coming in here to promote abortion, which is how it is being sold.  The IFPA definitely did not sell abortion to me at the age of 15.  I want to put that on the record and to commend the organisation.  As a community worker who works with women in deprivation, I continued to refer women who found themselves in that situation to the IFPA and I would continue to do that, no matter what is said here today.<\/p> <p>  To tease out the socioeconomic circumstances, the witnesses have some of those reasons in the vignettes.  I want to capture today not the barrier to women travelling - because we know that the socioeconomic situation is a factor - but how we begin to create criteria that encompass everything that socioeconomic status can affect.  That exists in other countries.  What falls under it and how?  Is it impossible and should we just go for it without restriction?  If we do not have a ground for socioeconomic reasons should we increase the number of weeks for providing it without restriction because sometimes those socioeconomic factors might not come to light until later?<\/p> <p>  I probably have not been very clear.  It is difficult to separate the personal from the political when I sit in this room.  Perhaps we can speak more to the impact of socioeconomic status on women's decisions.  The witnesses referred to women's aspirations and, for example, a woman wanting to go college and being the first person in her family to do that.  Will people take seriously the fact that women seeking abortion are likely to talk about their own aspirations and what they want in terms of quality of life?  How do we capture that in a doctor's waiting room?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>There is a lot in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I do not think any of it made sense.

If somebody feels that in her particular set of circumstances she cannot continue with the pregnancy, we have to trust her.  In having a consultation with somebody, we have to trust that those appear to be real concerns and that is the decision the person has made.  Obviously, if somebody is not actually certain of what she wants to do, then it is not anybody's role to try to convince her to go in one direction or another.  The role of any consultation, any first contact, will be to identify those women who need more support with their decision and make sure that they get those supports, whether they are financial, practical or more counselling and more time.  That is really where the important thing comes in about identifying socioeconomic problems and making sure that those women get the resources so that socioeconomic factors do not necessarily have to be deciding factors in what they do about their crisis pregnancy.

We see the eighth amendment making no impact on the number of women travelling to the UK.  When we get to 2001 and 2002, however, we see a change, a reduction.  It is an interesting point.  Why have we got this reduction?  Why have we got this doubling of the figures in the 18 years after 1983 and then a reduction in the last 16 years that is almost consistent across all the years?

The service has been around a long time.  I used it in the 1980s during much darker days for women in terms of accessing reproductive health care.  I was afraid to go to my doctor to ask for a coil or the morning after pill and I shared such fear with many women of my generation because we were in those dark times during the 1980s.  If one could not afford a private clinic, the only place one could go was the Irish Family Planning Association and it continues to play that role.  I will never forget the helpless bewilderment on the faces of counsellors when I told them I wanted an abortion.  In those days they could not even give me information on how to go about that because it was before the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 and it was illegal to give me the phone number of an abortion clinic in Liverpool.  I had to get that number under my own steam.  I thank the doctors, counsellors and those who worked tirelessly for women over the past decades and provided those services throughout the country.  In many cases it was not just in respect of contraception but general sexual health.<\/p> <p>  As regards the socioeconomic point and the question of the increasing number of women who are in crisis pregnancies because of poverty, do the witnesses have any evidence that poverty impacts on the level of crisis pregnancy?  The lack of access to proper contraception such as the permanent reversible contraception of which the witness spoke is a contributory factor.  I think it important to repeat something Dr. Henchion said in her submission.  She said: \"I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception\".  Is it not a huge indictment of the services here that we are supposed to be concerned about the protection of life in our laws which say we are concerned about the foetus and the unborn yet socioeconomically we are condemning more women to crisis pregnancies because of the inaffordability of proper contraception?  Can the witnesses confirm if that is the case?<\/p> <p>  An alarming statement made by Dr. Henchion which flies in the face of what was said about Ireland being one of the safest countries in which to be pregnant is that the increased clandestine and illegal use of the abortion pill means more and more women are left without follow-up post-abortion care.  She also said that many of the women she sees do not come back to the IFPA for post-abortion care.  Perhaps she could explain why that is so.  I suspect it is related to the socioeconomic poverty reasons I have mentioned.  Are those who say this is the safest place in the world in which to be pregnant taking into account the IFPA statement which says that a substantial number of women are accessing illegal abortions through the abortion pill and, therefore, do not have follow-up care?  \"It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.\"  That is an extremely strong statement.  I would like the witnesses to expand on how we, as a society, are leaving ourselves and society as a whole but women in particular open to severe consequences through ignoring their reproductive health in this manner or making it illegal for them to take certain actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#M00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>One of the first things one has to do for a health measure to be widely adopted is to get rid of cost.  That is what we do with vaccination programmes.  One could point out that if people valued it enough they would still get it but if one wants everybody to do so, one must get rid of the cost.  That is what is done for public health issues.  If we want to tackle the issue of crisis pregnancy, contraception and sexual health education has to be looked at as a public health issue and money must be taken out of the equation in order that it cannot be a factor.<\/p> <p>  It is not enough to only take out the cost of contraception.  One needs to make people aware of the issues involved or they will not access contraceptive services in the first place.  That definitely links in to socioeconomic factors because, as I said, a girl who leaves school early may have missed out on contraceptive education at school because it might have been delivered too late.  A girl who does not attend school very frequently may not have received that education.  We need to address that issue and ensure we are looking at it as a public health measure.<\/p> <p>  There are many reasons why women do not come for post-abortion care.  It is a difficult question to answer because if they do not attend, I do not see them and, therefore, cannot answer completely for those who do not come.  Some women come to the IFPA and are very anxious about doing so.  They are anxious that they may have a complication or about being judged and the attitudes that people might have towards them and are at pains to try to justify their decision because they think others might feel abortion is only okay for some people.  Those are reasons that people might not want to come.  Because many women do not see a health care provider before they have an abortion, in order to do so afterwards they have to again find out where that service is and then go and tell their story all over again to a new person and that is a difficulty.  If they were going back to the place where they had the abortion, that would not be a deterrent.  Those are some of the reasons women do not attend for care.<\/p> <p>  The risk to a woman's life as a result of an illegal abortion using online medication is exceptionally low but that is not to say that women using such medication have a good health care experience.  There may be minor or low-level risks such as not getting their contraception or enduring a procedure that is painful, uncomfortable and frightening while being alone with absolutely no support and nowhere to which to turn and being worried that if something goes wrong they will be found out rather than get help.

Does she seek his counsel or advice?  Does he have a role in this decision or is he out of the equation?  If the woman in question is exceptionally young, would Dr. Henchion welcome engagement and seek involvement from her parents?<\/p> <p>  I am somewhat concerned about Dr. Henchion's statement that she has seen many women who have had illegal abortions performed.  I am not quite sure what her position is on that.  When a woman comes to Dr. Henchion and says she has had an illegal abortion - I would have the utmost sympathy for the woman - is it not illegal?  If something is illegal, it is illegal.  Does Dr. Henchion think it is incumbent on the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, to share that information or in any way refer it to a statutory body or State agency such as the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#N00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>On the question of whether we seek the involvement of the putative father in the case, the answer is \"No\", we do not.

We are probably only seeing a very tiny percentage of those women who are having illegal abortions, because they are reluctant to come and they will only come if there is a problem.  On the question of whether I would report those women, I do not.  I feel my primary concerns are their confidentiality and health and well-being.

They have an idea about where they want to go if they have made up their mind that they want to have an abortion.  They may have a question.  The other major shift we have seen is that the stigma is reducing, although it is still there and plays a huge part.  The woman coming to us now will probably have told more people now than the woman who came to us 20 years ago about her intention either to have an abortion or if she is coming back for post-abortion care having had an abortion.  We put this down to a breaking down of the stigma.  We see more of our clients now presenting with someone.

My name is Janice Donlon and I am the project manager for funded services with the Health Service Executive, HSE, sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  I am joined today by Helen Deely who is the head of the programme.  We have been asked to address the committee on the supports provided by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme and on the use of the abortion pill.<br\/><br\/>The information will be presented in two sections: first, I will outline supports provided by the programme to those experiencing a crisis pregnancy.  I will then talk about behavioural trends and research relating to crisis pregnancy including use of the abortion pill.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme is a national programme situated within the health and well-being division of the HSE.  The programme is mandated by a statutory instrument to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to provide support to those who have a crisis pregnancy.  Legislation defines crisis pregnancy as &quot;a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her&quot;.  The programme understands this definition to also include the experiences of those women for whom a planned or desired pregnancy develops into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances.<br\/><br\/>A pregnancy may be considered a crisis for several reasons.  Crisis pregnancy can be related to a perceived inability to cope with a child at that time; being too young or too old; not being in a financial position to support a child; and the potential impact that becoming a parent at that point might have on their education, training or employment.  Research finds that approximately one third of women who have been pregnant and one fifth of men who have experienced a pregnancy in their lifetime have experienced a crisis pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>The programme funds 15 individual crisis pregnancy counselling services which operate out of 40 plus locations nationwide to provide free crisis pregnancy counselling.  Details of these crisis pregnancy counselling services can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>.  Crisis pregnancy counselling and information on all three options: parenting, adoption and abortion are provided under the legal framework of Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, also known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Crisis pregnancy counselling services are funded by the HSE under detailed governance arrangements and underpinned by a quality framework including access to supervision and training supports and guidelines and protocols to support services and their staff working in this complex area.<br\/><br\/>Counselling for a woman involves creating space to allow her to discuss and reflect on her crisis pregnancy and to support her through the decision-making process.  While many women experiencing a crisis pregnancy resolve the crisis for themselves, or have support from family and friends, research finds that they see a clear role for a counsellor.  The importance of a supportive listener and non-judgmental support allows them to consider how the pregnancy impacts on their lives.  It is the counsellor's role to provide space and time to facilitate women to work through difficult conflicts in a non-judgmental and non-directive manner.<br\/><br\/>During a counselling session the client may request information on the options available to her.  Any woman considering parenting a child will be made aware of the various organisations and community support groups that offer information and support in relation to parenting, either alone or as a couple.  Many of these organisations are also funded through the programme.  Such organisations and groups have detailed user-friendly booklets touching on many issues of parenting, including information on rights and entitlements and accessing support services.<br\/><br\/>In respect of adoption crisis pregnancy counsellors are able to provide a client with some of the basic principles surrounding the process of adoption and the rights of birth parents and adoptive parents.  However, if a woman chooses adoption as an option she will be appropriately counselled and advised at all stages of the adoption process by an adoption social worker, either with the Tusla adoption service or an accredited body.<br\/><br\/>If, after appropriate counselling on all options, a woman makes the decision to terminate her pregnancy she should be given as much information as is necessary.  Information about abortion services in other countries may be made available under certain conditions.  The law on the subject was passed in 1995 and is usually known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals.  Information on how to access abortion services, including names and addresses of clinics can be provided as can information on the types of procedure that may be available to her.  Crisis pregnancy counsellors are not medically trained and any specific medical questions are referred to the woman's general practitioner.<br\/><br\/>All information should be provided in a manner that is accurate, unbiased, impartial and in accordance with the law.  This is necessary to allow the woman to make an informed decision as to the most appropriate course of action for her.  Information may be given in different formats, including written material which the client can take home with her.<br\/><br\/>The numbers of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services has fallen significantly in recent years.  In 2010 4,662 individual clients attended for crisis pregnancy counselling, by 2016 that number had fallen to 2,570.  The majority of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services are between the ages of 25 and 34.<\/p><p>It is recognised by us and the services that in the 20 years since the commencement of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act,1995 there have been many developments in technology, including access to the Internet.  Many women are now bypassing crisis pregnancy counselling services and accessing information on abortion services directly from the Internet.  While the numbers attending services are decreasing, counselling services report that those attending services are presenting with more complex and multiple issues.  The challenge for the programme and the counselling services is to ensure that women in most need of crisis pregnancy services and supports feel that the services are relevant to them and will meet their needs.<br\/><br\/>Many of the counselling services funded by the programme also support women and their partners through the diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality or life limiting condition.  Additional training and support has been provided to these services to ensure they are able to respond to the needs of this client group.  Counselling services have forged links with maternity units and have the expertise and the capacity to support women and their partners through this difficult time.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the issue of crisis pregnancy agencies, which are not funded by the State.  Some organisations that advertise as crisis pregnancy counselling services have a hidden agenda.  The service they provide is designed to influence the choice a woman makes and to pressure a woman into doing something she may not want to do.  Once these agencies have been contacted by a client they can seek to delay the counselling process and, in certain cases, show clients inappropriate images or use other tactics in an effort to influence their decision.  These organisations are not State funded and women are advised to find out as much information as possible about a pregnancy service before they make an appointment.  All HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme funded services are advertised on <i>positiveoptions.ie<\/i>and will provide non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.<br\/><br\/>Post-abortion services that are available include post-abortion counselling provided by the same funded services which provide crisis pregnancy counselling,.  Details of these post-abortion counselling providers are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Information on the availability of free post-abortion counselling in Ireland is also provided by abortion clinics in the UK and the Netherlands.  The programme links with abortion providers to ensure the information is made available to women who have travelled from Ireland.  Post-abortion psychological support allows a woman a safe space in which to explore and articulate her feelings, whatever they may be, towards the decision made and perhaps the experience of the abortion itself.  A client may require a number of counselling sessions post abortion and the counsellor is available to support the woman depending on her individual needs.  A woman may attend for post-abortion counselling shortly after her abortion or she may attend at a later stage if issues emerge related to other life events.  The number of women who access post-abortion counselling has remained steady over the last number of years and in 2016 a total of 1,377 clients were seen for post-abortion counselling.<br\/><br\/>A post-abortion medical check-up is also available for women to ensure they have fully recovered from their procedure.  A post-abortion check-up normally involves a blood pressure check and an examination of the woman's abdomen.  The doctor will confirm that the pregnancy has ended, check that bleeding pattern is normal and there is no infection and will assist the client with their contraceptive needs.<br\/><br\/>A number of the services funded to provide crisis pregnancy and post-abortion counselling services also provide free post-abortion medical check-ups.  The details of these services are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie<\/i>.  Attendance at the medical checkup also allows an opportunity for the doctor to refer the women to post-abortion counselling if such a referral appears beneficial.  The numbers attending these services is low; in 2016, a total of 442 women attended medical check-ups funded by the programme.  Women may attend their GP on their return if required or, depending on the type of procedure they have undergone, may not require a post-abortion medical check-up, for example with early medical abortion.<br\/><br\/>I shall now address some behavioural trends and the research relating to crisis pregnancy, including use of the abortion pill.  As a core function of its work, the programme monitors behavioural trends relating to its mandates, using a range of tools and indicators including general population surveys and statistics.  Research informs us that crisis pregnancies happen to women and their partners from all different ages, socio-economic backgrounds and with different relationship statuses.  The majority are married, engaged or in steady relationships when the crisis pregnancy occurs.  The most common reasons the pregnancy is seen as a crisis is because it was not planned or the woman and her partner consider themselves too young.  The average age at which a crisis pregnancy occurs is stable at 24 years for women and 25 years for men.<br\/><br\/>When we consider the outcomes of crisis pregnancy we can see that parenting is by far the most common outcome for those who experience a crisis pregnancy.  A survey of the general population found that when asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy 73% of women reported that they chose to parent.  In the same general population survey, 2% of those asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy reported that they chose adoption.  Traditionally in Ireland adoption was a common response for women experiencing a crisis pregnancy; however, the number of women placing their babies for adoption has decreased significantly in recent decades.  A figure of 24% of women in the same general population survey who reported experience of a crisis pregnancy reported that they chose to have an abortion following their most recent crisis pregnancy. <br\/><br\/>With regard to abortions in other jurisdictions it is well documented that many women travel from Ireland to other countries to access legal abortion services.  The programme analyses data collated by the Department of Health in the UK and the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands on the number of women travelling to those countries from Ireland for an abortion on an annual basis.  In the majority of cases, women travelling from Ireland for an abortion travel to England.  In 2016, a total of 3,265 women gave Irish addresses at UK abortion services, representing a rate of 3.2 per 1,000 women.  There has been a gradual decline in the number of women availing of abortion services in the UK since 2001.  In that year there were 6,673 abortions to women from Ireland in UK abortion clinics, representing a rate of 7.5 per 1,000 women.  The Ministry of Health in the Netherlands has collated data on women providing Irish addresses in Dutch abortion clinics since 2010.  Prior to 2010, the programme linked directly with the main abortion service providers in the Netherlands to establish the number of women providing Irish addresses there.  In 2015, 34 women were recorded to have provided Irish addresses in abortion clinics in the Netherlands.  These figures have significantly declined since their peak in 2006 when the number was 461.  The Netherlands has emerged as the only other jurisdiction to which women from Ireland have been travelling for abortion procedures in any significant numbers.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the numbers of abortions in Ireland under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  The Act defines the circumstances within which abortion in Ireland can be legally performed.  The total number of abortions carried out in accordance with this Act in 2016 was 25.  There were 26 in each of the years 2014 and 2015, with 2014 being the first year in which data was reported.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of abortion pills, they are designed to induce an abortion for a woman who is less than nine weeks pregnant.  Abortion pills are used by abortion providers in medically supervised clinics in countries where abortion is legal.  These are referred to as medical abortions.  The programme is aware that some women are accessing abortion pills in Ireland from international online providers.  In order to try to understand the incidence of this, the programme set up a reporting relationship with the Health Products Regulatory Authority in relation to the number of abortion pills seized by customs officers annually.  The programme has provided training and support to all funded services on this emerging issue.  All services have developed protocols in this area and training manuals and online resources have been updated with relevant information.<br\/><br\/>The reasons women may be accessing abortion pills online are cost and access.  For women who have made the decision to terminate a pregnancy, the cost associated with travelling from Ireland to another country for a medically supervised termination is high.  Research finds that higher earning women are more likely to travel to other countries for abortions over their lower earning counterparts.  Until recently it was difficult to make an assessment of the level to which this practice is occurring as limited information was available.  Recently published research suggests that more women are contacting online providers of abortion pills annually and becoming more aware about the availability of these drugs online.  As the committee has been informed by a previous witness Dr. Abigail Aiken, her study found that over the period January 2010 to December 2016 the number of women from Ireland who contacted an online provider of abortion pills tripled.  In 2010 there were 548 online consultations completed by women from the island of Ireland.  In 2016, the number had increased to 1,748.<br\/><br\/>Another research article, published by the same authors in 2017, reports on the experiences of women following taking the abortion pill in Ireland.  The study reports on 1,000 women who underwent self-sourced medical abortion from the online service.  The study reports that while the vast majority of women did not need to contact medical services following taking the abortion pill at home, approximately one in ten - 9.3% - reported to the online provider that they were experiencing a symptom for which they were advised to seek medical advice and the vast majority of these women sought medical advice as advised.<\/p><p>The programme has identified one other main provider of the abortion pill and has sought similar information from this provider for a more accurate assessment of the trend.<br\/><br\/>If a woman takes an abortion pill and has prolonged heavy bleeding, bad pain, fainting or other complications we strongly encourage that she attends an emergency department or GP straight away.  If a woman is concerned about her health following taking an abortion pill, we would encourage her to attend a free post-abortion medical check-up funded by the HSE.  A list of these services is available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie. <\/i><br\/><br\/>I thank the committee members for their attention.

I thank Ms Donlon for coming to the committee today and for her presentation.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the HSE crisis pregnancy website.  It states that it has three mandates, one of which is \"A reduction in the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services and support which make other options more attractive\".  I am a little bit confused because page 2 of Ms Donlon's presentation says that the HSE services are to be provided in a non-directive, non-judgmental and client-centred manner.  If a woman feels that her needs are best met by an abortion what are these other options that the HSE mentions on its website? Is this a case of directive counselling to the woman to continue with the pregnancy or are there other options we are unaware of?  Perhaps Ms Donlon will elaborate on these because it appears to me to be contradictory with regard to the HSE website and what Ms Donlon has said here.  I can see only two options available for women in those circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for the questions.  The mandates certainly set out the exploring of other options.  The way that we interpret the mandates, as set out by the crisis pregnancy legislation, is by providing non-directive and non-judgmental counselling.  That is set out in the law also in respect of providing that level of support for women.  We feel that counselling provides the space and the time for women to explore all of their options in a safe, secure and non-judgmental manner.  We absolutely are not directive in any of our instructions around our mandates and we absolutely support the provision on non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.  Counselling allows women the space and time to discuss all of her options, and to explore how each of the options may impact on her life.  If the woman wants to explore the option of parenting she is given enough support and information to consider that and how it would impact on her individual set of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The programme has provided funding over the years to other organisations to provide supports to those who choose to parent.  A number of the organisations we fund provide support and training to one parent families and additional supports in that area.  Equally, we provide funding to a crisis pregnancy counselling service that has expertise in adoption.  If a woman chooses to explore that option she is given enough information to be able to make that decision.  Our mandates allow us to ensure that women are directed towards counselling that is non-judgmental and non-directive.  This is what we fund in counselling services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donlon for that answer.

Some women do and our services are available to those women.

She cannot believe that she is pregnant and the counsellor's role is to support the woman through that crisis, to support her through the decisions she will make and support her in teasing out how those decisions will impact on her life.

Let me put it this way: we operate within a constitutional framework where the unborn baby is another person to be protected by Irish law, the second human being involved in the equation.  In other areas of our culture, we have very good, proactive and State-funded activity designed to discourage behaviours that might be harmful to individuals themselves or to a third party.  I am thinking about anti-drink and anti-smoking campaigns, drink-driving, and, increasingly, anti-obesity.  These campaigns are publicly funded.  One would not so much describe them as directive and judgmental because they do not judge the people and nor do they require or coerce certain kinds of behaviour, but they do clearly encourage or indeed discourage certain behaviours.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect Ms Donlon to comment on the anomaly, because that would bring her into the realm of policy, but it seems anomalous that, on the one hand, we can encourage certain kinds of behaviours for the sake of protecting an individual, or a third party in the case of drinking and driving and so on, but that when it comes to the protection of the unborn and how that intersects with Ms Donlon's work, it seems to me that the positive options notion sums up her activity, which is to say that as long as the information is procured, supplied and accurately provided when requested, Ms Donlon's job is done.  Is this because the programme sees itself as being curbed by legislation that there is not something more proactive done given our constitutional position, which one would understand ought to tend the State towards protecting the unborn?  I am asking about things like recommending adoption or requiring that State-funded agencies propose or speak positively of adoption as an alternative.<\/p> <p>  I am also talking about things like informed consent.  We had a hearing last week in which it was not effectively accepted but it was certainly not contradicted, that there is no evidence linking abortion with increased mental health outcomes, yet mental health is what is on the Statute Book in Britain and it is what has opened up a large number of abortions.  Mental health was also cited by the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, here earlier.  Does the HSE crisis pregnancy programme require, as a matter of informed consent, that counsellors draw a woman's attention to the possibility that if she had, for example, a previous mental health history she might be at risk of adverse mental health sequelae in the context of abortion?  This is no more and no less than the precise truth.<\/p> <p>  Take the question of ultrasound.  I am not asking Ms Donlon whether it ought to be required that a woman see an ultrasound, but ought it be required of counsellors that they offer that in a respectful way and in a way that always respects a woman's right to refuse, but also in a way that allows the provision and sharing of full information, all of which might act to encourage the life-giving choice at the end of the day?  Does Ms Donlon see that as outside of her mandate?  Would it require a change of law in her view for public policy to go down that road in the light of what the eighth amendment currently states as a matter of public policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#W01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen has spoken for five minutes now.

She is seen in a non-judgmental and non-directive way in relation to the provision of information.  That is how the counselling services operate, and it is good counselling practice to operate in that manner.  The individual is coming to the counsellor in a crisis.

When listening to Ms Donlon's presentation, I reflected on the fact that it has been many years since I marched with my mother on the streets of Dublin for the right to information.  I said to my mother at the time, \"This is ridiculous.  This is only information.\"  Of course, now there is a raft of information available, not only from the HSE.  Ms Donlon states that there has been a gradual decline in the numbers travelling and a gradual increase in the number of women who are accessing abortion pills online.  Presumably, given that the one is going down and the other is going up, we can say that the number of women accessing abortion care is remaining relatively steady, as is the number availing of counselling, 442, which, as Ms Donlon said, is very low.  There is an great deal of information out there, which can be accessed with a few clicks of a mouse.  Women know that the services are available, that the aftercare and emotional support are there, should they require them.  However, the figure for those availing of counselling remains consistently low.  Would it be true to say that this would indicate that women are happy with their choice and have no need for follow-up counselling?  Perhaps Ms Donlon could elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  On the rogue agencies, I am thinking particularly about work done by the journalist Ellen Coyne on those agencies that will tell women that if they have had abortions, they are at greater risk of breast cancer and other nonsense of that nature which we know has no basis in medicine.  Ms Donlon says those agencies target women in crisis pregnancy.  Could she elaborate on how that is done?  I echo what my colleague said - we do not often find ourselves agreeing with Fine Gael but we will say so when it happens.  I welcome the moves by the Minister to regulate these agencies, particularly those which were highlighted in the reports and which are giving that sort of information to women who, in some instances, are frightened.  How is that targeting happening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01000","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I might take that question first.  What we have seen and through our communications unit in the HSE, is that women seek information about abortion services and crisis pregnancies primarily online, through a Google search.  These rogue, disingenuous agencies are targeting women by increasing their spend on paid AdWords on Google.  We in the HSE try to combat that by outbidding them in terms of search words.  It is a constant battle.  We are trying to ensure that our information about the funded services, the Positive Options information, comes up first on Google searches and that these rogue services are not the first result that somebody will see.  I think in the past they may have taken out advertisements in the Golden Pages and the agency and the programme would have tried to combat that by taking out bigger advertisements.  It is a matter of trying to keep up with them at all times.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that they regularly change their names.  While we may have been aware of some of them in the past, they have now changed their name so it is very hard to track.  They change their locations.  It is very difficult to deter women from a certain agency when we do not know where it is actually located.  It is incredibly difficult and the services we fund, which see these women after they have been through traumatic experiences, would certainly let us know that women are traumatised.  They do not want to go through a complaints procedure against these organisations.  We have a complaints mechanism in place if a woman wants to go ahead in that regard.  Often, the woman just wants to get the non-directive, non-judgmental counselling in order to get through her crisis and does not want to revisit a very difficult time.<\/p> <p>  We would absolutely welcome the regulation of counselling services.  The counselling services we fund would also welcome it.  Counselling in general is not regulated.  There is no regulatory body over it.  In the absence of regulation, what the HSE has done in terms of the crisis pregnancy counselling services is to provide training and support for counsellors in a non-regulated environment.  We have robust service arrangements with all of the organisations and put funding into training for individual counsellors.  They have access to supervision as well in terms of their counselling practice.  In order to level the playing field in terms of transparency of crisis pregnancy services, I think regulation certainly will help.<\/p> <p>  What was the Deputy's previous question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>It was to do with the numbers.

We are discussing socioeconomic status and disadvantage in the context of women and the choices they make.  Looking at the Positive Options website and the clinics that provide counselling services - which the HSE funds - I counted 32 or 33 locations but Ms Donlon says it is 40 and I accept that.  I did not look at the geographical spread in respect of them but I want to make a point about access to full information for all women across all centres in Ireland.  Outside of the urban centres, it might be more difficult for women to access a crisis pregnancy counselling service.  Would Ms Donlon comment on that?  It makes it more difficult and therefore the question of socioeconomic and economic disadvantage applies very much more for people who are not near an urban centre where they have choices in the type of counselling received.<\/p><p> My second question is on the list of agencies under Positive Options, approximately one third of which are run by Anew and Cura.  On their websites, both organisations state that they do not provide contact details for abortion clinics or abortion information services, but they will discuss.  It was stated here that the legal framework for providing information on abortion requires that individuals must be given access to the information.  If the only resource available to a poor woman is provided by Anew or Cura, which will not discuss abortion, why are they funded by the crisis pregnancy programme to provide one third of counselling services while failing to give women full access to all of the options they have?  Does it not further disadvantage women who are socially and economically in a bottom bracket?  While Anew or Cura will not provide the information women need on abortion, they will provide the name of a doctor or other service they can attend.  Does it not compound their disadvantage and possibly even the delay in procuring an abortion?  Women need and want to have access to abortion as early as possible but this seems to be an anomaly.  Why does a State agency such as the crisis pregnancy programme fund services which will not provide the full information to women?  They state on their website that they will discuss but not provide the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We fund 15 services providing crisis pregnancy counselling, two of which, the Deputy is right to state, do not provide, due to their ethos, information on names and addresses of abortion clinics outside Ireland.

Also, as the Deputy has seen from their websites, the information is very clearly accessible as to what they will or will not provide.  As such, the client is made aware before she attends whether she will be provided with information on abortion services.  There is an element of choice for some women of attending a service that is not going to provide the information, or choosing another service.  They also have in place, as stated in their service arrangements with the HSE, robust referral procedures so that, if a woman they are counselling seeks information on abortion and wants the names and addresses of clinics, she can be referred to her GP or another service provider.<\/p> <p>  The counselling services certainly report to us that they will support women through the option of abortion.  The ethos of their services does not allow them to provide the names and addresses of the clinics.  Women attend crisis pregnancy counselling for a number of reasons and make decisions on their choices around their crisis pregnancies.  As our research shows, 73% of women choose to parent and many of these organisations support women through that parenting.  Even after the baby is born, they assist them with supports for new mothers.  Certainly, there is a role for the services in that regard.

Many of the questions I had have been answered so I have only two brief questions.  I apologise for interrupting Deputy Fitzpatrick earlier on but I think it is a point that is worth noting.  I probably should have waited my turn.  In respect of adoption and whether it is decreasing or not, when we are having any conversation about women and the choices they have made, we need to look at it in the context of our history, the number of women we locked away and put in mother and baby homes and the number of illegal adoptions that took place in this country.  If the research is not there, I am sure it would factor in along the way if research was ever done.  It is important to say this because I do not think any of us would ever want to advocate that we want to go back to those figures.  It just involves being mindful of those women and the fact that they probably would have chosen to rear their children had they been given the support to do so.  That was the point I was trying to make.<\/p> <p>  In respect of socio-economic matters, I know from throughout my time supporting mothers who already have children, particularly if they are at risk of homelessness or are in addiction, that they are always very cautious of seeking help, particularly from State bodies.  There is some distrust there sometimes.  If somebody is experiencing addiction, how does the counselling operate in this scenarios?  Women are sometimes petrified of being judged as mothers.  They are worried that the children they already have might be taken off them if they raise the reason that a pregnancy is such a crisis.  How do the witnesses deal with that and have they come up against it?  Is there a cohort of women who do not access services because it is a State organisation?  How can we address that?  A point was made that socio-economic inequality exists in respect of being able to travel for abortion with poorer women being more likely to turn to the abortion pill.

The options are more limited for those with lower financial means, those in situations involving domestic violence and those facing a multitude of situations whereby they are unable to make the choices their counterparts with financial means are able to make.  If we take the example of asylum seekers in particular, they are restricted in terms of their economic and social ability and the procedure they must go through should they choose the option of abortion in terms of travelling outside the State for an abortion.  They can be insurmountable to many women in terms of going through with the option they have chosen so there are a range of additional issues that influence a woman's ability to make a decision and follow through with that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Some research has been done on adoption.  The biggest contributor to the fall in adoption rates was when the State introduced payments to women who were initially called unmarried mothers that became payments which allowed people to parent alone so that women did not have to continue with a pregnancy and then give their children up, but had the right to raise their own children and had the economic basis to do so.  The evidence would support that view.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  One of the excellent parts of today's discussion has been the highlighting of the rogue agencies that are out there and the imperative on us as legislators to deal with that.  It relates to the point made by Niall Behan earlier than they are the ones that are not regulated.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how to react to this presentation because I am torn, on the one hand, by trying to get the information out there that despite criminalisation, there are State-provided services for people with crisis pregnancies before and after an abortion which women in Ireland might need tonight.  That is not well known so that is a message we need to get out.  However, on the other hand, is it not an indication of our utter sickening and depressing hypocrisy that we dance around this issue, provide State services, give a constitutional right to access a service in another state, even send the leaflets over and look after women when they come back, but we have no abortion in Ireland?  That is demoralising.  The witnesses are the ones who are implementing that farce.<\/p><p>I do not know if they can comment on it.  I am trying to address the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act and the difficulties it causes.  We have had a lot of testimony about the break in the continuum of care.  Have the HSE's service providers or the agencies it funds highlighted any particular problems?  I am thinking of the comments made by the IFPA, in particular, about deaf women.  Somebody might be given information by a service but how does a deaf person ring a clinic in England and make the appointment?  Is that not a double discriminator?  How would that be addressed?  What are the problems in terms of that legislation?  Other contributors have said contraceptive prevalence is actually the key determinant of lowering abortion rates.  Deputy O'Connell made a point earlier about universal access to contraception.  Is that something the HSE has done research on or costed?  It would be of huge benefit to people.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act.  We acknowledged in the presentation that the Act is outdated given the current technology available to people and the access to information.  That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect the services report to us is that clients are often very surprised that when they attend a counselling service they can be given a list of names and addresses but they cannot be advised on which service might be best for them.  They cannot be referred to a service.  Their GP cannot refer them to a service and they are left alone with their list of services to contact and have to make the arrangements themselves.  The counsellor cannot support them through that element of the decision.  That is more difficult for some women than for others.  It has been highlighted that women with additional needs or financial difficulties are presented with more challenges in making those arrangements and carrying out their decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I can give the committee some statistics on contraception from the ICCP study from 2003 to 2010.  It tells us that even though older age groups are less likely to use contraceptives consistently every time they have sex, there is an increase in contraceptive use across all age groups.  Condom use increased from 57% in 2003 to 62% in 2010.  Use of the pill increased from 39% to 43% in those years.  There was an increase in IUDs from 6% to 11%.  Consistent use of contraception is lower in the older age group.  That has to do with the fact that sometimes women do not believe they are fertile or are ambivalent towards becoming pregnant or would not view an unplanned pregnancy as a crisis.  Increasing access to contraception outside of medical card holders would be a policy decision.  There would need to be information and education campaigns on it in terms of consistent and proper use of contraceptives.  In our programme, we run campaigns to promote consistent use of contraceptives.  We fund the ICGP to claim for long-acting reversible contraceptives, LARC.  We also fund a national condom distribution service that distributes condoms to groups working with those at risk of HIV or STIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Deely"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them.

It was a robust audit on policies, procedures, guidelines and protocols.  It involved in-depth interviews with staff members.  The audit made 11 recommendations, all of which have been fully implemented.  The majority of those recommendations were around improving the policies and procedures that were available in the counselling services.  We and the HSE took the broad view that we were here to support the services in terms of our funding and we supported them through additional training, updating our practice guide, our training manual and by helping them to improve their policies and procedures where there was a lack of available information highlighted by the audit.  We also implemented a quality framework with all services.  All services are signed up to a quality framework that assesses against national standards for crisis pregnancy counselling.

The Bill had been agreed on Committee Stage previously but following the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to consult with stakeholders on the provisions in the Bill and the rationale for the approach to the development of technological universities.  As part of that process a clarification document was subsequently agreed between the Department, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the Technological Higher Education Association.  TUI members voted to accept the agreement in June 2017 and suspended its industrial action in relation to the development of the technological universities.  A clarification document was also provided to IMPACT as part of this process.  The establishment of the technological universities will strengthen the skills, research and innovation capacity in the regions and support economic and social development.<\/p> <p>  Before we discuss the amendments circulated for today I would like to notify the committee that I am also finalising additional amendments which I propose to table on Report Stage.

These regional institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions.

For the main part, they have intimated consortia that they would like to be in.  They are not going alone without any support.  Even yesterday, I announced a budget.  They had a budget last year.  There will be budgets built in to support the formation of the technological universities, TUs, throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I have met many of the institutes of technology, IoTs, and their management.<\/p><p>Of course, there are questions.  This is a whole new merger and project.  Of course, there are many questions to be answered and solutions to be found and ironed out when a merger happens.  Deputy Troy asked specifically about Athlone.  It is clearly Government policy to consolidate institutes of technologies in a technological universities sector.  We will be building scale and capacity to make it attractive for students and staff in the regions where the technological universities are located.  Deputy Troy mentioned to me often when I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as did others, that it is very important to have skills and students in the regions.  That is one of the reasons we are strongly working to ensure students have opportunities to gain a technological university education within their region instead of having to move from the places they reside to a certain city and never going back.  We believe it will really strengthen the sector by creating universities.  We were advised by the OECD in 2004 as well as in the Hunt report about maintaining the binary divide.  We are seeking to ensure that consolidated institutes of technology bring students together and create strong universities.  We would have a critical mass of students and lecturers in an area.  That will be an add-on for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#C02300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Chairman giving me the opportunity to speak as I am not a member.  I have no intention of hogging the committee's meeting this evening.  The Minister of State referenced the Hunt report and another report, both of which were available prior to the negotiations for the programme for Government.  What I read out at the outset was a clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the mandatory need for a merger.  The Minister of State has reiterated in her feedback to me that this is no longer going to be honoured.  That is a straight question.  Is the Government rowing back on the commitment given in the programme for Government?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there is an urgent need to advance this critical legislation.  That the first amendment is to change its date from 2015 to 2017 indicates the length of time this has been ongoing.  I do not want it to get out there that I am trying to say, \"Athlone deserves it\".  It is up to Athlone or any other institute of technology to make its case based on the required areas of research and the level of doctoral or equivalent training among its teaching staff.  If an institute does not meet the high test set down, it will not be able to apply for university status.  If it does meet that, however, it should not be prevented.  I am making the case strongly because this was inserted in the programme for Government with Athlone Institute of Technology in mind.  Given its location, there are no nearby institutes with which it can merge.  The only benefit of a merger for Athlone would simply relate to scale and the number of pupils.  It would have nothing to do with the quality of the education being provided.

It is similar to a trade union in the workplace that would have autonomy from an employer and be given a mandate from members of the union.  My amendment, which is similar to Deputy Martin's amendment, provides a more detailed indication of what is a student union.  Importantly, it stresses the independence of the union from the institution.  Having it as another representative body \"recognised by the institute\" is far too vague and I would have serious concerns about what the representative body would be and if students want it to represent them.  Students give a mandate to a student union and want that body to represent them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#E00500","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 9.

Many institutions are small but absolutely vital in terms of third level educational access for the people who live in the catchment areas.  For instance, Blanchardstown attracts not just, as one might expect, a significant number of students from the north west of Dublin, but also a very significant number of students from Meath, and that has always been the case.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that the campuses will remain and that there will not be another agenda of slimming down the institutions as a consequence of the merger.  This is a legitimate issue for local areas where, particularly if they are trying to attract foreign direct investment, having an institute of technology or being part in the future of a technological university is a really significant and important draw when trying to attract investment to the area.<\/p><p>The reason IBM came to west Dublin in the early 1990s was because people like me were campaigning to have an institute of technology, which did happen.  Although small in terms of access to third-level education in the area, it has been very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#H01000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>The Bill will give that Government support.

Committee members have raised good issues, and perhaps there is something to which we could all agree on Report Stage that could be drafted by the Government.  This is what I suggest.  Deputies Martin and Funchion have raised issues.  It is not a function of a technological university in this section to promote gender equity, for example.  I know there is provision regarding gender equality slightly further on.  As far as I know, it is a function of the DIT legislation that gender equity is promoted.  Perhaps someone can highlight it if I am wrong and I would be delighted to hear it.  It is something that has to be included.<\/p> <p>  There is huge emphasis, and perhaps it is proper emphasis, on business and enterprise and developing an entrepreneurial culture, but there are many courses which do not relate to business and enterprise and a lot of academic disciplines that do not, such as social care, social work and education.  There are many areas.  I am thinking in particular about art and design also.  As far as I know, the institute of art and design would qualify under this legislation to seek to be part of a consortium.  There is art for art's sake, and design for design's sake and they are very important.  They should not necessarily have to be about the needs of business.  There is also culture agus an Gaeilge freisin.  Some of this can be part of a strategic plan, but we need to give more of an emphasis.  The cultural and social development of the State is mentioned, but business and enterprise are emphasised and they seem to be what hits one and what comes out.<\/p> <p>  There is another amendment in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Lawless.  My understanding of his proposal, and he is our science spokesperson, is there such a thing as science discovery for the sake of science discovery.  It might not necessarily be directly relevant to a local employer in Blanchardstown but it could benefit the State hugely.<\/p><p> I have a slight concern with the reference to the community in the region.  I spoke to the officials and they helpfully advised that this wording came from the Parliamentary Counsel.  There seems to be many communities in the regions that these institutions are serving.  That relates to amendment No. 29.  I urge the Government to reconsider that.  The purpose of Committee Stage is for us to go through the Bill line by line but it would be helpful for the Government to at least consider the points we are making and come forward with an amendment on Report Stage which we could hopefully all buy into.  Issues have been raised and the legislation has been lying around, as it were, for quite some time.  There are many functions of a technological university that are not listed or emphasised.

The principle of academic freedom is a defining characteristic of high-quality higher education and research across the world.  The Bill rightly ensures academic freedom will apply in technological universities in the same manner as it applies in universities.  However, it is understood internationally that academic freedom applies to the academic staff of higher education institutions.  Both this and the Universities Act 1997 reflect that understanding.  Extending academic freedom to students would put technological universities in a different position from their peers, both within the State and internationally.  It is believed this would not be appropriate.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the whole doctrine of academic freedom is based on protecting the security of employment of academics&rsquo; tenure.  As students are not employees, their time in a higher education institution is, by definition, limited.  There are appropriate policies in place in institutions to protect students.  There are separate policies and procedures which govern students&rsquo; rights to expression and to offer them protection in this regard.  This includes the right of free expression.  Any claim that this right is being restricted or the fear that voicing a contrarian opinion would invite academic retribution can be better challenged through the existing charters and policies which set out a detailed process for consideration and redress where necessary.  Such policies and processes have already been agreed with student representatives at local level and have been adopted formally by each of the academic councils.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 54 relates to the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff of a technological university.  This is drafted in accordance with similar provisions which apply to universities, institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology under the relevant legislation.  It provides that a technological university may suspend or dismiss a member of staff only in accordance with procedures established, following consultation with the relevant trade unions and staff associations.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of amendments Nos. 151 and 152 is to mirror the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2014 and the Roads Act 2015, which relate to the terms and conditions of service of staff members.  This wording was sought and agreed with the trade unions and stakeholders during the consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#M02000","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's response.

I have raised some of the points relating to this matter previously.  The word \"community\" is in there somewhere as well.  The point is that the plans of the technological university, TU, to provide programmes of education and training should meet the needs of citizens - Deputy Burton made a fair point about that word - business, enterprise and the professions.  I am a member of a profession.  Where do the arts and culture, particularly courses not of a business, enterprise or professional nature, fit in?<\/p> <p>  I will not press my amendment because it includes a flaw but I will speak on it.  In the amendment, I have added in the plans of the TU \"to retain, maintain and develop the existing campuses of its applicant institutes including but not limited to its existing programmes of education, training and research\".  I have not taken account of campuses that may well be closing in the city of Dublin but I want to ensure that there is some protection for Blanchardstown, Tallaght and the regional institutions.  This is my party's main point.<\/p> <p>  In this amendment, I am probably too restrictive in the context of the programmes relating to education, training and research.<\/p><p>I do not want to legislate to retain an exact range of courses as universities should have the academic freedom to provide the courses it wants to provide.  Can the Minister of State assure us that if an institution becomes a TU, a multidisciplinary range of courses will be available?  Can she assure us that institutions such as that in Blanchardstown will not turn into a specialised college for a specialised subject but will be similar to now, with a range of courses provided to meet the needs of the community in the surrounding area?<\/p><p> Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 64, to which I will return on Report Stage, concerns what we want to be included in the strategic plan.  It is proposed that the plans of the TU will ensure the geographic names of its various campuses are maintained in its nomenclature relating to each campus.  This means the Blanchardstown institution will be called the TU for Dublin at Blanchardstown, with the other the TU for Dublin at Tallaght, similar the TUs in Tralee or Cork.
