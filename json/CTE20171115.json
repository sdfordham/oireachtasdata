The Bill is seeking to establish technological universities for the first time in Ireland and that constitutes a step change for the institute of technology sector and will underpin the development of a new type of higher education institution.  The Bill had been agreed on Committee Stage previously but following the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to consult with stakeholders on the provisions in the Bill and the rationale for the approach to the development of technological universities.  As part of that process a clarification document was subsequently agreed between the Department, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the Technological Higher Education Association.  TUI members voted to accept the agreement in June 2017 and suspended its industrial action in relation to the development of the technological universities.  A clarification document was also provided to IMPACT as part of this process.  The establishment of the technological universities will strengthen the skills, research and innovation capacity in the regions and support economic and social development.<\/p> <p>  Before we discuss the amendments circulated for today I would like to notify the committee that I am also finalising additional amendments which I propose to table on Report Stage.  With your permission, Chairperson, and in the interests of ensuring fairness and respect to the committee I will mention them briefly.  I intend on Report Stage, subject to the advice of the Attorney General and Government approval, to bring forward amendments to provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a new power to appoint an investigator to publicly funded higher education institutions.  The provision will also require a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#B00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials to the committee today.

I got slightly nervous when the Minister of State mentioned the Attorney General's advice and the approval of the Government.

We do not want anything to hold that up.<\/p> <p>  Given that the Minister of State is introducing amendments to the Universities Act I will bring forward amendments to allow the Royal College of Surgeons to designate itself as a university within the jurisdiction and not just abroad, as has been the case in recent years.

The work that is done in the colleges, in terms of allowing access to third level education all over Ireland, is an important social asset in this country but it is also important to employers in terms of identifying people who will have, in particular, not only broad educational development but professional development, for example, in engineering, in accounting and in other specific professional fields.  That has always been recognised as a strong merit point with technological universities.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention a couple of issues which I hope the Minister of State will address in the course of the discussion on this.

For the main part, they have intimated consortia that they would like to be in.  They are not going alone without any support.  Even yesterday, I announced a budget.  They had a budget last year.  There will be budgets built in to support the formation of the technological universities, TUs, throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I have met many of the institutes of technology, IoTs, and their management.<\/p><p>Of course, there are questions.  This is a whole new merger and project.  Of course, there are many questions to be answered and solutions to be found and ironed out when a merger happens.  Deputy Troy asked specifically about Athlone.  It is clearly Government policy to consolidate institutes of technologies in a technological universities sector.  We will be building scale and capacity to make it attractive for students and staff in the regions where the technological universities are located.  Deputy Troy mentioned to me often when I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as did others, that it is very important to have skills and students in the regions.  That is one of the reasons we are strongly working to ensure students have opportunities to gain a technological university education within their region instead of having to move from the places they reside to a certain city and never going back.  We believe it will really strengthen the sector by creating universities.  We were advised by the OECD in 2004 as well as in the Hunt report about maintaining the binary divide.  We are seeking to ensure that consolidated institutes of technology bring students together and create strong universities.  We would have a critical mass of students and lecturers in an area.

I have no intention of hogging the committee's meeting this evening.  The Minister of State referenced the Hunt report and another report, both of which were available prior to the negotiations for the programme for Government.  What I read out at the outset was a clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the mandatory need for a merger.  The Minister of State has reiterated in her feedback to me that this is no longer going to be honoured.  That is a straight question.  Is the Government rowing back on the commitment given in the programme for Government?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there is an urgent need to advance this critical legislation.  That the first amendment is to change its date from 2015 to 2017 indicates the length of time this has been ongoing.  I do not want it to get out there that I am trying to say, \"Athlone deserves it\".  It is up to Athlone or any other institute of technology to make its case based on the required areas of research and the level of doctoral or equivalent training among its teaching staff.  If an institute does not meet the high test set down, it will not be able to apply for university status.  If it does meet that, however, it should not be prevented.  I am making the case strongly because this was inserted in the programme for Government with Athlone Institute of Technology in mind.  Given its location, there are no nearby institutes with which it can merge.  The only benefit of a merger for Athlone would simply relate to scale and the number of pupils.  It would have nothing to do with the quality of the education being provided.

I want a provision in the Bill to the effect that Castlebar will remain part of GMIT, or whatever institution that body would eventually become part of, and any other offshoots around the country.  The regional provision and regional location of campuses in the institute of technology, IT, sector is equally critical in the technological university, TU, sector if an IT is to become a TU.  It is an absolute precondition, a <i>sine qua non<\/i>, of Fianna F&aacute;il's support for the Bill that not only the regional identity and regional focus, but also the actual physical location of campuses and the multidisciplinary range of courses provided in those various campuses are retained, while obviously not legislating for the exact courses provided in universities.  A little more work needs to go into this, and I think there needs to be a definition of &quot;campus&quot; that acknowledges that some in Dublin are to move to Grangegorman but that others very badly need to be protected and maintained in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#H00500","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Going back to the earlier discussion, I would be grateful if the Minister of State clarified the following.  If, for instance, an institution in some part of the country is on its own and does not have an obvious partner, or has a partner indicated by the Department but does not want to join with that particular partner, will the Minister of State confirm that the institution is free to put forward a proposal to join with an institution, for instance, in Dublin or Cork, even though they may not be in the one region, if it is the desire of those institutions to so merge?  For the sake of example, suppose Dundalk, Athlone or Carlow wanted to join the Dublin technological university.  I know it is a bit of an extreme example, but the Minister of State laid a lot of emphasis on the fact that there must be two or more institutions.  Can those institutions be selected nationally?  I was a little taken aback that in her reference to Athlone IT, which is a significant institution with particular specialisations, the Minister of State implied in her previous statement, as I understood it, that its numbers were not sufficient to merit an application as one of the two or more institutions.  The same may well apply to Carlow IT if, for instance, it were not able to address the ongoing discussions between it and Waterford IT.

For the record, in case anyone thinks otherwise, I have the highest regard for Athlone IT.  I have visited it not only as the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, but also in my last role.  In any of the messages I got from industries and businesses that opened in and around Athlone, Roscommon or Mullingar in particular, I heard the highest of praise for Athlone Institute of Technology, so I am a huge fan of AIT.  I did not put the critical mass numbers on the record.  TU4Dublin will be 27,880 students; Munster TU, approximately 13,495: the Connacht-Ulster technological university alliance, 15,910; and TU south east, 14,612.  We believe having a critical mass is really important.  According to the figures for Athlone IT that I have before me, there was a student cohort of 4,890 in 2015-16, while Dundalk's was 4,999.  Our plan is to put the colleges and ITs together and create a critical mass and a choice for students in order that they can go from level 6 right up to doctorate level if they so wish.

Deputy Byrne asked the Minister of State earlier - and I would like it confirmed - whether the Government is actually committing to the retention of all the institutes of technology and the campuses in the diverse locations in which they exist around the country.  For instance, in Blanchardstown, and similarly in Tallaght, the student population is relatively small compared to the mass of DIT.  Many institutions are small but absolutely vital in terms of third level educational access for the people who live in the catchment areas.  For instance, Blanchardstown attracts not just, as one might expect, a significant number of students from the north west of Dublin, but also a very significant number of students from Meath, and that has always been the case.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that the campuses will remain and that there will not be another agenda of slimming down the institutions as a consequence of the merger.  This is a legitimate issue for local areas where, particularly if they are trying to attract foreign direct investment, having an institute of technology or being part in the future of a technological university is a really significant and important draw when trying to attract investment to the area.<\/p><p>The reason IBM came to west Dublin in the early 1990s was because people like me were campaigning to have an institute of technology, which did happen.

I know there is provision regarding gender equality slightly further on.  As far as I know, it is a function of the DIT legislation that gender equity is promoted.  Perhaps someone can highlight it if I am wrong and I would be delighted to hear it.  It is something that has to be included.<\/p> <p>  There is huge emphasis, and perhaps it is proper emphasis, on business and enterprise and developing an entrepreneurial culture, but there are many courses which do not relate to business and enterprise and a lot of academic disciplines that do not, such as social care, social work and education.  There are many areas.  I am thinking in particular about art and design also.  As far as I know, the institute of art and design would qualify under this legislation to seek to be part of a consortium.  There is art for art's sake, and design for design's sake and they are very important.  They should not necessarily have to be about the needs of business.  There is also culture agus an Gaeilge freisin.  Some of this can be part of a strategic plan, but we need to give more of an emphasis.

The principle of academic freedom is a defining characteristic of high-quality higher education and research across the world.  The Bill rightly ensures academic freedom will apply in technological universities in the same manner as it applies in universities.  However, it is understood internationally that academic freedom applies to the academic staff of higher education institutions.  Both this and the Universities Act 1997 reflect that understanding.  Extending academic freedom to students would put technological universities in a different position from their peers, both within the State and internationally.  It is believed this would not be appropriate.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the whole doctrine of academic freedom is based on protecting the security of employment of academics&rsquo; tenure.  As students are not employees, their time in a higher education institution is, by definition, limited.  There are appropriate policies in place in institutions to protect students.  There are separate policies and procedures which govern students&rsquo; rights to expression and to offer them protection in this regard.  This includes the right of free expression.  Any claim that this right is being restricted or the fear that voicing a contrarian opinion would invite academic retribution can be better challenged through the existing charters and policies which set out a detailed process for consideration and redress where necessary.  Such policies and processes have already been agreed with student representatives at local level and have been adopted formally by each of the academic councils.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 54 relates to the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff of a technological university.  This is drafted in accordance with similar provisions which apply to universities, institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology under the relevant legislation.  It provides that a technological university may suspend or dismiss a member of staff only in accordance with procedures established, following consultation with the relevant trade unions and staff associations.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of amendments Nos. 151 and 152 is to mirror the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2014 and the Roads Act 2015, which relate to the terms and conditions of service of staff members.  This wording was sought and agreed with the trade unions and stakeholders during the consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#M02000","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's response.

I have raised some of the points relating to this matter previously.  The word \"community\" is in there somewhere as well.  The point is that the plans of the technological university, TU, to provide programmes of education and training should meet the needs of citizens - Deputy Burton made a fair point about that word - business, enterprise and the professions.  I am a member of a profession.  Where do the arts and culture, particularly courses not of a business, enterprise or professional nature, fit in?<\/p> <p>  I will not press my amendment because it includes a flaw but I will speak on it.  In the amendment, I have added in the plans of the TU \"to retain, maintain and develop the existing campuses of its applicant institutes including but not limited to its existing programmes of education, training and research\".  I have not taken account of campuses that may well be closing in the city of Dublin but I want to ensure that there is some protection for Blanchardstown, Tallaght and the regional institutions.  This is my party's main point.<\/p> <p>  In this amendment, I am probably too restrictive in the context of the programmes relating to education, training and research.<\/p><p>I do not want to legislate to retain an exact range of courses as universities should have the academic freedom to provide the courses it wants to provide.  Can the Minister of State assure us that if an institution becomes a TU, a multidisciplinary range of courses will be available?  Can she assure us that institutions such as that in Blanchardstown will not turn into a specialised college for a specialised subject but will be similar to now, with a range of courses provided to meet the needs of the community in the surrounding area?<\/p><p> Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 64, to which I will return on Report Stage, concerns what we want to be included in the strategic plan.  It is proposed that the plans of the TU will ensure the geographic names of its various campuses are maintained in its nomenclature relating to each campus.  This means the Blanchardstown institution will be called the TU for Dublin at Blanchardstown, with the other the TU for Dublin at Tallaght, similar the TUs in Tralee or Cork.  This is the case for the various campuses of the University of Ulster.  Deputy Lahart raised the issue in respect of Tallaght and pointed out that some people want it to be called TU Tallaght.  That is not going to happen because it is going to be part of one body.  The name \"Tallaght\" should be retained somewhere, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#T02200","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>TU4Dublin is committed to fully-serviced campuses.
