I am registered with the Irish College of General Practitioners as a contraceptive tutor and a tutor in the provision of long-acting reversible contraception.  I am a member of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health and the Irish Association of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Providers.<\/p> <p>  I have been the medical director of the Irish Family Planning Association since 2008.  The IFPA is Ireland's leading sexual health charity.  It promotes the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health information and dedicated, confidential and affordable health care.  We operate two not-for-profit medical clinics where we deliver services, including contraception, post-abortion medical check-ups, cervical screenings, and screenings for sexually transmitted infections.  We also have ten centres nationwide where we provide free pregnancy counselling and post-abortion counselling services. <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I work in the context of an extremely restrictive legal framework, principally, the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  We are also bound by two pieces of legislation that include criminal sanctions, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and the Abortion Information Act.  Navigating these complex legal barriers while trying to maintain a caring clinical relationship is an immense challenge for us as health care providers.<\/p> <p>  This presentation will address the socio-economic dimensions of crisis pregnancy, and the impacts of current Irish law on women who experience an unintended pregnancy or a pregnancy that has become a crisis for other reasons.  I have included case vignettes in appendix one to this submission to further illustrate women's decision-making.  I am happy to expand on issues raised in these afterwards.   <\/p> <p>  An unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence among women of reproductive age.  While for some women this is a joyful and welcome situation, for many it is a traumatic and devastating life event.  Conversely, a wanted or planned pregnancy can become a crisis.  An unintended pregnancy can mean the difference between a woman determining her own future or seeing her plans derailed and her aspirations frustrated. <\/p> <p>  In 2016, more than 3,000 women and girls gave Irish addresses at UK abortion clinics.  These women were from all walks of life and from every county in Ireland.  In addition, as Dr. Abigail Aiken explained in an earlier session, women are increasingly accessing the abortion pill online.<\/p> <p>  Clients of IFPA doctors and pregnancy counsellors include women who have made a decision to have an abortion for a wide range of reasons related to their physical and mental health and well-being, and their ability to cope with a pregnancy.  The majority of our clients who consider abortion do so because to continue an unintended pregnancy would be an intolerable burden at this time in their life.  Any meaningful change from the current legal situation must include these women.<\/p> <p>  Each woman weighs up her particular circumstances very carefully before deciding that she is unable to cope with a pregnancy.  The factors a woman considers include the following: her family situation; her income; her social support networks; her plans for education; her working conditions; and her social and physical environments in terms of housing, relationships and so on.  Many women in this situation already have children.  They know what it means to be a mother.  For them, the need to care for their children is the primary reason that they decide not to continue with another pregnancy.  A woman may be trapped in an abusive relationship, or fear that continuing the pregnancy will trap her and her children into a lifelong relationship with an abuser. <\/p> <p>  Pregnancy counselling services, such as the IFPA, can support women through their decision-making and give them information about abortion services.  Increasingly, our clients are women who experience multiple forms of disadvantage which, in turn, restrict access to abortion.  Indeed, the term \"socio-economic\" masks the reality that an unintended pregnancy can have devastating impacts on a woman's life and that of her family. <\/p> <p>  Once a woman in Ireland has made the decision to have an abortion, she is faced with a range of further obstacles and difficulties.  Cost will be a significant factor in the decision of almost every woman.  She will need to consider the practical supports available to her and ask herself the following questions.  Can she organise child care?  Can she get a sick certificate from her doctor?  Can her partner get time off to accompany her?  As a migrant woman, is she legally able to leave the country?  Will she be able to navigate the immigration procedures?  If she has a disability, how will this impact on her ability to access care?  Not everyone lives in Dublin or Cork.  Women who live at a distance from the major cities, particularly if they are dependent on public transport, may have a very lengthy journey to an airport if they decide to travel to the UK for a safe and legal abortion.  Clearly, this constitutes a further significant barrier.  For minors, all of these matters are immensely more complicated. <\/p> <p>  Non-judgmental, non-directive counselling by a trained professional can be a huge support to a woman at this time, but it is no substitute for access to services.  We cannot ignore the fact that socio-economic factors frequently determine whether a woman travels for a legal abortion or resigns herself to the reality that her only option is an illegal abortion.  For some women, the obstacles are insurmountable and they are forced to continue the pregnancy against their wishes. <\/p> <p>  When abortion is criminalised, as it is in Ireland, the burden of accessing care falls on the woman rather than the health care system.  This is because, whether a woman travels abroad for legal services or has an illegal abortion in Ireland, she must leave the mainstream health care service.  Her experience will not meet international health care standards such as those of the World Health Organization and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. <\/p> <p>  If a woman decides to travel for abortion, the information Act prohibits her doctor from making a referral to services in another State, even if she does not speak English, has a poor educational level or has an underlying medical condition.  Unlike any other medical treatment situation, the continuum of care is broken.  The onus shifts to the patient to make contact with a doctor outside of Ireland and to provide her medical history.  She must make her way to a private medical facility in another country without the supports that apply in other situations where people travel for health care.<\/p> <p>  A woman who is unable to travel, or for other reasons opts for an illegal abortion, is faced with the challenge of trying to find a reliable online provider without medical assistance.  She also risks prosecution under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act if she self-induces abortion, as does anyone who assists her.  In either scenario, an underlying medical condition that is easily managed in the context of legal abortion may become more risky.<\/p> <p>  Yet another way in which care falls below acceptable standards is a lack of contraceptive provision.  As Professor Arulkumaran told this committee, best practice in the context of where abortion is legal is that contraception is offered as part of integrated abortion care at the initial presentation and the post-abortion consultation.  For women in Ireland, this is not the case.  This may be because her first presentation is not with a doctor, and so she does not have immediate access to contraceptive information.  Online abortion pill providers are not in a position to provide ongoing contraception.  I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception, which are the most effective.  <\/p> <p>  All of these failures of care are related to the disruption and fragmentation of care in the context of restrictive criminal abortion laws.  We see this also in relation to post-abortion care.  Women who can access abortion in their own country have a clear post-abortion care pathway with the same provider.  In the event of complications, there are robust and timely pathways for referral, as recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG.  This is not the case for women who travel from Ireland.  While free post-abortion care is funded by the HSE, and available to women from providers such as the IFPA, our experience is that only a small number of women avail of it.<\/p><p>Women who access illegal abortions receive a still lower standard of care.  In addition to the fragmented care pathway, they risk inadvertently accessing medication from an unreliable online source which could be inactive, inadequate or potentially harmful.  In my clinical experience, women accessing medication online tend to report problems late.  Fear of prosecution is a real deterrent to accessing health care for some of these women.<\/p><p> A substantial number of women are accessing abortion in this way.  As Dr. Aiken made clear, most women experience relief at the availability of this option, but that is not to say that it is acceptable health care.  It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.<\/p><p> In considering the real health concerns associated with the criminalisation of abortion, we must not forget the impact of stigma on women.  Research by the American Psychological Association has found that feelings of stigma, perceived need for secrecy, exposure to anti-abortion picketing and low perceived or anticipated social support for the abortion decision negatively impact women&rsquo;s post-abortion psychological experiences.  Every day, IFPA counsellors hear from women about these experiences.  Women&rsquo;s privacy and informed consent are invaded in ways that do not happen when services are locally available.  Some women must make multiple disclosures of a private and personal health situation to, for example, community welfare officers, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, staff in direct provision centres and social workers.  Decisions made at this level can turn obstacles into barriers.  Women&rsquo;s dignity is violated at every step.  Their right to confidentiality is taken from them so many times, right up to the moment when they find themselves in taxis from airports to abortion clinics with women they do not know. <\/p><p> In conclusion, our legal system imposes a significant burden on women at a time of crisis and stress in their lives.  It criminalises women and health care providers.  All women are disadvantaged and discriminated against when they are forced to travel to another state to access abortion services, and even more so if they access illegal abortion.  The requirement to travel for abortion forces a reduced quality of care on women.  Again, this is even more the case with illegal abortion.  We have an urgent need for safe and legal abortion care in this country.  This means equitable access, regardless of socio-economic status, to high quality, affordable, local services in Ireland that respect women&rsquo;s autonomy and decision making.  As a society, we must take responsibility for ensuring that this becomes a reality in law and in health care practice.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I am happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The usual issue that arises is that the woman will have been delayed.  There will have been several appointments and she will have been delayed in seeking care.  Obviously, we do not know if some women are deterred completely because if that is the case, we will not see them.  However, the counsellors see women who have had negative experiences in such agencies.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the socio-economic effects on mental health, particularly in respect of pregnancy, socio-economic factors and mental health are very much intertwined in every aspect of life.  Sometimes the socio-economic burden of an unintended pregnancy can have a negative effect on somebody's mental health.  It becomes very difficult to separate those issues because in most such cases, many different issues are present.  Obviously, if somebody is concerned about, perhaps, an abusive partner, this becomes much more likely and it is more likely that her mental health will suffer if she is in a pregnancy she feels she cannot manage.  The two issues are very much intertwined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>With regard to some of the examples the witness provided to the committee in the appendix, she spoke about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and some of the difficulties that has presented.

If somebody presents and one feels there is a possibility she might qualify for an abortion under the Act, one cannot have any certainty about that.  One can only say to her that there is a possibility that she might be considered for an abortion under the Act.  One can explain the procedures, which are that she will have to be seen first by an obstetrician and then either by another obstetrician or another physician or two psychiatrists for a decision to be reached.  If somebody is suffering from mental ill health, for example, it is quite likely she will be attending a psychiatrist already.  She might have already disclosed that and she has now disclosed her situation to a counsellor or a doctor.  The prospect of having to go through three more similar investigations with another medical person is off-putting for her.  Our experience, and it is not huge because not many women will qualify under the Act anyway, is that where these issues arise, the woman will choose to travel if she has the means.  She does not want to have the uncertainty and the rigour of having to go through the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will save the remainder of the Deputy's time for the next session.

The presentation was absolutely excellent.  I was struck by Dr. Henchion's comment that unintended pregnancy is a frequent occurrence.  This committee has spent a great deal of time considering circumstances of rape, fatal foetal abnormality and the woman's health.  In the experience of the IFPA, the majority of women who decide to access abortion would not fit into those categories.  Perhaps she will expand on that and, by implication, what that means for this committee.

The vast majority of them are far more complex and involve many socio-economic factors.  As to what those factors are, there are as many different sets of circumstances as there are women.  Various combinations of factors occur.  It might be a young woman who is still in education or very early on a career path who does not have the support of a partner and who feels she will damage her future by continuing with the pregnancy.  It might be an older woman who has children and has just got back into the workplace.  As in the first vignette I gave, there might be financial difficulties for that family that they are trying to get through and they feel another pregnancy would stop them being able to get their lives back on track.<\/p><p>We have some women with very severe forms of disadvantage.  For example, some women are battling addiction and might have children in care.  They are on a pathway out of addiction and have accessed services.  They have succeeded in keeping sober.  They just feel that the mental health toll of a pregnancy and the fact of having another baby might put their goal of getting their plans back on track out of their reach.  There are a vast number of different situations that occur.  Trying to set out a list of conditions that would fulfil a socio-economic criteria  is unrealistic.  The only way to deal with that is to have some sort of open access so that these conditions can be met.  Whether the committee decides to put gestational limits in place for that is a matter for the Government.  To ask women to meet certain criteria does not recognise the complexity of the issue in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Two things are apparent to me but I do not want to put words in the mouth of Dr. Henchion.

When I am at work in my clinic I provide contraception for a good part of my day, which is fine.  I can only see the people who make it in to see me.  That means the women must know that a contraceptive service is available, be able to afford contraception services and know where to access them.  First, one needs good quality education and awareness programmes so that women are aware of contraceptive methods and where to access them.<\/p> <p>  Second, one must remove the financial barrier.  Without question there is a financial barrier.  A person with a medical card can access services for free.  However, a person on the cusp of not having a medical card who is not well off cannot access services.  I have seen what happens when women seek long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, such as the Mirena coil or whatever.  They are really interested and want it because they want to be very safe.  Quite often, when I outline the cost to them they defer their decision.  Unfortunately, some of those women end up using much less safe methods.

To be perfectly honest, I cannot see why anybody inserted a 14-year prison sentence unless one wanted it to have a chilling effect.  That seems obvious.  As a group, doctors are very anxious about anything that would damage their reputation in any way.  Being associated with potential criminal charges, even if one is not sent to prison, is a huge threat and definitely influences people in the way they manage consultations.  It means that instead of a doctor being comfortable and free in his or her discussion with somebody one is continually, in one's mind, trying to be guarded and careful about anything one might say that could possibly be interpreted as not being in keeping with the law.  Decriminalisation would take away that layer yet one still can have lots of ethical and clinical guidelines.  The Medical Council is still in a position to sanction doctors who have been found to have behaved inappropriately.  It should not mean that people think doctors will somehow behave badly if there is no criminal sanction.

As the Deputy said, this has been investigated by the HSE and a file was sent to the DPP and there has been no evidence of wrongdoing found.  I do not know that one can say we did anything wrong in this situation.

I spoke last week about Marie Stopes paying bonuses to staff members to encourage people to have abortions.  That is totally wrong.<\/p> <p>   The witness has talked about how a woman who travelled abroad for an abortion will not be able to bring her medical history with her.  Medical history is very important so that a doctor can treat a woman properly.  If she has any complications or problems, he knows exactly what he can do because he has the records.  If women who went to Irish Family Planning Association clinics followed the advice they got there and told doctors they had a miscarriage instead of an abortion it would mean giving false medical history and if any complications cropped up, doctors would not be able to treat them properly because they would not be aware they had had an abortion.  Given that medical history is very important, why were counsellors in Irish Family Planning Association clinics telling women they could give false information to their doctors.  How can the organisation tell us women's health is very important?  I am very disappointed.  People do not just make these things up.  People went in looking for advice from the services.

I think the Chair said she is \"indebted to Deputy Rabbitte\" for her comments about the non-appearance before the committee of certain pro-life invitees.  To judge by the letters sent in by two of them, they did not want to be used in a tokenistic way by a committee that had already made up its mind that the eighth amendment must be changed or removed.  That was a significant decision to take without hearing all the evidence.  The response of the invitees in question was very understandable.

In light of that, I want to go back to some of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  An expos&eacute; that was reported on in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>a few years ago was done by a group of women who had anecdotal or personal experience of having abortions or who knew women who subsequently came to regret their decisions and felt they had been badly and, in some ways, illegally advised by counselling agencies in receipt of funding from the State.  This is a very serious matter.  It was investigated by the Garda.  The evidence showed that women were told to hide their abortions from their own doctors on five occasions.  In four of those five cases, it was IFPA counsellors who told them to do so.  In one case, a woman was told that if complications arose after a surgical abortion in Britain, she needed to tell medical staff in hospitals that she had had a miscarriage.  Nothing was said to her about whether she would be criminalised.  There was no evidence that this would ever happen.  I think the strong understanding of people is that it would never happen.  She was simply told she needed to tell medical staff she had had a miscarriage, as opposed to an abortion.<\/p><p>The then Master of the Rotunda Hospital, Professor Sam Coulter-Smith, criticised the danger surrounding this type of advice.  He said that complications during an abortion procedure could result in perforation of the uterus, which could be life-threatening if not known to the woman's doctor.  I put it to the IFPA that this was the action of a rogue agency.  It did not just happen once; it happened on at least five occasions and the IFPA was involved on at least four of those.  Contrary to the implicit suggestion that the counsellor was an inexperienced person who was led into giving this advice, in the case of one Dundalk-based counsellor it was a very experienced person.  Does the IFPA deny that what was recorded took place?  Why has it never issued a statement acknowledging wrong practices within the agency or, indeed, proposing to make amends?  Was that not very reckless?<\/p><p>On page 4 of its presentation, the IFPA clearly criticises the importation of abortion pills as dangerous and describes this as &quot;an unregulated and unsafe practice&quot;.  On the occasion of the investigation to which I have refer, women were told at two IFPA clinics how to purchase and import illegal abortion pills by visiting a named website.  One counsellor advised a woman that she could have such pills posted to a post office box in Northern Ireland.  A counsellor at the Cork IFPA service who discussed the illegal importation of the abortion pill with a woman emphasised that the IFPA was not encouraging her to break the law or get into trouble while pointing out that this could be done.  The counsellor got the woman to write down the relevant information because he or she did not want to be arrested for providing it.  The counsellor was aware that this was not the kind of information he or she should be providing.  Is that not also the action of a rogue agency?<\/p><p>I will summarise my questions.  Does the IFPA acknowledge that there is evidence that some of its people have engaged in actions that were fatal for unborn children and had potentially dangerous consequences for women?  While this evidence was reported to the Garda and led to some commentary in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and at the Oireachtas health committee, the IFPA neither deigned to issue an explanation of past wrongdoing nor showed any desire to investigate or to get to best practice.  Does that not show how little the IFPA actually cares for women's health?  The report or investigation I have mentioned also found that Marie Stopes was criticised by IFPA counsellors, who advised people not to go to Marie Stopes services because they had received many complaints about them.  If the IFPA really cared about women's health, would it not have gone public about this matter rather than quietly advising people not to go to Marie Stopes?  Would this not have been seen as a public health and safety question?  I would be very grateful for answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04700","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Both Mr. Behan and Dr. Henchion may wish to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked and many statements have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G04900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>If a little bit of extra time is required, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#G05000","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Many of the statements that have been made are absolutely incorrect.

The audit examined the evidence that we relied on for those protocols from a whole range of best practice models; the World Health Organization; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the International Planned Parenthood Federation; the Irish College of General Practitioners; the HSE itself; and the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.

The IFPA had no difficulty in co-operating with that process.  It took up quite a lot of IFPA and HSE staff time.  Following that process, four administrative recommendations were made to us.  We had no difficulty in complying with them.  Within days of receiving those recommendations, we changed our protocols in a manner that was satisfactory to the quality and patient safety directorate.  This is the type of stuff that the IFPA has been putting up with since the 1970s.  It does not deter us.  I do not know why Senator Mullen does it.  It does not really get him anywhere.

A view is sometimes put forward that there is a frivolous aspect to women who might be seeking abortion or that it is a form of family planning.  I am playing devil's advocate in this.

It is not only women, however.  Quite often families are involved in the decision, women and their partners, and they take into account issues relating to their children.  I have spoken to women who, very regretfully, decided to have an abortion because they already had two children with special needs and simply would not have been able to look after them properly if they continued with another pregnancy.  I have come across women who have made their decisions with great difficulty, but after giving them a great amount of thought.  They may feel, for example, that there is a very high risk of a problem occurring with their pregnancies by virtue of their age.  In every case, the women have considered the decision.  They have argued for and against it in their heads for quite a long time before making it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that so many of these women are not using contraception properly or not using reliable contraception at the time they become pregnant.  Quite separately from women who have had a crisis pregnancy or an abortion, I meet many women for emergency contraception or contraception consultations.  Sometimes I meet women for consultations that are totally unrelated to contraception and when I ask them what contraception they are using, they tell me that they are not using any even though they are of reproductive age.  The issue of why women are not using contraception or not using effective contraception is a huge issue which needs to be addressed.  I have given some of the possible reasons for that.  <\/p> <p>  This is not just to do with teenagers and young women.  This is to do with women of all ages having misconceptions about their fertility or simply taking chances, putting off issues of contraception and not doing anything about it.  We really need to address that.

The first is that the medication may not be what it is supposed to be.  That is particularly the case if ordered from a provider that is not reliable.  I have seen women who have taken medication they ordered online themselves and nothing has happened.  The did not have bleeding or pain or they had had very little bleeding.  It is clear that whatever they were given did not contain any active ingredients.  We have no idea of the conditions in which that sort of medication is being made.  It may not be safe.  It may contain ingredients which are not safe for people to take.  It is certainly misleading and it gives women the impression, particularly if they have a small amount of bleeding afterwards, that they may have ended their pregnancy when in fact they have not.  In the event of someone being at a later stage of gestation than she thought, there is a greater chance of the medication not working and, therefore, a greater chance that the pregnancy will continue.  It is dangerous to expose a pregnancy to some of those medications if it then continues.<\/p> <p>  There is not a huge number of complications in these cases, but there is one very simple thing about which I would be concerned when women are accessing pills online.  If anybody who has a miscarriage, abortion or full-term delivery is rhesus negative, which is a blood type, she needs to get anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent damage to any subsequent pregnancies.  These women are clearly not getting that because they are not seeing a health care provider.  My final concern, which I have already mentioned, is the fear that the small number of women who have excessive bleeding are delaying coming to see somebody because they are afraid of getting into trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Following on from that, if the medication is not what it is supposed to be, does it pose the prospect of later travel and an abortion being procured later as a consequence of that delay?

To follow on from some of Deputy Daly's questions on contraception, I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong but I believe they are saying that greater access to contraception leads to fewer unwanted pregnancies.  Can we sum it up like that?  I have tabled a parliamentary question on today's Order Paper, No. 76, which basically asks the Minister for Health the cost to the Exchequer of contraceptives over the past ten years.  I did not table the question just for the good of my health.  I intend to propose that all women in Ireland be provided with free contraception, in the same way as proposed by Deputy Daly, to whom I have spoken about it.  I worked in community pharmacy before and we had difficulty in accessing emergency contraception at the weekend and the Minister introduced a statutory instrument.  Based on what the witnesses have said today and the work which has already been done by members of the committee, it is a no-brainer for us to call for universal access to contraceptives for women in Ireland.<\/p><p>Dr. Henchion referred to long-acting, reversible contraceptives.  The cost of the Mirena coil allowed on the drug payment scheme is &euro;144, providing coverage for five years, give or take, which is &euro;2.40 per calendar month.  That is not a massive sum of money.  Dr. Henchion is talking about the outlay.  I have come across people who have put off having the relevant procedure for financial reasons.<br\/><br\/>We are discussing  socioeconomic reasons today but I want to move away from the economic element to the social one.  One of my sisters had babies in that wonderful hospital in Cork.  I was interested to see that domestic violence goes from one in eight in normal circumstances in Cork, or the regions served by Cork, to one in five when a woman is pregnant.  My understanding is that economic factors have no influence on this.  The committee needs to know that women are much more likely to suffer from domestic violence if they are pregnant.  I should not say that is not only in Cork.  However, the study was conducted in Cork and the surrounding region.  What emerged from it conjures up the idea that women with crisis pregnancies may be trapped in relationships where they are forced to become parents against their will.  Can Dr. Henchion tell me if there is any impediment to a woman's requesting a hysterectomy?  If I decided tomorrow that my periods were too heavy or too difficult and I was low in iron and wrecked all the time, would I have to go to a court to ask that my reproductive organs be removed?  Do I have to clear it with anyone other than my doctor?<br\/><br\/>Referring to something my Fine Gael colleague said, that we do not have any babies to adopt, are we moving into a situation reminiscent of <i>The Handmaid's Tale<\/i>, whereby women with crisis pregnancies will be detained, forced to become parents and used as a source of supply of babies for childless people?  That is up there with the most shocking thing I have heard today and I am hoping to God nobody forces me into that situation.  Good luck to them if they do.<br\/><br\/>I want to correct something that was said by the good Senator Mullen.  <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>did not carry out the investigation into the doctors.

There would be surgical sterilisation operations available to women where the tubes are tied or ligatured.  That is available but logistically it is not very practical because it takes probably over a year for a routine gynaecological appointment to come to the top of the list.  Then, having been seen, the woman may be rejected on the grounds of not enough children, too young or various matters like that.  The woman is then put on a second waiting list - to actually get the procedure done - if that is deemed to be suitable.  There are women who want a permanent method and do not want to have to keep on renewing contraceptive methods.   I would always say that I refer them but they need to do something else now because they will be waiting two to three years for that to become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does anybody intervene, apart from in the context of the conversation between the woman and her doctor to stop her having that procedure?

For a while it felt as if they were on trial.  It is an awful shame to sit on a committee like this, which should be about women and how women are affected, and have the conversation dragged away from that and off in another direction.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to ask have been answered but I would like to tease out some of the socioeconomic reasons.  As a recommendation, there is probably a lack of understanding of what that means.  Initially I recall celebrating this recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.  I received commentary to the effect that it referred to poverty and wanting to abort children born into poverty.  There was a real lack of understanding that this concerns women who are affected in some way by their socioeconomic circumstances and that covers many issues, including mental health, addiction and age.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to sit here every week and separate the political from the personal, particularly as a woman who has probably experienced many of the things we speak about every week.  I was a service user of the IFPA.  I had a crisis pregnancy and I ticked as many boxes as a woman possibly could at the age of 15.  I found the service amazing.  It was comforting and the counselling I received there was very good.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about representing women with crisis pregnancies who proceeded to have children.  I am one of those women and I represent them here.  However, this does not mean that I am of the view that women should not have a choice.  I was given that choice earlier.  This is not a question of the witnesses coming in here to promote abortion, which is how it is being sold.  The IFPA definitely did not sell abortion to me at the age of 15.  I want to put that on the record and to commend the organisation.  As a community worker who works with women in deprivation, I continued to refer women who found themselves in that situation to the IFPA and I would continue to do that, no matter what is said here today.<\/p> <p>  To tease out the socioeconomic circumstances, the witnesses have some of those reasons in the vignettes.  I want to capture today not the barrier to women travelling - because we know that the socioeconomic situation is a factor - but how we begin to create criteria that encompass everything that socioeconomic status can affect.  That exists in other countries.  What falls under it and how?  Is it impossible and should we just go for it without restriction?  If we do not have a ground for socioeconomic reasons should we increase the number of weeks for providing it without restriction because sometimes those socioeconomic factors might not come to light until later?<\/p> <p>  I probably have not been very clear.  It is difficult to separate the personal from the political when I sit in this room.  Perhaps we can speak more to the impact of socioeconomic status on women's decisions.  The witnesses referred to women's aspirations and, for example, a woman wanting to go college and being the first person in her family to do that.  Will people take seriously the fact that women seeking abortion are likely to talk about their own aspirations and what they want in terms of quality of life?  How do we capture that in a doctor's waiting room?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>There is a lot in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I do not think any of it made sense.

If somebody feels that in her particular set of circumstances she cannot continue with the pregnancy, we have to trust her.  In having a consultation with somebody, we have to trust that those appear to be real concerns and that is the decision the person has made.  Obviously, if somebody is not actually certain of what she wants to do, then it is not anybody's role to try to convince her to go in one direction or another.  The role of any consultation, any first contact, will be to identify those women who need more support with their decision and make sure that they get those supports, whether they are financial, practical or more counselling and more time.  That is really where the important thing comes in about identifying socioeconomic problems and making sure that those women get the resources so that socioeconomic factors do not necessarily have to be deciding factors in what they do about their crisis pregnancy.

We see the eighth amendment making no impact on the number of women travelling to the UK.  When we get to 2001 and 2002, however, we see a change, a reduction.  It is an interesting point.  Why have we got this reduction?  Why have we got this doubling of the figures in the 18 years after 1983 and then a reduction in the last 16 years that is almost consistent across all the years?

The service has been around a long time.  I used it in the 1980s during much darker days for women in terms of accessing reproductive health care.  I was afraid to go to my doctor to ask for a coil or the morning after pill and I shared such fear with many women of my generation because we were in those dark times during the 1980s.  If one could not afford a private clinic, the only place one could go was the Irish Family Planning Association and it continues to play that role.  I will never forget the helpless bewilderment on the faces of counsellors when I told them I wanted an abortion.  In those days they could not even give me information on how to go about that because it was before the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 and it was illegal to give me the phone number of an abortion clinic in Liverpool.  I had to get that number under my own steam.  I thank the doctors, counsellors and those who worked tirelessly for women over the past decades and provided those services throughout the country.  In many cases it was not just in respect of contraception but general sexual health.<\/p> <p>  As regards the socioeconomic point and the question of the increasing number of women who are in crisis pregnancies because of poverty, do the witnesses have any evidence that poverty impacts on the level of crisis pregnancy?  The lack of access to proper contraception such as the permanent reversible contraception of which the witness spoke is a contributory factor.  I think it important to repeat something Dr. Henchion said in her submission.  She said: \"I frequently see women who, having paid all of the costs of going to a private clinic for an abortion, for example, perhaps &euro;600 for an abortion at ten weeks plus the cost of her travel, cannot afford to pay for post-abortion contraception, particularly their preferred method of a long-acting reversible method of contraception\".  Is it not a huge indictment of the services here that we are supposed to be concerned about the protection of life in our laws which say we are concerned about the foetus and the unborn yet socioeconomically we are condemning more women to crisis pregnancies because of the inaffordability of proper contraception?  Can the witnesses confirm if that is the case?<\/p> <p>  An alarming statement made by Dr. Henchion which flies in the face of what was said about Ireland being one of the safest countries in which to be pregnant is that the increased clandestine and illegal use of the abortion pill means more and more women are left without follow-up post-abortion care.  She also said that many of the women she sees do not come back to the IFPA for post-abortion care.  Perhaps she could explain why that is so.  I suspect it is related to the socioeconomic poverty reasons I have mentioned.  Are those who say this is the safest place in the world in which to be pregnant taking into account the IFPA statement which says that a substantial number of women are accessing illegal abortions through the abortion pill and, therefore, do not have follow-up care?  \"It is an unregulated and unsafe practice, the harms of which are not being reviewed or measured by any public body.  No one is being held accountable for this, and the Government cannot continue to ignore it.\"  That is an extremely strong statement.  I would like the witnesses to expand on how we, as a society, are leaving ourselves and society as a whole but women in particular open to severe consequences through ignoring their reproductive health in this manner or making it illegal for them to take certain actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#M00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>One of the first things one has to do for a health measure to be widely adopted is to get rid of cost.  That is what we do with vaccination programmes.  One could point out that if people valued it enough they would still get it but if one wants everybody to do so, one must get rid of the cost.  That is what is done for public health issues.  If we want to tackle the issue of crisis pregnancy, contraception and sexual health education has to be looked at as a public health issue and money must be taken out of the equation in order that it cannot be a factor.<\/p> <p>  It is not enough to only take out the cost of contraception.  One needs to make people aware of the issues involved or they will not access contraceptive services in the first place.  That definitely links in to socioeconomic factors because, as I said, a girl who leaves school early may have missed out on contraceptive education at school because it might have been delivered too late.  A girl who does not attend school very frequently may not have received that education.  We need to address that issue and ensure we are looking at it as a public health measure.<\/p> <p>  There are many reasons why women do not come for post-abortion care.  It is a difficult question to answer because if they do not attend, I do not see them and, therefore, cannot answer completely for those who do not come.  Some women come to the IFPA and are very anxious about doing so.  They are anxious that they may have a complication or about being judged and the attitudes that people might have towards them and are at pains to try to justify their decision because they think others might feel abortion is only okay for some people.  Those are reasons that people might not want to come.  Because many women do not see a health care provider before they have an abortion, in order to do so afterwards they have to again find out where that service is and then go and tell their story all over again to a new person and that is a difficulty.  If they were going back to the place where they had the abortion, that would not be a deterrent.  Those are some of the reasons women do not attend for care.<\/p> <p>  The risk to a woman's life as a result of an illegal abortion using online medication is exceptionally low but that is not to say that women using such medication have a good health care experience.  There may be minor or low-level risks such as not getting their contraception or enduring a procedure that is painful, uncomfortable and frightening while being alone with absolutely no support and nowhere to which to turn and being worried that if something goes wrong they will be found out rather than get help.

Does she seek his counsel or advice?  Does he have a role in this decision or is he out of the equation?  If the woman in question is exceptionally young, would Dr. Henchion welcome engagement and seek involvement from her parents?<\/p> <p>  I am somewhat concerned about Dr. Henchion's statement that she has seen many women who have had illegal abortions performed.  I am not quite sure what her position is on that.  When a woman comes to Dr. Henchion and says she has had an illegal abortion - I would have the utmost sympathy for the woman - is it not illegal?  If something is illegal, it is illegal.  Does Dr. Henchion think it is incumbent on the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, to share that information or in any way refer it to a statutory body or State agency such as the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#N00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>On the question of whether we seek the involvement of the putative father in the case, the answer is \"No\", we do not.

We are probably only seeing a very tiny percentage of those women who are having illegal abortions, because they are reluctant to come and they will only come if there is a problem.  On the question of whether I would report those women, I do not.  I feel my primary concerns are their confidentiality and health and well-being.

They have an idea about where they want to go if they have made up their mind that they want to have an abortion.  They may have a question.  The other major shift we have seen is that the stigma is reducing, although it is still there and plays a huge part.  The woman coming to us now will probably have told more people now than the woman who came to us 20 years ago about her intention either to have an abortion or if she is coming back for post-abortion care having had an abortion.  We put this down to a breaking down of the stigma.  We see more of our clients now presenting with someone.

My name is Janice Donlon and I am the project manager for funded services with the Health Service Executive, HSE, sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  I am joined today by Helen Deely who is the head of the programme.  We have been asked to address the committee on the supports provided by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme and on the use of the abortion pill.<br\/><br\/>The information will be presented in two sections: first, I will outline supports provided by the programme to those experiencing a crisis pregnancy.  I will then talk about behavioural trends and research relating to crisis pregnancy including use of the abortion pill.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme is a national programme situated within the health and well-being division of the HSE.  The programme is mandated by a statutory instrument to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to provide support to those who have a crisis pregnancy.  Legislation defines crisis pregnancy as &quot;a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her&quot;.  The programme understands this definition to also include the experiences of those women for whom a planned or desired pregnancy develops into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances.<br\/><br\/>A pregnancy may be considered a crisis for several reasons.  Crisis pregnancy can be related to a perceived inability to cope with a child at that time; being too young or too old; not being in a financial position to support a child; and the potential impact that becoming a parent at that point might have on their education, training or employment.  Research finds that approximately one third of women who have been pregnant and one fifth of men who have experienced a pregnancy in their lifetime have experienced a crisis pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>The programme funds 15 individual crisis pregnancy counselling services which operate out of 40 plus locations nationwide to provide free crisis pregnancy counselling.  Details of these crisis pregnancy counselling services can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>.  Crisis pregnancy counselling and information on all three options: parenting, adoption and abortion are provided under the legal framework of Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, also known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Crisis pregnancy counselling services are funded by the HSE under detailed governance arrangements and underpinned by a quality framework including access to supervision and training supports and guidelines and protocols to support services and their staff working in this complex area.<br\/><br\/>Counselling for a woman involves creating space to allow her to discuss and reflect on her crisis pregnancy and to support her through the decision-making process.  While many women experiencing a crisis pregnancy resolve the crisis for themselves, or have support from family and friends, research finds that they see a clear role for a counsellor.  The importance of a supportive listener and non-judgmental support allows them to consider how the pregnancy impacts on their lives.  It is the counsellor's role to provide space and time to facilitate women to work through difficult conflicts in a non-judgmental and non-directive manner.<br\/><br\/>During a counselling session the client may request information on the options available to her.  Any woman considering parenting a child will be made aware of the various organisations and community support groups that offer information and support in relation to parenting, either alone or as a couple.  Many of these organisations are also funded through the programme.  Such organisations and groups have detailed user-friendly booklets touching on many issues of parenting, including information on rights and entitlements and accessing support services.<br\/><br\/>In respect of adoption crisis pregnancy counsellors are able to provide a client with some of the basic principles surrounding the process of adoption and the rights of birth parents and adoptive parents.  However, if a woman chooses adoption as an option she will be appropriately counselled and advised at all stages of the adoption process by an adoption social worker, either with the Tusla adoption service or an accredited body.<br\/><br\/>If, after appropriate counselling on all options, a woman makes the decision to terminate her pregnancy she should be given as much information as is necessary.  Information about abortion services in other countries may be made available under certain conditions.  The law on the subject was passed in 1995 and is usually known as the abortion information Act.  The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals.  Information on how to access abortion services, including names and addresses of clinics can be provided as can information on the types of procedure that may be available to her.  Crisis pregnancy counsellors are not medically trained and any specific medical questions are referred to the woman's general practitioner.<br\/><br\/>All information should be provided in a manner that is accurate, unbiased, impartial and in accordance with the law.  This is necessary to allow the woman to make an informed decision as to the most appropriate course of action for her.  Information may be given in different formats, including written material which the client can take home with her.<br\/><br\/>The numbers of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services has fallen significantly in recent years.  In 2010 4,662 individual clients attended for crisis pregnancy counselling, by 2016 that number had fallen to 2,570.  The majority of women attending crisis pregnancy counselling services are between the ages of 25 and 34.<\/p><p>It is recognised by us and the services that in the 20 years since the commencement of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act,1995 there have been many developments in technology, including access to the Internet.  Many women are now bypassing crisis pregnancy counselling services and accessing information on abortion services directly from the Internet.  While the numbers attending services are decreasing, counselling services report that those attending services are presenting with more complex and multiple issues.  The challenge for the programme and the counselling services is to ensure that women in most need of crisis pregnancy services and supports feel that the services are relevant to them and will meet their needs.<br\/><br\/>Many of the counselling services funded by the programme also support women and their partners through the diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality or life limiting condition.  Additional training and support has been provided to these services to ensure they are able to respond to the needs of this client group.  Counselling services have forged links with maternity units and have the expertise and the capacity to support women and their partners through this difficult time.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the issue of crisis pregnancy agencies, which are not funded by the State.  Some organisations that advertise as crisis pregnancy counselling services have a hidden agenda.  The service they provide is designed to influence the choice a woman makes and to pressure a woman into doing something she may not want to do.  Once these agencies have been contacted by a client they can seek to delay the counselling process and, in certain cases, show clients inappropriate images or use other tactics in an effort to influence their decision.  These organisations are not State funded and women are advised to find out as much information as possible about a pregnancy service before they make an appointment.  All HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme funded services are advertised on <i>positiveoptions.ie<\/i>and will provide non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.<br\/><br\/>Post-abortion services that are available include post-abortion counselling provided by the same funded services which provide crisis pregnancy counselling,.  Details of these post-abortion counselling providers are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Information on the availability of free post-abortion counselling in Ireland is also provided by abortion clinics in the UK and the Netherlands.  The programme links with abortion providers to ensure the information is made available to women who have travelled from Ireland.  Post-abortion psychological support allows a woman a safe space in which to explore and articulate her feelings, whatever they may be, towards the decision made and perhaps the experience of the abortion itself.  A client may require a number of counselling sessions post abortion and the counsellor is available to support the woman depending on her individual needs.  A woman may attend for post-abortion counselling shortly after her abortion or she may attend at a later stage if issues emerge related to other life events.  The number of women who access post-abortion counselling has remained steady over the last number of years and in 2016 a total of 1,377 clients were seen for post-abortion counselling.<br\/><br\/>A post-abortion medical check-up is also available for women to ensure they have fully recovered from their procedure.  A post-abortion check-up normally involves a blood pressure check and an examination of the woman's abdomen.  The doctor will confirm that the pregnancy has ended, check that bleeding pattern is normal and there is no infection and will assist the client with their contraceptive needs.<br\/><br\/>A number of the services funded to provide crisis pregnancy and post-abortion counselling services also provide free post-abortion medical check-ups.  The details of these services are available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie<\/i>.  Attendance at the medical checkup also allows an opportunity for the doctor to refer the women to post-abortion counselling if such a referral appears beneficial.  The numbers attending these services is low; in 2016, a total of 442 women attended medical check-ups funded by the programme.  Women may attend their GP on their return if required or, depending on the type of procedure they have undergone, may not require a post-abortion medical check-up, for example with early medical abortion.<br\/><br\/>I shall now address some behavioural trends and the research relating to crisis pregnancy, including use of the abortion pill.  As a core function of its work, the programme monitors behavioural trends relating to its mandates, using a range of tools and indicators including general population surveys and statistics.  Research informs us that crisis pregnancies happen to women and their partners from all different ages, socio-economic backgrounds and with different relationship statuses.  The majority are married, engaged or in steady relationships when the crisis pregnancy occurs.  The most common reasons the pregnancy is seen as a crisis is because it was not planned or the woman and her partner consider themselves too young.  The average age at which a crisis pregnancy occurs is stable at 24 years for women and 25 years for men.<br\/><br\/>When we consider the outcomes of crisis pregnancy we can see that parenting is by far the most common outcome for those who experience a crisis pregnancy.  A survey of the general population found that when asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy 73% of women reported that they chose to parent.  In the same general population survey, 2% of those asked about their most recent crisis pregnancy reported that they chose adoption.  Traditionally in Ireland adoption was a common response for women experiencing a crisis pregnancy; however, the number of women placing their babies for adoption has decreased significantly in recent decades.  A figure of 24% of women in the same general population survey who reported experience of a crisis pregnancy reported that they chose to have an abortion following their most recent crisis pregnancy. <br\/><br\/>With regard to abortions in other jurisdictions it is well documented that many women travel from Ireland to other countries to access legal abortion services.  The programme analyses data collated by the Department of Health in the UK and the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands on the number of women travelling to those countries from Ireland for an abortion on an annual basis.  In the majority of cases, women travelling from Ireland for an abortion travel to England.  In 2016, a total of 3,265 women gave Irish addresses at UK abortion services, representing a rate of 3.2 per 1,000 women.  There has been a gradual decline in the number of women availing of abortion services in the UK since 2001.  In that year there were 6,673 abortions to women from Ireland in UK abortion clinics, representing a rate of 7.5 per 1,000 women.  The Ministry of Health in the Netherlands has collated data on women providing Irish addresses in Dutch abortion clinics since 2010.  Prior to 2010, the programme linked directly with the main abortion service providers in the Netherlands to establish the number of women providing Irish addresses there.  In 2015, 34 women were recorded to have provided Irish addresses in abortion clinics in the Netherlands.  These figures have significantly declined since their peak in 2006 when the number was 461.  The Netherlands has emerged as the only other jurisdiction to which women from Ireland have been travelling for abortion procedures in any significant numbers.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the numbers of abortions in Ireland under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  The Act defines the circumstances within which abortion in Ireland can be legally performed.  The total number of abortions carried out in accordance with this Act in 2016 was 25.  There were 26 in each of the years 2014 and 2015, with 2014 being the first year in which data was reported.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of abortion pills, they are designed to induce an abortion for a woman who is less than nine weeks pregnant.  Abortion pills are used by abortion providers in medically supervised clinics in countries where abortion is legal.  These are referred to as medical abortions.  The programme is aware that some women are accessing abortion pills in Ireland from international online providers.  In order to try to understand the incidence of this, the programme set up a reporting relationship with the Health Products Regulatory Authority in relation to the number of abortion pills seized by customs officers annually.  The programme has provided training and support to all funded services on this emerging issue.  All services have developed protocols in this area and training manuals and online resources have been updated with relevant information.<br\/><br\/>The reasons women may be accessing abortion pills online are cost and access.  For women who have made the decision to terminate a pregnancy, the cost associated with travelling from Ireland to another country for a medically supervised termination is high.  Research finds that higher earning women are more likely to travel to other countries for abortions over their lower earning counterparts.  Until recently it was difficult to make an assessment of the level to which this practice is occurring as limited information was available.  Recently published research suggests that more women are contacting online providers of abortion pills annually and becoming more aware about the availability of these drugs online.  As the committee has been informed by a previous witness Dr. Abigail Aiken, her study found that over the period January 2010 to December 2016 the number of women from Ireland who contacted an online provider of abortion pills tripled.  In 2010 there were 548 online consultations completed by women from the island of Ireland.  In 2016, the number had increased to 1,748.<br\/><br\/>Another research article, published by the same authors in 2017, reports on the experiences of women following taking the abortion pill in Ireland.  The study reports on 1,000 women who underwent self-sourced medical abortion from the online service.  The study reports that while the vast majority of women did not need to contact medical services following taking the abortion pill at home, approximately one in ten - 9.3% - reported to the online provider that they were experiencing a symptom for which they were advised to seek medical advice and the vast majority of these women sought medical advice as advised.<\/p><p>The programme has identified one other main provider of the abortion pill and has sought similar information from this provider for a more accurate assessment of the trend.<br\/><br\/>If a woman takes an abortion pill and has prolonged heavy bleeding, bad pain, fainting or other complications we strongly encourage that she attends an emergency department or GP straight away.  If a woman is concerned about her health following taking an abortion pill, we would encourage her to attend a free post-abortion medical check-up funded by the HSE.  A list of these services is available on <i>abortionaftercare.ie. <\/i><br\/><br\/>I thank the committee members for their attention.

I thank Ms Donlon for coming to the committee today and for her presentation.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the HSE crisis pregnancy website.  It states that it has three mandates, one of which is \"A reduction in the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services and support which make other options more attractive\".  I am a little bit confused because page 2 of Ms Donlon's presentation says that the HSE services are to be provided in a non-directive, non-judgmental and client-centred manner.  If a woman feels that her needs are best met by an abortion what are these other options that the HSE mentions on its website? Is this a case of directive counselling to the woman to continue with the pregnancy or are there other options we are unaware of?  Perhaps Ms Donlon will elaborate on these because it appears to me to be contradictory with regard to the HSE website and what Ms Donlon has said here.  I can see only two options available for women in those circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for the questions.  The mandates certainly set out the exploring of other options.  The way that we interpret the mandates, as set out by the crisis pregnancy legislation, is by providing non-directive and non-judgmental counselling.  That is set out in the law also in respect of providing that level of support for women.  We feel that counselling provides the space and the time for women to explore all of their options in a safe, secure and non-judgmental manner.  We absolutely are not directive in any of our instructions around our mandates and we absolutely support the provision on non-directive, non-judgmental counselling.  Counselling allows women the space and time to discuss all of her options, and to explore how each of the options may impact on her life.  If the woman wants to explore the option of parenting she is given enough support and information to consider that and how it would impact on her individual set of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The programme has provided funding over the years to other organisations to provide supports to those who choose to parent.  A number of the organisations we fund provide support and training to one parent families and additional supports in that area.  Equally, we provide funding to a crisis pregnancy counselling service that has expertise in adoption.  If a woman chooses to explore that option she is given enough information to be able to make that decision.  Our mandates allow us to ensure that women are directed towards counselling that is non-judgmental and non-directive.  This is what we fund in counselling services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donlon for that answer.

Some women do and our services are available to those women.

She cannot believe that she is pregnant and the counsellor's role is to support the woman through that crisis, to support her through the decisions she will make and support her in teasing out how those decisions will impact on her life.

Let me put it this way: we operate within a constitutional framework where the unborn baby is another person to be protected by Irish law, the second human being involved in the equation.  In other areas of our culture, we have very good, proactive and State-funded activity designed to discourage behaviours that might be harmful to individuals themselves or to a third party.  I am thinking about anti-drink and anti-smoking campaigns, drink-driving, and, increasingly, anti-obesity.  These campaigns are publicly funded.  One would not so much describe them as directive and judgmental because they do not judge the people and nor do they require or coerce certain kinds of behaviour, but they do clearly encourage or indeed discourage certain behaviours.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect Ms Donlon to comment on the anomaly, because that would bring her into the realm of policy, but it seems anomalous that, on the one hand, we can encourage certain kinds of behaviours for the sake of protecting an individual, or a third party in the case of drinking and driving and so on, but that when it comes to the protection of the unborn and how that intersects with Ms Donlon's work, it seems to me that the positive options notion sums up her activity, which is to say that as long as the information is procured, supplied and accurately provided when requested, Ms Donlon's job is done.  Is this because the programme sees itself as being curbed by legislation that there is not something more proactive done given our constitutional position, which one would understand ought to tend the State towards protecting the unborn?  I am asking about things like recommending adoption or requiring that State-funded agencies propose or speak positively of adoption as an alternative.<\/p> <p>  I am also talking about things like informed consent.  We had a hearing last week in which it was not effectively accepted but it was certainly not contradicted, that there is no evidence linking abortion with increased mental health outcomes, yet mental health is what is on the Statute Book in Britain and it is what has opened up a large number of abortions.  Mental health was also cited by the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, here earlier.  Does the HSE crisis pregnancy programme require, as a matter of informed consent, that counsellors draw a woman's attention to the possibility that if she had, for example, a previous mental health history she might be at risk of adverse mental health sequelae in the context of abortion?  This is no more and no less than the precise truth.<\/p> <p>  Take the question of ultrasound.  I am not asking Ms Donlon whether it ought to be required that a woman see an ultrasound, but ought it be required of counsellors that they offer that in a respectful way and in a way that always respects a woman's right to refuse, but also in a way that allows the provision and sharing of full information, all of which might act to encourage the life-giving choice at the end of the day?  Does Ms Donlon see that as outside of her mandate?  Would it require a change of law in her view for public policy to go down that road in the light of what the eighth amendment currently states as a matter of public policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#W01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen has spoken for five minutes now.

She is seen in a non-judgmental and non-directive way in relation to the provision of information.  That is how the counselling services operate, and it is good counselling practice to operate in that manner.  The individual is coming to the counsellor in a crisis.

When listening to Ms Donlon's presentation, I reflected on the fact that it has been many years since I marched with my mother on the streets of Dublin for the right to information.  I said to my mother at the time, \"This is ridiculous.  This is only information.\"  Of course, now there is a raft of information available, not only from the HSE.  Ms Donlon states that there has been a gradual decline in the numbers travelling and a gradual increase in the number of women who are accessing abortion pills online.  Presumably, given that the one is going down and the other is going up, we can say that the number of women accessing abortion care is remaining relatively steady, as is the number availing of counselling, 442, which, as Ms Donlon said, is very low.  There is an great deal of information out there, which can be accessed with a few clicks of a mouse.  Women know that the services are available, that the aftercare and emotional support are there, should they require them.  However, the figure for those availing of counselling remains consistently low.  Would it be true to say that this would indicate that women are happy with their choice and have no need for follow-up counselling?  Perhaps Ms Donlon could elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  On the rogue agencies, I am thinking particularly about work done by the journalist Ellen Coyne on those agencies that will tell women that if they have had abortions, they are at greater risk of breast cancer and other nonsense of that nature which we know has no basis in medicine.  Ms Donlon says those agencies target women in crisis pregnancy.  Could she elaborate on how that is done?  I echo what my colleague said - we do not often find ourselves agreeing with Fine Gael but we will say so when it happens.  I welcome the moves by the Minister to regulate these agencies, particularly those which were highlighted in the reports and which are giving that sort of information to women who, in some instances, are frightened.  How is that targeting happening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01000","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I might take that question first.  What we have seen and through our communications unit in the HSE, is that women seek information about abortion services and crisis pregnancies primarily online, through a Google search.  These rogue, disingenuous agencies are targeting women by increasing their spend on paid AdWords on Google.  We in the HSE try to combat that by outbidding them in terms of search words.  It is a constant battle.  We are trying to ensure that our information about the funded services, the Positive Options information, comes up first on Google searches and that these rogue services are not the first result that somebody will see.  I think in the past they may have taken out advertisements in the Golden Pages and the agency and the programme would have tried to combat that by taking out bigger advertisements.  It is a matter of trying to keep up with them at all times.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that they regularly change their names.  While we may have been aware of some of them in the past, they have now changed their name so it is very hard to track.  They change their locations.  It is very difficult to deter women from a certain agency when we do not know where it is actually located.  It is incredibly difficult and the services we fund, which see these women after they have been through traumatic experiences, would certainly let us know that women are traumatised.  They do not want to go through a complaints procedure against these organisations.  We have a complaints mechanism in place if a woman wants to go ahead in that regard.  Often, the woman just wants to get the non-directive, non-judgmental counselling in order to get through her crisis and does not want to revisit a very difficult time.<\/p> <p>  We would absolutely welcome the regulation of counselling services.  The counselling services we fund would also welcome it.  Counselling in general is not regulated.  There is no regulatory body over it.  In the absence of regulation, what the HSE has done in terms of the crisis pregnancy counselling services is to provide training and support for counsellors in a non-regulated environment.  We have robust service arrangements with all of the organisations and put funding into training for individual counsellors.  They have access to supervision as well in terms of their counselling practice.  In order to level the playing field in terms of transparency of crisis pregnancy services, I think regulation certainly will help.<\/p> <p>  What was the Deputy's previous question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>It was to do with the numbers.

We are discussing socioeconomic status and disadvantage in the context of women and the choices they make.  Looking at the Positive Options website and the clinics that provide counselling services - which the HSE funds - I counted 32 or 33 locations but Ms Donlon says it is 40 and I accept that.  I did not look at the geographical spread in respect of them but I want to make a point about access to full information for all women across all centres in Ireland.  Outside of the urban centres, it might be more difficult for women to access a crisis pregnancy counselling service.  Would Ms Donlon comment on that?  It makes it more difficult and therefore the question of socioeconomic and economic disadvantage applies very much more for people who are not near an urban centre where they have choices in the type of counselling received.<\/p><p> My second question is on the list of agencies under Positive Options, approximately one third of which are run by Anew and Cura.  On their websites, both organisations state that they do not provide contact details for abortion clinics or abortion information services, but they will discuss.  It was stated here that the legal framework for providing information on abortion requires that individuals must be given access to the information.  If the only resource available to a poor woman is provided by Anew or Cura, which will not discuss abortion, why are they funded by the crisis pregnancy programme to provide one third of counselling services while failing to give women full access to all of the options they have?  Does it not further disadvantage women who are socially and economically in a bottom bracket?  While Anew or Cura will not provide the information women need on abortion, they will provide the name of a doctor or other service they can attend.  Does it not compound their disadvantage and possibly even the delay in procuring an abortion?  Women need and want to have access to abortion as early as possible but this seems to be an anomaly.  Why does a State agency such as the crisis pregnancy programme fund services which will not provide the full information to women?  They state on their website that they will discuss but not provide the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#X01400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We fund 15 services providing crisis pregnancy counselling, two of which, the Deputy is right to state, do not provide, due to their ethos, information on names and addresses of abortion clinics outside Ireland.

Also, as the Deputy has seen from their websites, the information is very clearly accessible as to what they will or will not provide.  As such, the client is made aware before she attends whether she will be provided with information on abortion services.  There is an element of choice for some women of attending a service that is not going to provide the information, or choosing another service.  They also have in place, as stated in their service arrangements with the HSE, robust referral procedures so that, if a woman they are counselling seeks information on abortion and wants the names and addresses of clinics, she can be referred to her GP or another service provider.<\/p> <p>  The counselling services certainly report to us that they will support women through the option of abortion.  The ethos of their services does not allow them to provide the names and addresses of the clinics.  Women attend crisis pregnancy counselling for a number of reasons and make decisions on their choices around their crisis pregnancies.  As our research shows, 73% of women choose to parent and many of these organisations support women through that parenting.  Even after the baby is born, they assist them with supports for new mothers.  Certainly, there is a role for the services in that regard.

Many of the questions I had have been answered so I have only two brief questions.  I apologise for interrupting Deputy Fitzpatrick earlier on but I think it is a point that is worth noting.  I probably should have waited my turn.  In respect of adoption and whether it is decreasing or not, when we are having any conversation about women and the choices they have made, we need to look at it in the context of our history, the number of women we locked away and put in mother and baby homes and the number of illegal adoptions that took place in this country.  If the research is not there, I am sure it would factor in along the way if research was ever done.  It is important to say this because I do not think any of us would ever want to advocate that we want to go back to those figures.  It just involves being mindful of those women and the fact that they probably would have chosen to rear their children had they been given the support to do so.  That was the point I was trying to make.<\/p> <p>  In respect of socio-economic matters, I know from throughout my time supporting mothers who already have children, particularly if they are at risk of homelessness or are in addiction, that they are always very cautious of seeking help, particularly from State bodies.  There is some distrust there sometimes.  If somebody is experiencing addiction, how does the counselling operate in this scenarios?  Women are sometimes petrified of being judged as mothers.  They are worried that the children they already have might be taken off them if they raise the reason that a pregnancy is such a crisis.  How do the witnesses deal with that and have they come up against it?  Is there a cohort of women who do not access services because it is a State organisation?  How can we address that?  A point was made that socio-economic inequality exists in respect of being able to travel for abortion with poorer women being more likely to turn to the abortion pill.

The options are more limited for those with lower financial means, those in situations involving domestic violence and those facing a multitude of situations whereby they are unable to make the choices their counterparts with financial means are able to make.  If we take the example of asylum seekers in particular, they are restricted in terms of their economic and social ability and the procedure they must go through should they choose the option of abortion in terms of travelling outside the State for an abortion.  They can be insurmountable to many women in terms of going through with the option they have chosen so there are a range of additional issues that influence a woman's ability to make a decision and follow through with that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Some research has been done on adoption.  The biggest contributor to the fall in adoption rates was when the State introduced payments to women who were initially called unmarried mothers that became payments which allowed people to parent alone so that women did not have to continue with a pregnancy and then give their children up, but had the right to raise their own children and had the economic basis to do so.  The evidence would support that view.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  One of the excellent parts of today's discussion has been the highlighting of the rogue agencies that are out there and the imperative on us as legislators to deal with that.  It relates to the point made by Niall Behan earlier than they are the ones that are not regulated.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how to react to this presentation because I am torn, on the one hand, by trying to get the information out there that despite criminalisation, there are State-provided services for people with crisis pregnancies before and after an abortion which women in Ireland might need tonight.  That is not well known so that is a message we need to get out.  However, on the other hand, is it not an indication of our utter sickening and depressing hypocrisy that we dance around this issue, provide State services, give a constitutional right to access a service in another state, even send the leaflets over and look after women when they come back, but we have no abortion in Ireland?  That is demoralising.  The witnesses are the ones who are implementing that farce.<\/p><p>I do not know if they can comment on it.  I am trying to address the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act and the difficulties it causes.  We have had a lot of testimony about the break in the continuum of care.  Have the HSE's service providers or the agencies it funds highlighted any particular problems?  I am thinking of the comments made by the IFPA, in particular, about deaf women.  Somebody might be given information by a service but how does a deaf person ring a clinic in England and make the appointment?  Is that not a double discriminator?  How would that be addressed?  What are the problems in terms of that legislation?  Other contributors have said contraceptive prevalence is actually the key determinant of lowering abortion rates.  Deputy O'Connell made a point earlier about universal access to contraception.  Is that something the HSE has done research on or costed?  It would be of huge benefit to people.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#Z00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act.  We acknowledged in the presentation that the Act is outdated given the current technology available to people and the access to information.  That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect the services report to us is that clients are often very surprised that when they attend a counselling service they can be given a list of names and addresses but they cannot be advised on which service might be best for them.  They cannot be referred to a service.  Their GP cannot refer them to a service and they are left alone with their list of services to contact and have to make the arrangements themselves.  The counsellor cannot support them through that element of the decision.  That is more difficult for some women than for others.  It has been highlighted that women with additional needs or financial difficulties are presented with more challenges in making those arrangements and carrying out their decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Janice Donlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I can give the committee some statistics on contraception from the ICCP study from 2003 to 2010.  It tells us that even though older age groups are less likely to use contraceptives consistently every time they have sex, there is an increase in contraceptive use across all age groups.  Condom use increased from 57% in 2003 to 62% in 2010.  Use of the pill increased from 39% to 43% in those years.  There was an increase in IUDs from 6% to 11%.  Consistent use of contraception is lower in the older age group.  That has to do with the fact that sometimes women do not believe they are fertile or are ambivalent towards becoming pregnant or would not view an unplanned pregnancy as a crisis.  Increasing access to contraception outside of medical card holders would be a policy decision.  There would need to be information and education campaigns on it in terms of consistent and proper use of contraceptives.  In our programme, we run campaigns to promote consistent use of contraceptives.  We fund the ICGP to claim for long-acting reversible contraceptives, LARC.  We also fund a national condom distribution service that distributes condoms to groups working with those at risk of HIV or STIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017111500002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Deely"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them.

It was a robust audit on policies, procedures, guidelines and protocols.  It involved in-depth interviews with staff members.  The audit made 11 recommendations, all of which have been fully implemented.  The majority of those recommendations were around improving the policies and procedures that were available in the counselling services.  We and the HSE took the broad view that we were here to support the services in terms of our funding and we supported them through additional training, updating our practice guide, our training manual and by helping them to improve their policies and procedures where there was a lack of available information highlighted by the audit.  We also implemented a quality framework with all services.  All services are signed up to a quality framework that assesses against national standards for crisis pregnancy counselling.

The Bill had been agreed on Committee Stage previously but following the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to consult with stakeholders on the provisions in the Bill and the rationale for the approach to the development of technological universities.  As part of that process a clarification document was subsequently agreed between the Department, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the Technological Higher Education Association.  TUI members voted to accept the agreement in June 2017 and suspended its industrial action in relation to the development of the technological universities.  A clarification document was also provided to IMPACT as part of this process.  The establishment of the technological universities will strengthen the skills, research and innovation capacity in the regions and support economic and social development.<\/p>  <p>  Before we discuss the amendments circulated for today I would like to notify the committee that I am also finalising additional amendments which I propose to table on Report Stage.

These regional institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions.

For the main part, they have intimated consortia that they would like to be in.  They are not going alone without any support.  Even yesterday, I announced a budget.  They had a budget last year.  There will be budgets built in to support the formation of the technological universities, TUs, throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  I have met many of the institutes of technology, IoTs, and their management.  <\/p>  <p>               Of course, there are questions.  This is a whole new merger and project.  Of course, there are many questions to be answered and solutions to be found and ironed out when a merger happens.  Deputy Troy asked specifically about Athlone.  It is clearly Government policy to consolidate institutes of technologies in a technological universities sector.  We will be building scale and capacity to make it attractive for students and staff in the regions where the technological universities are located.  Deputy Troy mentioned to me often when I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as did others, that it is very important to have skills and students in the regions.  That is one of the reasons we are strongly working to ensure students have opportunities to gain a technological university education within their region instead of having to move from the places they reside to a certain city and never going back.  We believe it will really strengthen the sector by creating universities.  We were advised by the OECD in 2004 as well as in the Hunt report about maintaining the binary divide.  We are seeking to ensure that consolidated institutes of technology bring students together and create strong universities.  We would have a critical mass of students and lecturers in an area.  That will be an add-on for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#C02300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Chairman giving me the opportunity to speak as I am not a member.  I have no intention of hogging the committee's meeting this evening.  The Minister of State referenced the Hunt report and another report, both of which were available prior to the negotiations for the programme for Government.  What I read out at the outset was a clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the mandatory need for a merger.  The Minister of State has reiterated in her feedback to me that this is no longer going to be honoured.  That is a straight question.  Is the Government rowing back on the commitment given in the programme for Government?  That is my first question.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that there is an urgent need to advance this critical legislation.  That the first amendment is to change its date from 2015 to 2017 indicates the length of time this has been ongoing.  I do not want it to get out there that I am trying to say, \"Athlone deserves it\".  It is up to Athlone or any other institute of technology to make its case based on the required areas of research and the level of doctoral or equivalent training among its teaching staff.  If an institute does not meet the high test set down, it will not be able to apply for university status.  If it does meet that, however, it should not be prevented.  I am making the case strongly because this was inserted in the programme for Government with Athlone Institute of Technology in mind.  Given its location, there are no nearby institutes with which it can merge.  The only benefit of a merger for Athlone would simply relate to scale and the number of pupils.  It would have nothing to do with the quality of the education being provided.

I have visited it not only as the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, but also in my last role.  In any of the messages I got from industries and businesses that opened in and around Athlone, Roscommon or Mullingar in particular, I heard the highest of praise for Athlone Institute of Technology, so I am a huge fan of AIT.

TU4Dublin will be 27,880 students; Munster TU, approximately 13,495: the Connacht-Ulster technological university alliance, 15,910; and TU south east, 14,612.  We believe having a critical mass is really important.  According to the figures for Athlone IT that I have before me, there was a student cohort of 4,890 in 2015-16, while Dundalk's was 4,999.  Our plan is to put the colleges and ITs together and create a critical mass and a choice for students in order that they can go from level 6 right up to doctorate level if they so wish.  As I said, at any stage single ITs can apply for technological university recognition, but they must be a consortium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#H00900","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":638,"content":"<p>This is very important.  Deputy Byrne asked the Minister of State earlier - and I would like it confirmed - whether the Government is actually committing to the retention of all the institutes of technology and the campuses in the diverse locations in which they exist around the country.  For instance, in Blanchardstown, and similarly in Tallaght, the student population is relatively small compared to the mass of DIT.  Many institutions are small but absolutely vital in terms of third level educational access for the people who live in the catchment areas.  For instance, Blanchardstown attracts not just, as one might expect, a significant number of students from the north west of Dublin, but also a very significant number of students from Meath, and that has always been the case.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that the campuses will remain and that there will not be another agenda of slimming down the institutions as a consequence of the merger.  This is a legitimate issue for local areas where, particularly if they are trying to attract foreign direct investment, having an institute of technology or being part in the future of a technological university is a really significant and important draw when trying to attract investment to the area.  <\/p>  <p>               The reason IBM came to west Dublin in the early 1990s was because people like me were campaigning to have an institute of technology, which did happen.

Committee members have raised good issues, and perhaps there is something to which we could all agree on Report Stage that could be drafted by the Government.  This is what I suggest.  Deputies Martin and Funchion have raised issues.  It is not a function of a technological university in this section to promote gender equity, for example.  I know there is provision regarding gender equality slightly further on.  As far as I know, it is a function of the DIT legislation that gender equity is promoted.  Perhaps someone can highlight it if I am wrong and I would be delighted to hear it.  It is something that has to be included.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge emphasis, and perhaps it is proper emphasis, on business and enterprise and developing an entrepreneurial culture, but there are many courses which do not relate to business and enterprise and a lot of academic disciplines that do not, such as social care, social work and education.  There are many areas.  I am thinking in particular about art and design also.  As far as I know, the institute of art and design would qualify under this legislation to seek to be part of a consortium.  There is art for art's sake, and design for design's sake and they are very important.  They should not necessarily have to be about the needs of business.  There is also culture agus an Gaeilge freisin.  Some of this can be part of a strategic plan, but we need to give more of an emphasis.  The cultural and social development of the State is mentioned, but business and enterprise are emphasised and they seem to be what hits one and what comes out.<\/p>  <p>  There is another amendment in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Lawless.  My understanding of his proposal, and he is our science spokesperson, is there such a thing as science discovery for the sake of science discovery.  It might not necessarily be directly relevant to a local employer in Blanchardstown but it could benefit the State hugely.  <\/p>  <p>                 I have a slight concern with the reference to the community in the region.  I spoke to the officials and they helpfully advised that this wording came from the Parliamentary Counsel.  There seems to be many communities in the regions that these institutions are serving.  That relates to amendment No. 29.  I urge the Government to reconsider that.  The purpose of Committee Stage is for us to go through the Bill line by line but it would be helpful for the Government to at least consider the points we are making and come forward with an amendment on Report Stage which we could hopefully all buy into.  Issues have been raised and the legislation has been lying around, as it were, for quite some time.  There are many functions of a technological university that are not listed or emphasised.

The principle of academic freedom is a defining characteristic of high-quality higher education and research across the world.  The Bill rightly ensures academic freedom will apply in technological universities in the same manner as it applies in universities.  However, it is understood internationally that academic freedom applies to the academic staff of higher education institutions.  Both this and the Universities Act 1997 reflect that understanding.  Extending academic freedom to students would put technological universities in a different position from their peers, both within the State and internationally.  It is believed this would not be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the whole doctrine of academic freedom is based on protecting the security of employment of academics&rsquo; tenure.  As students are not employees, their time in a higher education institution is, by definition, limited.  There are appropriate policies in place in institutions to protect students.  There are separate policies and procedures which govern students&rsquo; rights to expression and to offer them protection in this regard.  This includes the right of free expression.  Any claim that this right is being restricted or the fear that voicing a contrarian opinion would invite academic retribution can be better challenged through the existing charters and policies which set out a detailed process for consideration and redress where necessary.  Such policies and processes have already been agreed with student representatives at local level and have been adopted formally by each of the academic councils.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 54 relates to the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff of a technological university.  This is drafted in accordance with similar provisions which apply to universities, institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology under the relevant legislation.  It provides that a technological university may suspend or dismiss a member of staff only in accordance with procedures established, following consultation with the relevant trade unions and staff associations.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of amendments Nos. 151 and 152 is to mirror the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2014 and the Roads Act 2015, which relate to the terms and conditions of service of staff members.  This wording was sought and agreed with the trade unions and stakeholders during the consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#M02000","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's response.

The Minister of State may be able to reassure us that all of this is accounted for but it is a newer and concerning development in the context of third level institutions.

I have raised some of the points relating to this matter previously.  The word \"community\" is in there somewhere as well.  The point is that the plans of the technological university, TU, to provide programmes of education and training should meet the needs of citizens - Deputy Burton made a fair point about that word - business, enterprise and the professions.  I am a member of a profession.  Where do the arts and culture, particularly courses not of a business, enterprise or professional nature, fit in?<\/p>  <p>  I will not press my amendment because it includes a flaw but I will speak on it.  In the amendment, I have added in the plans of the TU \"to retain, maintain and develop the existing campuses of its applicant institutes including but not limited to its existing programmes of education, training and research\".  I have not taken account of campuses that may well be closing in the city of Dublin but I want to ensure that there is some protection for Blanchardstown, Tallaght and the regional institutions.  This is my party's main point.<\/p>  <p>  In this amendment, I am probably too restrictive in the context of the programmes relating to education, training and research.  <\/p>  <p>               I do not want to legislate to retain an exact range of courses as universities should have the academic freedom to provide the courses it wants to provide.  Can the Minister of State assure us that if an institution becomes a TU, a multidisciplinary range of courses will be available?  Can she assure us that institutions such as that in Blanchardstown will not turn into a specialised college for a specialised subject but will be similar to now, with a range of courses provided to meet the needs of the community in the surrounding area?<\/p> <p> Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 64, to which I will return on Report Stage, concerns what we want to be included in the strategic plan.  It is proposed that the plans of the TU will ensure the geographic names of its various campuses are maintained in its nomenclature relating to each campus.  This means the Blanchardstown institution will be called the TU for Dublin at Blanchardstown, with the other the TU for Dublin at Tallaght, similar the TUs in Tralee or Cork.  This is the case for the various campuses of the University of Ulster.  Deputy Lahart raised the issue in respect of Tallaght and pointed out that some people want it to be called TU Tallaght.  That is not going to happen because it is going to be part of one body.  The name \"Tallaght\" should be retained somewhere, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017111500002#T02200","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":883,"content":"<p>TU4Dublin is committed to fully-serviced campuses.

This is a subject of major importance to Ireland today and it is timely that I am making this presentation on the same day as the Government is launching the citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments and his support for the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and assure the members that the IFA will not be found wanting in spreading the message.  I am joined by our director general, Mr. Damien McDonald and our Oireachtas liaison officer Ms Elaine Farrell, who is well known to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The UK decision to leave the EU will impact hugely on Ireland.  It is timely, therefore, to take stock of what the EU project now stands for and what direction it should take.  Of all of the sectors in society, farmers are those who are most aware of the benefits that EU membership has brought.  For Irish farmers, EU membership has meant access to a market of 500 million consumers, the stability provided by CAP payments and the ability to grow and diversify our export markets.<\/p> <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy was provided for in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and its objectives were set out in that treaty.  These are to increase agricultural productivity, to ensure a fair standard of living for farmers, to stabilise markets, to ensure the availability of supplies, and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  These principles remain equally relevant today.<\/p> <p>  Financial solidarity was a key principle of the new CAP, with spending on the CAP to be borne by the central European budget.  The CAP is of vital importance for producers and provides European consumers with a plentiful supply of high quality, sustainable food produced at affordable prices.  There is now recognition for the multiple roles of farmers as food, fuel and energy producers in addition to meeting environmental requirements and other public goods.  Over the years, it has undergone significant reforms, responding to the demands of European society and consumers.  The current two-pillar structure of the CAP addresses complementary but differing needs.  The role of the basic payment and market support measures in Pillar 1 is to support farm incomes and the delivery of public goods.  The main focus of the rural development programme under Pillar 2 is on farm-based, economic, environmental and social programmes delivered at member state and regional level.<\/p> <p>  The next CAP reform will take place in the context of new challenges facing Europe, including market volatility, climate change, and the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs.  Farmers are committed to delivering on the public good requirements relating to the environment and climate change.  This is in addition to the delivery of quality food and meeting the highest regulatory standards in the areas of food safety and animal health and welfare.  In return, farmers must be provided with a fair standard of living.  Low farm incomes in many sectors continue to provide a challenge to the sustainability of farming enterprises across the EU, and to attracting new entrants into farming.  Simplification of the CAP is also critical.  The reform of the CAP over many decades has led to a serious increase in the regulatory burden on farm enterprises.  The EU is blamed for the bureaucracy and red tape associated with the CAP.  The rules of the payment system and inspection regime must take into account the realities of farming, and the increased use of technology and risk-based analysis must be progressed.  The IFA believes that the EU should set as a target in the next CAP reform the delivery of a strong, sustainable and competitive agriculture for the benefit of farmers and consumers alike.<\/p><p>This requires a strongly funded CAP budget, reversing the cuts imposed in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the period 2014 to 2020, through direct income support and market management measures in pillar 1, and co-financed farm schemes in pillar 2. <br\/><br\/>In the Commission's White Paper on the future of Europe, published last March, a number of potential scenarios for the development of the EU project are outlined, and their potential impact on key policy areas are summarised.  From a farming perspective, the IFA believes that continuing the completion of the Single Market remains very important.  Now, more than ever, free access to and regulatory coherence within the EU market is very important.  However, this should not be the sole focus of the future EU.  In addition, strengthening existing common policies, such as the CAP, is critical to securing a strong future for the EU, and in demonstrating to citizens the positives of EU membership.  The Commission's June reflection paper on the future of the EU finances identifies that the CAP reaches farmers and citizens even in the most marginal areas of the EU, having a positive impact on economic and social development in those areas.  It further suggests that improvement to the policy can arise from putting more emphasis on incentivising farmers to deliver environmental and climate public goods and services.  The IFA is very concerned, however, that in four of the five scenarios outlined for the future EU budget in the paper, a reduction to the CAP budget, either as a percentage of the overall EU budget, or a direct cut, is envisaged. <br\/><br\/>The IFA recognises the challenges facing the EU budget, including the withdrawal of the UK, a net contributor, from the EU, and the need to finance new priorities.  It is unacceptable, however, that existing budget programmes, such as those associated with the CAP and cohesion funding, would be simply reduced to accommodate new challenges.  The IFA believes that member states should increase their contributions, if necessary, to take account of Brexit, to fund existing policies, such as CAP and cohesion policies, and to take on new priorities, where agreed between member states.<br\/><br\/>The last MFF was agreed against a backdrop of economic downturn in the European Union, with direct cuts to the CAP budget.  Since then, there has been a significant recovery for the EU economy.  The IFA believes the future CAP budget should be linked to the growth of the EU economy, which would enable increases in funding.<br\/><br\/>Let me refer to a couple of the other issues that arise.  Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agrifood sector since we joined the EU.  With 40% of our food exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector is as exposed in these negotiations.  The outcome of the Brexit discussions, and the impact on different member states and sectors, is very much linked with the discussion on the future of Europe.  The IFA has set as key priorities for the agriculture sector in these negotiations the maintenance of the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and EU, while preserving the value of the UK market, and the provision of a strong CAP budget following the UK's departure.  The optimum outcome is that the UK remains within the customs union and the Single Market.  This would address both trade and border issues.  The next best option is that we have a comprehensive free-trade agreement between the EU and UK with tariff-free trade for agricultural products and food; the maintenance of equivalent standards on food safety, animal health, welfare and the environment; and the application of a common external tariff for food imports to both the EU and the UK.<br\/><br\/>On EU trade policy, within the EU there must be greater coherence between the CAP and EU trade policy.  It is essential that the correct balance be found between the opening new markets, availing of trade opportunities and protecting sensitive sectors. <b><\/b>The value of the EU market cannot be undermined by increases in low-cost food imports that do not meet the high food-safety, animal welfare, health and environmental standards that are required of EU producers.  Mercosur is a case in point. The EU seems hell-bent on securing a Mercosur deal regardless of the costs to agriculture and the impact on rural areas.<b><\/b>In recent weeks, the EU have already offered an additional 70,000 tonnes of beef quota to Mercosur countries, and this comes on top of preferential market access they already have, representing 246,000 tonnes.  There is already talk of more.<b><\/b>We know from the Brazilian weak flesh fraud those concerned fail to meet EU standards on all of the key issues of traceability, food safety and the environment.<b><\/b>Indeed, the latest EU report from the Food and Veterinary Office states the Brazilian competent authority is not in a position to guarantee that the relevant export requirements are met.<i><\/i>In addition, the report states the competent authorities are signing export report certificates despite being unable to ascertain the veracity of certain statements therein.<b><\/b>In Ireland, the sector is based on meeting the highest standards and environmentally sustainable grassland production systems.<b><\/b>Irish beef production systems are between two and four times more efficient than South American production in terms of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.  It is well established that the growth in South American beef exports, particularly exports from Brazil, has come about on the back of widespread destruction of the rainforest in the Pantanal and Amazon regions.  It would be a total contradiction of EU policy on climate change for Europe to agree a Mercosur deal that replaces sustainable EU beef production for European consumers with product from South America, which has a much higher carbon footprint.<br\/><br\/>On top of all of these issues, we have Brexit.  Half our beef exports go to the UK market.  Therefore, Mercosur negotiations at this time make no sense whatsoever.  I would go so far as to say they are reckless.  We are requesting that our Taoiseach and Minister redouble their efforts in opposition to Mercosur in defence of our key beef sector. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In the area of climate change, while I am concerned by retired professor Alan Matthews's proposal to the Citizens' Assembly to introduce a further &euro;30 million trade-distorting carbon tax on the sector, I am reassured by the perspective of An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that Ireland's focus on cutting emissions should be on energy and transport, given that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 130% since 1990, at a time when emissions from the agriculture sector have declined by almost 6%, despite our output increasing by more than 40%.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the European focus of today, I am extremely concerned about the impact on the future sustainable development of Ireland's agrifood sector arising from positions taken by our Members of the European Parliament regarding the Commission's 2030 climate proposals.  Their position fails to recognise the October 2014 European Council decision that recognises that agriculture has multiple roles and that food production must not be threatened when addressing the climate challenge.  Of specific concern are the amendments to change the 2030 starting point from the average of 2016, 2017 and 2018 to 2020 and the reduction in the LULUCF allowances.  These will impact most on Ireland and will lead to an additional liability of more than &euro;1 billion.  The strong position taken by Government, particularly the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, is welcome in the ongoing discussions.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is taking a leading position in Europe by targeting European funding, through the CAP, at measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.<\/p><p>Some 87% of the measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme have climate reducing elements.  Irish farmers participate in carbon monitoring, measuring and management through programmes such as Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green programme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s beef data and genomics programme and the green low carbon agriculture scheme, GLAS.  All of these schemes promotes the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices.  Farmers will continue to build on our sustainable model of food production and to seek to make improvements in carbon efficiency right across the food supply chain. <\/p><p> One of the initiatives in place is the IFA-led smart farming programme, run in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Smart farming is farmer-led and focuses on demonstrating win-win situations that improve farm incomes, enhance the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to input into the discussions on the future of Europe.  The coming months will be very important in the context of expected initial proposals on the multi-annual financial framework post 2020, and the further development of the Commission position on the reform of the CAP.  It is critically important that the Government, led by the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as Commissioner Hogan at EU level, make the strongest case for a fully-funded CAP post 2020.  Irish farmers remain strongly positive towards the European Union, recognising the benefits that EU membership and the CAP have delivered.  I hope that the outcomes of these discussions can deliver practical changes and contribute to delivering a stronger and better Europe for all its citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for his broad overview.

Mr. Healy, his predecessors and the staff who work in the IFA are very helpful to us as politicians at all times.  The back-up, assistance, networking and general support that it gives to our farming community, in good times and in bad, is second to none.

It speaks before us regularly and gave a very strong presentation to the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union hearings earlier in the year.  Despite my accent there are 63 members of the IFA living in my constituency.  While it is not perhaps a big issue for many of my constituents as other people around this table there are a few key issues in which a few of us Dubs have an interest.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the witness on his re-election.  It was a mighty contest and it is a reflection on the work he has been doing in recent years. <\/p> <p>  On the wider area of new alliances for Ireland in Europe in the future, one of our strongest alliances, when it comes to the CAP, is with France.  The witness raised a number of concerns about Mercosur.  I understand and share those concerns.  In a previous life, in the trade portfolio, I covered the regions in the committee.  It was easier then because we were talking about the trade deal with Japan, but there were issues with the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  However, Mercosur presents a different level of challenge to Ireland specifically that our colleagues in Europe may not feel to the same extent.  TTIP and CETA raised challenges for trade movement in Germany and that challenge was far more pronounced than it was here.  What are the alliances for the IFA in terms of other farm organisations across Europe, and how is it working to build agreement?  When it comes to the CAP and agricultural policy in general does, Mr. Healy agree that France remains our strongest ally?  How do we retain that alliance?  As the current French President is a Europhile, perhaps it will be easier but it will be more difficult as one sees the rise of the hard left and the protectionist nature of Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon and others within France.<\/p> <p> I want to ask about the IFA's role in the conversation on all European issues in the future.  Mr. Healy's statement that \"Irish farmers remain strongly positive towards the European Union, recognising the benefits that EU membership and the CAP have delivered\" is key.  I appreciate the strong role that the IFA has played, especially in recent months, in terms of preparing their members and Irish society at large for the fallout from Brexit.  There have been rare occasions where I would argue that the IFA's contribution to the pro-European movement in Ireland has been lacking.  I am thinking of the first Lisbon treaty, when it entered the debate at a very late stage and was not enthusiastic in its support.  The vacuum created allowed many of the misinformed eurosceptic organisations to take a hold and take root in certain rural communities, which ultimately led to the fall of that referendum.  When the referendum was run a second time, as well as with the one on the fiscal stability treaty, we saw the IFA throw their resources behind it.  I fear greatly, however, that in the future, that calculated risk could be taken again.  I am not talking as someone who is looking for constant balanced argument.  I am talking strongly as a really pro-European politician.  I believe Europe is the key to the future of our agrifood sector.  We were at the launch of a future of Europe discussion this morning.  There has been a 90-fold increase in trade for Ireland since we joined the EEC in 1973.  Much of that trade has been in the agrifood sector.  While the challenges of Brexit will be massive for the agrifood industry - particularly for certain things such as cheddar cheese - we will still rely on our next nearest market beyond the UK being the EU.  While there is huge potential in south-east Asia in particular for certain sectors, and indeed Australia, but ultimately our greatest level of partnership will be on the Continent.  I make my next point as a comment, not a challenge.  As we go forward into this highly challenging post-Brexit era, where the Government and Irish civic society will be committed to having good relations with the UK but to staying in and being at the heart of the EU, where our future lies, we really need to see the IFA and other similar organisations maintain that commitment.  I do not want to take away from what Mr. Healy said.  I was heartened to hear it but I want to put on record that we need to see that commitment constantly in the future.  I am all for constructive criticism where needs be but I warn against the occasional calculated risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#E00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>As I represent an urban constituency in Dublin Bay North, agricultural issues do not arise very often.  That said, I appreciate the important role that agriculture plays in the national economy.  Mr. Healy pointed out that 40% of our food exports go to the UK, and that makes Brexit a great challenge for all of us.<\/p> <p>  If my questions appear very basic it is because I am not involved in the day-to-day detail of agricultural policy.  From where does the threat to CAP arise?  Mr. Healy made the point strongly that we should be committed to a fully-funded CAP post 2020.  All of us will agree with that, it is in our national interest and the joint committee should include the country's strong commitment to the CAP process as a nation state in our final report.<\/p><p>Is it purely a budgetary issue from the point of view of the European Union as a whole or is it maybe something to do with increased urbanisation?  Where do the farmers see the threat to CAP coming from?  Mr. Healy mentioned that most of the scenarios put forward by the European Commission envisage the CAP being reduced in some way or other.<\/p><p> On a separate but maybe related issue, do the witnesses have statistics for the consumption of beef and meat generally?  There seems to be a movement in urban areas to say that meat is bad for one.  Perhaps it has to do with climate change, I am not sure, or maybe it is a health issue too and young people in particular are becoming vegetarian.  Is that of concern to the IFA and farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#E00400","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>I cannot let the opportunity go by to remind everybody that the Deputy's late father, God be good to him, sold an awful lot of beef for us at a critical time when nobody else was capable of doing it.

He is right when he speaks about France.  The IFA is aligned throughout Europe because it is part of COPA, the European umbrella body for farm organisations.  We are the only Irish organisation associated with it.  I had a meeting with it last week in Brussels and will meet it again at the end of the month.  We are constantly in touch with our fellow organisations throughout Europe.  We have a very strong relationship with the French because we think alike on many issues and CAP is one of them.  We deal with farm organisations across Europe, whether in Denmark or Belgium, or wherever.  I am vice president of COPA.  The president is a German who comes from the same region as the Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources, Mr. Oettinger.  He came to speak at one of our recent meetings.  Having those alliances and constantly building them is very important for the IFA.  We not only meet at the meetings but we often meet for bilaterals too.  It is crucial to have that.  There is no point in our organisation looking for an extension to, for example, the glyphosate licence or an increase in the CAP budget on our own.  We have to be sure we have support.<\/p> <p>  I would take issue with the comment that the IFA was lacking in the past.  The one time we were lacking and got our backs behind it, the vote was carried and rural Ireland did support it.  That proved how crucial the organisation is.  <\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the main threat to the future funding of CAP comes from the exit of the UK.  It is a net contributor to CAP to the tune of &euro;3 billion.  It gives &euro;10 billion to the EU budget, &euro;6 billion of that goes to CAP, &euro;3 billion of which goes to UK farmers.  If we take &euro;3 billion out of the total CAP budget of between &euro;56 billion and &euro;58 billion, that is a sizeable 5% to 6% drop.  There is also the question of the new EU initiatives being discussed, to do with security or defence.  Our argument is that for any new priorities there must be new money.<\/p> <p>  Maybe our organisations and politicians have failed over the years to get across the benefit of CAP.  People see it as a benefit to farmers across Europe.  CAP has benefited the 500 million European consumers very significantly.  When it was introduced in the early 1960s, 30% of the average household income was being spent on food.  Today, for better quality food that is more traceable and produced to a much higher standard, only between 10% and 12% of the average household income is spent on food.  CAP has allowed an adequate supply of safe, traceable, quality food to be produced at very affordable prices.  Those are the threats. <\/p> <p>  To answer the second part of the question about beef, Europe is already 102% self-sufficient in beef supply.  When the UK leaves it will be 116% self-sufficient in beef.  The European consumption of beef is dropping year on year, for various reasons maybe because well-known models or sports stars advertise on social media against it without any scientific backup &ndash; that is possible nowadays on social media.  That is why I say talk of a Mercosur deal is reckless, based on consumption dropping, an oversupply already and that oversupply getting worse, going from 102% to 116% in a couple of years' time when the UK leaves the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510758000,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I will just echo some of the comments made by Mr. Healy.  The IFA has always been a staunchly European organisation.  We supported the European Union and that remains the association's position.  As most members of the committee know, however, there are frustrations with the European Union among farmers.  It is important that they are not forgotten.  The president has already outlined the situation in respect of Mercosur and the potential implications of Brexit and how the EU will respond to that.  Commissioner Hogan has talked a lot about the simplification of the CAP.  While it is critical, it has frustrated some farmers by bringing in a lot of red tape and bureaucracy, some of it perceived as unnecessary.  A move to simplify it and make it easier for the participants would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  Farmers are frustrated.  There is the upcoming vote on glyphosate where the European scientific agencies are giving the green light to this product yet the political system is not responding to that.  A decision has not yet been arrived at.  It did not get through for ten years.  A five-year approval was not passed.  It is down to four years now and will go to appeal.  That causes frustration for farmers as European citizens who say if we are not basing what we do on science where does that leave us.  It raises questions such as if the European Union prohibits certain products, and there are plenty of those already, it does not seem to apply the same standards to products which are imported which can be used although they contain some products that are banned in the EU.  It places them at a competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>  The IFA, like any association, is a democracy and I would not be aware of the background to the Lisbon treaty but it is important that Irish citizens' support, farmers included, for the EU, which has generally been very strong, is not taken for granted.  That is a message the EU has to take on board.  Our position has always been that we negotiate as an EU 27 and back the European position.  We met Michel Barnier and we are very much part of that process.<\/p><p>However, if farmers are faced with a scenario where we have Brexit and the UK goes off and does its own thing and then we find the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, being eroded, our markets being eroded because agriculture becomes a sacrificial lamb in a trade deal with Mercosur, that is not a way to keep European citizens behind the EU project.  It is important that the European Union delivers for farmers and all citizens if it is to continue to keep its support.  The President made a point about Mercosur and the carbon impact of beef coming from Brazil versus the carbon impact of beef in Ireland.  It can be two or four times the land use changes involved because a lot of rain forests are being felled in Brazil to turn them into pasture land.  However, there are, at any point in time over the past number of years, between 6 and 7 million cattle in Ireland.  There are 226 million cattle in Brazil.  That is the scale and one can see how frustrated Irish farmers are when they see the emphasis being placed on methane output from 1 million cattle and the European Union going to facilitate a much less carbon-efficient beef production coming into the European Union from one country.  There are 53 million more cattle in Argentina.  The policies and decisions that the European Union makes have to make sense to farmers and the citizens.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Can I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510758000,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>To add to what Mr. McDonald said, and this is in the presentation, we as farmers in Ireland and across Europe see the bureaucracy, the red tape, the standards, the traceability that we have to have in order to qualify for various payments, in order to qualify to get our cattle killed and in order to qualify to farm.

I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officer in the older people&rsquo;s projects unit, and Dr. Jean Long from the Health Research Board.<\/p> <p>  Improving home care services so that people can live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible is a key commitment of Government.  Home supports are crucial to helping older people and, indeed, people of all ages with particular care needs to remain where they want to be, namely, at home in the surroundings with which they are most familiar and comfortable.<\/p><p> This is an opportune time to meet with the committee because the Department has commenced work on designing a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care.  I look forward to hearing the views of the committee as well as the perspectives of the other speakers here today.  Before I speak about plans for the future, it is important to first consider where we are at the moment. <\/p><p> I will mention rights and eligibility for home care services first.  At present, home care services are provided through the HSE on the basis of assessed health care need and no personal contribution towards the cost is required.  The HSE provides services both directly and through service level agreements with private and voluntary sector providers.  The current system relies heavily on family carers, who play a crucial role in helping older people and others that need help to remain living in their own homes for longer.  These carers not only make a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of those that they care for, but also make an important and often unacknowledged contribution to the economy.  This is reflected in the 2016 census results published earlier this month, which identified that about 195,000 carers are providing a minimum of 6.6 hours of care per week.    <\/p><p> I will now consider resources.  The HSE will spend approximately &euro;370 million on home care in 2017, out of a total budget of &euro;765 million for services for older people.  This figure excludes funding for the nursing homes support scheme.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan provides for a target of just over 10.5 million home help hours; almost 17,000 home care packages; and 190 intensive home care packages, co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, for clients with complex needs, particularly those living with dementia. <\/p><p> In budget 2018 a further &euro;37 million has been made available to further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.  A significant proportion of this additional funding will go towards home care services.  The resources available for home care services, while significant, are limited, and with the increase in our elderly population, demand is growing year-on-year.  Accordingly, the services and allocation of resources to individual clients, require prudent management on an ongoing basis as demands for services increase.  In this context, those clients who are assessed and approved for home care, and who are not being provided immediately with a service, are risk-assessed and placed on a waiting list for a resource as it becomes available.  It is important to note that many people also purchase home care services directly from private providers.<\/p><p> I will now address regulation.  Home care services are among the health and social care services for which there is currently no statutory regulation.  However, the HSE is progressing a range of measures to improve home care provision overall, to standardise services nationally, and to promote quality and safety.  This includes a national procurement framework for home care services, which came into effect in 2012 and was put out to tender again in 2016.  This provides a mechanism for quality assurance.  Providers are also monitored through service level agreements with the HSE.<\/p><p> I will now address the plans for the new statutory home care scheme.  While the existing home care service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it is recognised that home care services need to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The Department is of the view that a stand-alone funding scheme designed specifically for home care is needed, together with an effective system of regulation.  In 2016 the Department&rsquo;s intention to bring forward legislative proposals for the regulation of home care was indicated in a report entitled Better Health, Improving Healthcare.  The programme for a partnership Government signalled the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the introduction of a uniform home care service.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, Deputy Helen McEntee played a key role in advancing this undertaking, tasking the Department with the development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care.<\/p><p> The new scheme will improve access to home care in an affordable and sustainable way.  It will provide transparency around service allocation and individuals&rsquo; eligibility for services, and ensure that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner across the country.  The scheme will also result in more effective integration with other health supports including nursing, therapies, and other primary care services.  A system of regulation will be designed to ensure public confidence in the standard of the services provided, and to bring Ireland in line with best international practice.  It will be important to get the balance right in this regard and to ensure that the system of regulation is effective and not overly bureaucratic.<\/p><p> I will now speak about progress to date.  As an initial step in developing the new system, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board, HRB, to undertake a review of the home care systems in place in four European countries.  The review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience.  The committee will shortly be hearing from Jean Long of the Health Research Board, who will speak in more detail about the findings of this review.<\/p><p> The Department also launched a public consultation process on the financing and regulation of home care in July of this year.  Over 2,600 responses to this phase of the consultation process were received.  The purpose of this public consultation was to enable us to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home care provision.  Preliminary analysis of the submissions has been undertaken, and we would be happy to share details of some of the initial findings this morning if that would be of assistance to the committee.  A full report on the findings of the consultation will be published early next year.  This will inform the Department&rsquo;s development of the new funding scheme and regulatory arrangements.<\/p><p> The process for determining the type of home care scheme and approach to regulation that is best for Ireland is complex.  A significant amount of analysis is needed to develop policy proposals on the form of the home care scheme and the system of regulation that will apply to these services.  It is important that we get this right and take the time required to ensure that these measures will be successful, affordable and sustainable.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us to present here this morning, and I look forward to continuing engagement throughout the process of developing the new home care scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to make a presentation of our findings.  On behalf of the Department of Health, the HRB commissioned an evidence review titled Approaches to Regulation and Financing of Home Care Services in Four European Countries.  The countries examined were Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Scotland.  It was published in April 2017 and covered two topics.<\/p> <p>  The first topic was the regulation of formal home care services.  All four countries have explicit national legislation and policy covering formal home care services.  The national government controls the vision for home care, but regional governments oversee the selection of home care services that will be publicly funded.  Support to keep people living in their own homes is the main principle underpinning home care policy in all four countries.  There is a long tradition of regulated formal home care in the Netherlands and Scotland, whereas regulated formal home care was introduced later in Sweden and Germany.<\/p> <p>  Excepting Sweden, three of the four countries have national a set of quality standards for home care services that are guided by legislative acts.  In addition, the three countries have an independent inspectorate to assess quality standards.  Quality standards have been determined by the regulator with input from patient representatives in Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland.  To achieve accreditation, home care service providers in Germany and the Netherlands are expected to operate using an in-house quality management system, and are also responsible for ensuring that staff are properly qualified and suitably remunerated.  Annual quality audits are carried out by external bodies in Germany and the Netherlands, and accreditation is awarded if the audit results meet the standards.  Scotland operates a national annual compulsory registration scheme, and registration is determined on the basis of meeting basic standard requirements.  Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland have common national minimum training criteria for home care workers. <\/p> <p>  In Germany and Scotland, random inspections are carried out on home care providers annually to ensure standards are adhered to.  In addition, specific complaints are investigated separately.  The Netherlands monitors home care services via annual surveys, and inspections are only carried out in response to specific complaints.<\/p><p>In Sweden, regular inspections, surveys and responses to specific complaints are completed.  Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden publish results of home care service quality inspections on publicly accessible websites.  Germany, the Netherlands, and Scotland operate sanctions if quality standards are not adhered to.  In each country, regulatory bodies are or appear to be partly funded through contributions made by long-term care insurances, or by registration fees paid by care providers. <\/p><p> On approaches to assessing and financing home care services, need rather than the ability to pay for home care services is an underlying principle of formal home care provision in all four countries.  Germany and the Netherlands have long-established long-term care insurance schemes which facilitated the provision of formal home care services and these have recently been subject to reforms, which included revised needs assessments and eligibility entitlements alongside the introduction of increased or additional co-payments.  Scotland and Sweden have a long-standing rights-oriented home care services sector funded through taxation, which are increasingly being rationed by stricter eligibility criteria and the introduction of fixed fee services and co-payments. <\/p><p> All four countries have formal needs assessment which contain documented eligibility criteria that allows a fair and comparative assessment as to the need for formal home care and the level of requirements.  All four countries encourage some level of informal care by close relatives to help fill the home care requirement.  All four countries have an element of user choice as to how services are provided to address formal home care requirements, with services typically offered in kind or via personal budgets.  The basket of formal home care services in the four countries include personal care and help with household tasks.  Nursing care is included in the basket of services in Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland and is provided through a separate assessment process in Sweden.<\/p><p> Generally, the literature on the four countries reported that the supply of formal home care could meet the demand, but their actions indicate that countries have taken interventions to either restrict formal home care supply or fund additional demand.  For example, Germany has increased the long-term insurance premium for childless people, increased co-payments to 30% of the total formal home care costs, tightened the criteria for how much home care people can receive, and expects families to provide informal care where the formal care service cannot meet the demand.  The Netherlands has waiting lists and has reduced its needs-based service allocation by tightening access criteria.  Scotland has increased the budget allocated to home care and asked citizens who earn over &pound;16,000 to pay for household tasks.  Sweden has also tightened criteria entitling its citizens to home care.  Small co-payments are required for all services in Sweden.  Tax free credits are available to taxpayers who buy private home care for their elderly relatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jean Long","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>We will take questions in groups of three so I ask the witnesses to take note of them.

Their studies have been very comprehensive.  I have concern based on looking at how we legislate here.  I mentioned it earlier but in 2012 I produced a Private Members' Bill in 2012 on professional indemnity insurance for medical practitioners, Senator James Reilly had brought in a Private Members Bill when he was a Deputy in 2009, and it is only this morning that a regulation finally went through to make it compulsory for all medical practitioners to have professional indemnity insurance.  That is a seven or eight year time period from when the legislation is discussed to it being put through.  The fair deal scheme was similar.  Problems arose in 2004 on nursing homes and it was 2009 before the fair deal scheme was set up.  I published a Private Members' Bill on home care regulation on foot of the Law Reform Commission report which was also a comprehensive report.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing new regulation and new legislation and we are talking about the initial stages.  How advanced is the Department on new regulation and legislation?  If we start the process of bringing forward draft proposals, whether by regulation or legislation, what timescale are we be talking about?  If it is legislation, when are we likely to see the heads of a Bill on this?  The Law Reform Commission has done considerable work on this area and I am interested in what kind of legislation it has proposed.  I understand that the companies which provide home care have a code and this works reasonably well but there is no legislation governing who can provide home care.  What timescale are we talking about?  To be fair to the two witnesses here and the Departmental officials, much work has been done but we question is now about taking decisive action in view of there being huge growth in the numbers of people over 65 years between now and 2030.  My concern is that it is currently 637,000 and will be over a million by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#F01100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Spillane and Dr. Long for their presentations.  It is a real indication of how seriously the Department is taking home care.  The witnesses rightly commended the Minister of State, Deputy Helen MacEntee, for her leadership on this, and she has passed the baton to Deputy Jim Daly who I am confident will progress this with the same rigour and enthusiasm.  I have two general points.  First, it is the clear preference of people themselves, older people, those with dementia who may be under 65 years, to live at home in their own communities for as long as possible.  That preference for home care needs to be at the heart of the Department's deliberations.  It is an obvious point but it is one that can be missed.  Last year Age Action Ireland, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and UCD were involved in a report which is a very good source document which can be consulted, there is no need to do it again.  We have loads of consultations and have done all that, and got a huge response.  It is the wish among individuals and we are talking about ourselves.  We are all living longer.  It is not an abstract point, but an enlightened self-interest in getting this right.<\/p> <p>  Second, and this is something Ms Spillane mentioned, is the position with regard to the 195,000 carers.  With support from the State, in partnership, they can continue to do the work they want to.  They will not down tools when a home care system is brought in.<\/p><p>They want to be involved but they do not want to be carrying the burden by themselves.  They are urgently awaiting this scheme.  I accept that progress is being made, but we cannot let deadlines slip.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that 4,000 of these 195,000 carers are under 15 years of age and almost 2,000 are over 85 years of age, an increase in the latter of 35% according to the census.  The will and preference of individuals and the strain on carers must be front and centre.  <br\/><br\/>Ms Spillane mentioned that &euro;370 million is being spent on home care.  It would be helpful if she would compare that spend with what is being spent on residential care.  What budget is being allocated for home care in 2018 relative to 2017, in respect not only of older people but home care specifically and what money is being set aside for dementia-specific home care, which is a very particular form of home care in terms of the manner in which it needs to be provided?  Consistency and duration of care in this area is critical.  One cannot hurry people with dementia.  <br\/><br\/>Like Senator Burke I would welcome more information about the proposed regulatory system, including when it will come into force.  There is currently no entitlement <i>per se<\/i>to home care such as applies in respect of residential care.  Resources are limited and there is no statutory regulation and as such there is an urgency in this area.  During statements in the Seanad on the fair deal scheme, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, promised that the consultation on home care would be completed by the end of this year.  We are now told it will not be completed until early in the new year.  I am concerned about slippage in this regard because as I said the 195,000 carers and those for whom they care cannot wait.  <br\/><br\/>My next question is to Dr. Long.  In the four countries which she studied there are systems of regulation and funding regimes.  Is it true to say that we are lagging behind significantly in terms of a proper system of home care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#F01200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I remind members and witnesses to ensure their mobile phones are switched off as they cause interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>My apologies for leaving the meeting for a short time but I had to make a number of emergency calls.  I agree with the comments of the last speaker in regard to home care.  I have a couple of questions for the witnesses.  In regard to the private providers, how is that system working?  Has it been assessed in terms of operation, efficiency and cost?  Is it cost-effective?  I recognise that it is better for provision to be made in this way rather than for the system to take it on board but I would like to know whether it is effective, cost effective and efficient.  By \"effective\" I mean effective to the person receiving the care.<\/p> <p>  This is a cross-departmental issue.  I note that in recent times there have been a number of refusals of carer's allowance to people who would appear to me to be eligible.  Some people are reluctant to have strangers in their home.  They have a built-in resistance to it, which I can understand.  It is important that in situations where family members take time off work to care for an elderly or sick relative they are paid for doing so by the relevant Department.  I am doing all I can to ensure this is done.  In the case of dementia, it is not possible to dismiss a person's need based on appearance and so on.  These cases are not easy to deal with because those concerned require care, attention and constant supervision.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to regulation, is Ms Spillane satisfied with the extent to which the regulations are likely to be applied throughout the system, particularly in terms of contracted carers?  The current system is welcome in that households are now visited a number of times throughout the day by different carers as opposed to the previous system whereby a single carer was assigned to a particular household for a number of years, often to the detriment of his or her own health and thus leading him or her to also needing care.  We need to be conscious of the carer in the household nearing the situation where he or she will also need help and assistance.<\/p> <p>  To what extent will the care in the home scheme be extended by way of the existing carer in the home and the contracted carer system?  In other words, how is it proposed to meet demand?  The fair deal scheme is cumbersome, to say the least, and it is unlikely to improve.  What I cannot understand is why at a time of scarcity in terms of residential care beds the HSE is attempting to close down existing units.  Despite the increase in demand, a number of residential beds are being closed or used for purposes other than catering for the additional demand.  I am aware of two public nursing homes where this is happening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>Would Ms Spillane like to respond to the questions thus far?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#G00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke asked how advanced we are in terms of the proposals.

The experience referenced in terms of the fair deal scheme is indicative because there are parallels between the two processes but we intend to do this quicker than was done in respect of the fair deal scheme.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about regulation.  The Department recognises and acknowledges the need for regulation of home care services.  This service is either funded by the HSE or privately.  The new system will help to promote quality and client safety.  In addition, it will ensure that the public can be confident in services and that the services being provided to their relatives and loved ones are of the type they need and are of appropriate quality.  To develop the regulatory system we will be considering the experience of other jurisdictions.  Dr. Long's report will be very helpful in this regard.  We will also be taking into account the expertise in this country.  For example, we will engage with HIQA and we will consider Senator Burke's Bill which builds on the work of the Law Reform Commission.  This process will be about learning what we can and adapting.  We cannot pick a system and introduce it in Ireland.  Any system would have to be tailored to the particular requirements we have in this country.<\/p><p>I should mention, however, that while we do not have a statutory scheme of regulation, the Health Service Executive took a significant step towards quality assurance in 2012 when it introduced the single procurement framework for external providers of home care services.  The framework includes quality standards for governance and accountability, person centred care, complaints management and training and qualifications.  Providers are monitored by the HSE through service level agreements and are required to provide a range of information on their services.  It is our intention to build on this good work and place the regulatory system on a statutory footing as quickly as we can. <\/p><p> In terms of a timeline for the development of the regulatory system, it is our intention to make parallel proposals on regulation and the statutory scheme.  The reason both processes will be done in tandem is that we want them to mesh well, as opposed to having them develop in isolation. <\/p><p> It is interesting to note the finding of a recent opinion poll commissioned by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that 76% of respondents mistakenly believed home care services were already being regulated.

We are familiar with the excellent Age Action report to which the Senator referred.  Similarly, when we designed the consultation process we were anxious to hear the views of people who avail of services and we went to great trouble to offer an easy read version of the questionnaire.  The responses received represent a good cross-section of opinion.  As indicated, we can provide members with some details of the survey if they would consider that helpful.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher also referred to the large number of carers who are waiting anxiously for the scheme.  The research done by the Health Research Board makes clear that the formal home care schemes provided in other countries are very much viewed as complementary to family carers.  Ideally, one engages in extensive consultation and takes account of people's views when offering a service to an individual.  We would like to move in that direction and we are examining this issue in the disability sector through the task force on personalised services.  Many of the lessons emerging from the task force's work are relevant to this area also.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher also asked a question on the budget for home care.  The home care budget for 2017 is &euro;373 million compared with &euro;940 million for the nursing homes support scheme.  Funding for the former equates to approximately 40% of funding for the latter.  The Senator also asked how the home care budget for 2017 compared with the budget for 2018.  As I indicated, an additional &euro;37 million is being provided for older people's services.  A significant proportion of this - probably two thirds of the total - will be for home care.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a specific figure on funding for dementia but I can check this for the Senator.  The Department is in discussion with the HSE on the service plan.  If the Senator wishes, we will provide the figure in writing at a later stage.

In terms of private providers, under a longstanding arrangement, there has been a mix between services provided by the HSE voluntary organisations and private companies.  The issue is one of ensuring these three strands mesh well and we will emphasise this in the development of the new scheme.  We cannot have different providers working in isolation.  We need them to work together to improve outcomes for service users and build services around the user, as opposed to the provider of the service.<\/p> <p>  The issue of informal care was raised a number of times.  We fully recognise that informal carers are the backbone of home care provision.  What we need to do is ensure informal carers are appropriately supported to deliver care, which is the reason the issue also arose in the consultation process.  We need to ensure that we get the balance right between family carers and formal carers and that they work effectively together.  This is a complicating factor because we have providers who view the matter from a formal provider perspective.  We need to ensure they also see the perspective of family carers and that we design the system in a way that supports family carers to do what they want to do.  It is clear that people want to support their family members by helping them to stay at home.  However, they need the support and help from services and service providers to do this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also referred to regulation and asked how we would meet demand.  Demand is increasing and there are demographic challenges facing the country.

Are there any plans for more respite to give those family members a break?<\/p> <p>  Respite needs to be made more formal and planned better.  I know many people who have to fight to get respite every time.  They may be going on holidays in June but they are offered the respite in July.  Perhaps under the new scheme there could be a more formal arrangement with regard to respite.<\/p> <p>  At present, home care and the home help hours seem to be for morning and evening only.  It is a one-size-fits-all arrangement.  Informal carers can often manage mornings and evenings themselves but may need help during the middle of the day.

I presume that in some cases more than one person is being cared for in a particular situation.<\/p> <p>  People often talk, rightly, about the amount of money that is saved for the State as a result of the work of unpaid informal carers.  It is also relevant with regard to people receiving carer's allowance when one considers the amount of that allowance compared with what it would cost to provide full-time care in a nursing home or were we to apply the cost on an hour-by-hour caring basis.  A vast amount of money is being saved to the State.  That is not the only point.  The great desire of people to be cared for in their own homes and to live in their own homes for as long as possible is relevant as well.  It is wrong to think of it purely in money terms.  However, it is important that the State would always have in mind the value been given to the State by these people working in the home.  Do the officials have an estimate for the value?  What metric does the Department use?  Given the figure on the number of carers, how does the Department measure the value they give to the State in financial terms?  What is the estimate of that value?  Is the carer's allowance subtracted from the potential cost of full-time nursing home care?  Do we simply look at the difference?  How is it measured?

Every euro invested in home care is money that can be spent on where people want to be for as long as possible, which is in their own homes.  If Scotland spends double what we spend does it mean there is a corresponding increase in the provision of the service or is it that they just provide more hours while having less in the way of informal caring or a lower dependence on carers allowance?  A lot of people get carers allowance but many do not and if those people were to declare a one-day strike, this country would come to a complete standstill.

It is not focused on residential care but on preventing hospital admissions.  Money is being moved from the hospitals to the home care service.  It is about providing more complex care for people.  Big losers in this process, from what we read, were the people who required a small number of hours of home care.  We might not want to follow this.  Those people's hours are being moved to care in cases more typically found in a hospital or nursing home.  We need to be careful not to just do everything everybody else does but to think about what we will do.  We could, by not providing the small number of hours, actually make people's situation worse and increase hospital admissions that we would want to decrease later.

Our mission is to achieve fundamental change in the lives of all older people by eliminating age discrimination, promoting positive ageing and securing their right to comprehensive and high quality services. <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet you this morning and acknowledge the efforts of Minister of State at the Department of Health Deputy Jim Daly, who has responsibility for older people and his predecessor the then Minister of State at the Department of Health<b><\/b>and now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Helen McEntee in bringing forward the public consultation on how we can develop a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services.  I acknowledge and thank the officials from the Department of Health when they referred to the extension of that consultation, which was something that Age Action and a number of other organisations had requested.<br\/><br\/>Goal 3 of the National Positive Ageing Strategy states that it is the policy of the Government to &ldquo;Enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible&rdquo;.  <font color=\"#212100\">Every political party and elected representative we have met have told us they support this.  Yet despite this political will, we have developed a system that drives older people into long-term care prematurely and that treats home care supports more as a way to empty acute hospital beds than to enable an older person to age at home with dignity and independence.<\/font><br\/><br\/>In Ireland, we spend 1% of our total healthcare expenditure on preventative care, significantly less than other European countries.  The current policy of prioritising the provision of home care packages to facilitate discharge from acute hospitals means older people in hospital can access them more easily than those in the community.  This makes it harder for older people in the community to have their care needs met and, as we heard a few moments ago, it is a false economy.  Frail older people who are denied home care have higher rates of admission to acute hospitals, while those who get the support they need see a fall in the number of hospital admissions. <br\/><br\/>The HSE Planning for Health 2017 report calculated that 50,875 people should be in receipt of home help in 2017.  However, as indicated in Table 1 of the submission to members, the number of home help hours provided remained at 2016 levels.  These figures reflect home help provided to all care groups.  A HSE performance report in 2009 estimated that 85% off recipients were older people.  Using this figure, it is estimated that fewer than 42,000 older people receive home help, approximately 6.5% of the population aged 65 and over. <br\/><br\/>When set against the OECD estimate that 10.1 % of people aged 65 and over need home care this suggests approximately 22,000 older people in Ireland are not getting the support they need.  Evidence of this unmet need is apparent in the community.  An evaluation of the piloting of the single assessment tool indicated that of 534 fair deal applicants discharged from acute hospitals, 41%, or 219 patients, were not in receipt of home support services prior to admission.<br\/><br\/>The numbers waiting for home help are increasing.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2016, 2,039 people were assessed as needing home help but waiting for a service.  By the end of April of this year, the number of people who were waiting had increased by more than 20% to 2,456.  As Senator Mullen said earlier, there are major regional disparities within these figures.  A total of 554 people in the community health organisation area 9 were awaiting home help at the end of December 2016, whereas no one was awaiting home help in community health organisation area 7.  People who are waiting for hours to become available can be obliged to wait until a client dies or moves into a nursing home.  A social worker who was interviewed as part of a research study - Meeting Older People&rsquo;s Preference for Care, which was highlighted by Senator Kelleher earlier - confirmed that \"often the situation is that you are waiting for someone to die to access hours\".  The reality is that home help hours and home care packages are simply not available in many parts of the country.  As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony indicated, we repeatedly hear about this issue from Deputies who are dealing with their constituents.  When more older people are forced into nursing homes unnecessarily, families struggle to cope without home helps and more pressure is piled on family carers who are already being put to the pin of their collars.  We welcome the additional home care funding that was announced by the Government in last month&rsquo;s budget.  We look forward to seeing this make a real difference in reducing the number of people who are waiting for services.<\/p><p> A flexible and person-centred approach to the provision of home care services is needed to meet the specific needs of the individual, the carer and the wider health society.  We need a rights-based statutory model for the delivery of home care.  If people are to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as is their right under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, home care must move from a selective model in which services are allocated at the discretion of local management in each community health organisation area to a universal model that is underpinned by rights.  In this context, we expect the State to continue to be the main provider of home help and home care services and to function as the bedrock of the home care system.  While older people should have a choice of providers, it is critical that the State does not seek to abdicate its responsibility for ensuring all public and private providers meet certain minimum standards.  We welcome the comments from the departmental officials earlier today about their commitment to ensuring there is proper regulation of home care.  A statutory entitlement to care allows older people to claim their rights and steers policy and resources towards the State's legal responsibilities.  Home care services underpinned by legislation can address the absence of any rigorous monitoring, regulation or quality standards.  We must change how we think about long-term care.  Long-term care should be recognised as a public good, rather than as an individual responsibility.  As the number of older people in Ireland is set to continue to rise in the coming years, we have an opportunity to put in place a system that provides a continuum of care for our older citizens and integrates home care with primary and community services and, where necessary, nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  We look forward to working with the members of the committee to make all of this a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I invite Professor O'Shea to address the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#N00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I will focus primarily on the economics and financing of long-term care.  The key point I want to make is that regulation and legislation are not enough unless they are accompanied by adequate resources.  In recent years, adequate resources have not been provided in support of the long-term care we need.  This is particularly true in the case of home care.  If we are serious about changing the structure and the system of care, we have to find some way to provide the resources to do that.  We have been really good at policy and the rhetoric of policy.  Our vision for what we want, as set out in reports like the Care of the Aged report from 1966 and the The Years Ahead report from 1977 and in various strategies, including the recent dementia strategy, could not be faulted.  The implementation aspect relating to that could be faulted, however.  I think that is the key to change in the coming years.  The key pressure among the numerous pressures that are coming on the system is demography, which will change the landscape over the next ten or 20 years.  We have been seeing it coming, but it is arriving now.  It will be a key game-changer in the context of the resource question.  This is the fundamental area I want to talk about today.<br\/><br\/>Various countries take differing approaches to the key question of where the locus of responsibility with respect to care should lie.  The Nordic countries, for example, tend to favour large Government spending on the welfare state.  Countries in southern Europe tend to rely on family care.  Where do we lie?  Where is the locus of responsibility in Ireland in the context of care provision?  <i>De facto<\/i>, it is with families.  Families provide the main bulk of care.  When a monetary value is put on the care that is provided in the area of dementia, in which I work, it is found that almost half of the cost of care is borne by families.  <i>De facto<\/i>, care is borne by families.  We do not have much data on preferences.  Some 60% of the 100 members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that families should have primary responsibility in this regard and the State should provide strong supports.  One third of members of the Citizens' Assembly said that the State should bear the primary responsibility for care, with family support.  Interestingly, 87% of members of the Citizens' Assembly agreed that more spending is needed.  Regardless of whether one thinks the State should provide more or families should provide more, there is agreement that not enough is being provided.  <i>De facto<\/i>, carers provide care.<br\/><br\/>I would like to speak about one of the things that have been happening in the home care area in recent years.  This has been going on for a while.  We have not managed to get sufficient resources.  When we have had financial difficulties, the first thing we have done is cut back on community care services.  One of the reasons for this is that community services are easier than other services to cut back, or not increase.  That is what has happened in recent years.  If one divides total expenditure by this country's total population of older people - I am talking about the number of people over the age of 65, rather than the total number of dependent older people - one will find that spending has decreased by approximately &euro;1,000 <i>per capita<\/i>over the past eight years.  I am not saying that all of those over the age of 65 are depending on the State because of course they are not.  The broad figure I have mentioned gives an indication that it is easier to decide not to fund community care services - we sometimes do this unwittingly - than it is to cut back on residential care services because there is a statutory element to services in the latter category.  It is also difficult to cut back in the areas of pay and so on.  We tend not to support fragmented community care services for these reasons.  We need a statutory home care system because it will give people certainty in these respects.<br\/><br\/>One of the enduring criticisms of Government policy in respect of dependent older people is the imbalance between residential care and community-based care.  I am not arguing that we should cut back on residential care, which is needed for some older people.  There is no question of this being a case of one or the other.  We need to give more support to people in community-based care.  At the moment, the balance of care is fragmented and unequal.  I would say there is inequality of home care provision across the country.  One can be lucky or unlucky, depending on where one lives.  It is sometimes more difficult in rural areas.  Similarly, there can be difficulties in the community care systems in urban areas.  The community care systems we have are very narrow.  They tend to focus on home help, which is important and critical, but there are many other things that older people want, which is a question I want to focus on.  At present, we tend to determine community-based care on the basis of what suppliers and health care and social care providers think older people want.  I suggest we need to move towards a personalised care system that responds to the expressed needs and preferences of older people.  Older people and people with dementia have a voice.  They know their own care needs and preferences.  We should be able to respond to them in a very personalised way.  This is not just a question of rights.  The emphasis should not be on home care only.  We need personalised home care.  We need a variety of responses.  The focus should not be solely on the provision of more home help hours, although that is important.  We need to think about psychosocial responses.  We need to think about connecting dependent older people in the communities where they live.  It is not good enough just to provide care.  We must connect.  We make people who are invisible visible in their own communities so that they can live good lives.  This is a critical point in any discussion on the development of home care services.  While expanding rights to community-based care is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one.<\/p><p>We need to think about what kind of services we have.<\/p><p> That brings me to the final point I want to talk about, which is funding.  Funding for long-term care here in Ireland has typically come from general taxation.  There are good reasons we use general taxation to fund care.  General taxation is universal.  It is democratically accountable.  It yields a large amount of money and it tends to be progressive.  However, dependent older people have lost out.  General taxation does not trickle down to where we want those resources for older people.  In particular, it does not trickle down to flexible, responsive, personalised community-based care.  If we simply legislate for more home care and rights, unless we address the funding issue we will not change very much.  That means we could opt to allocate more resources.  I do not mean allocate willy-nilly as one has to evaluate what is good and what is bad in care.  This is not simply a case of allocation for the sack of it.  There are alternatives.  An alternative option which I spoke about probably 20 years ago was discussed ten or 15 years ago.  Some countries, such as Japan and German, use designated social insurance funding for long-term care.  Under a social insurance system, people would pay into a fund and in return would get an automatic entitlement.  I will not go into how one would create that system, but it is a social insurance system.  Such a system would allow for a more protected, and, if we want, designated, visible transparent community-based care system where we could say what we have, what we allocate and what is the impact of that.<\/p><p> When we last discussed this, for example, in the four years between 2002 and 2006 when we were coming up to the fair deal legislation, we as a society felt it would be too costly, it might impact on competitiveness and it might impact on labour markets.  We wondered would it be seen as an additional form of taxation.  I believe there are significant advantages to a social insurance system and it, along with rights-based community-based care, needs to be part of the debate over the coming years.  It works well in Germany and Japan.  If we do not think about changing the structure of funding, we need to ensure that taxation gets allocated and trickles down to where we want it.<\/p><p> I would again say that rights without resources for community-based care will not achieve what we want it to achieve.  Therefore, if we want to develop high-quality services, if we want to shift the balance where the onus of care is primarily on families, we need to think about what we are thinking about now, which is rights, but we need to do more.  We need to think about rights for a rich variety of services for older people.  We need to think about rights for a visible equitable system of care for older people.  We need to shift the balance from residential to community, although keeping strong residential care services, and we need to think about having the older person, the person with dementia, right at the centre of that decision-making process.  Then we would have a credible home care system for an increasing demography that will put considerable pressure over the next ten years on this society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Shea.

The NCCN represents 26 not-for-profit home care providers across the country and as we have submitted a briefing document also, I will focus on a few key points.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for all stakeholders involved in home care provision is how to satisfy and sustain the growing need for the service.  We know that keeping older persons at home has benefits for clients, their families and the State.  Living and being cared for at home gives the older person a sense of independence and dignity and lets him or her remain part of the community.  It is also the least expensive option.<\/p> <p>  Historically, the provision of the home care service by community providers was carried out on an almost voluntary basis.  Today the sector is funded by the HSE, which itself is a direct home care provider, and contracted out to the private and not-for-profit home care companies.  The sector is changing rapidly and not necessarily for the better, as the various home care providers compete for business.  The commissioning or tendering process, which was expected by some to decrease costs and increase value for money, has to date resulted in increased costs and reduced hours of care due to a relatively stagnant budget.  The move to diminish home help funding in favour of more complex home care packages has delayed home care interventions, with the result that older persons now present with more complex needs, require a higher allocation of hours upon engaging with the service and see earlier hospital admissions, all leading to an increased demand for costly long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  The terms and conditions of the 2016 tender resulted in varying standards of care and significant inconsistencies in its implementation across the nine CHOs.  The phasing out of grant funding to community home care providers will definitely drive some out of business.  With decreased numbers of providers, client choice is significantly compromised.<\/p> <p>  The current situation simply breeds uncertainty and insecurity, and has resulted in the sector being less attractive to potential carers.  The recruitment to and retention of persons in the home care profession is undoubtedly the single biggest challenge for all providers and unless there is a serious intervention, we are heading for a major tsunami.<\/p> <p>  NCCN members have a long history in community home care, some with up to 50 years of experience in the sector.  These providers are community based, and have a proven track record of caring for the more vulnerable in our society.  Like any business we need funding to function, but the primary focus of the NCCN is on client care not profitability.  NCCN members are determined to remain at the forefront of home care delivery in Ireland and have fully engaged with the Health Service Executive when invited to do so.  The NCCN is not against change, but feels strongly that we should be afforded the opportunity to be part of the process.  Although client care is our primary objective, NCCN members are in business.  Unlike the private or State providers, our members are subject to even more governance and compliance issues by the Charities Regulatory Authority, CRA, in addition to the Companies Registration Office, CRO, Revenue, and the various service level agreements with funders.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN has from the outset strongly advocated for regulation and common standards across all home care providers, both private and statutory.  We want all home care providers to be accredited in the interests of health and safety of both clients and staff.  We advocate for a social clause in all e-tendering procedures.  Our contention is that early intervention is critical and residential care is not inevitable.  Our primary objective is to work towards keeping older persons at home, but this is dependent on the availability of carers and care hours.  Funding should predominantly be by the State but should not exclude the possibility of a client contribution.  The continuity of care would involve working with primary care teams, including GPs and the public health nurses.  More could be achieved by better integration with other services, such as day centres, meals on wheels and other community organisations like active retired, Age Friendly, Age Action, etc.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN is committed to research and the promotion of technologies that would facilitate home care delivery, client monitoring and safety, but current demands of compliance with all those bodies referenced, the CRO, CRA and Revenue, need to be streamlined because the burden of compliance is significant.  In isolation, funding increases will do little to attract more persons into the home care sector.  If a carer works the shortest call, which is normally 30 minutes, he or she forfeits any entitlement to a social welfare payment for the remainder of that day.  Under such circumstances, there is no incentive to work in that sector.<\/p> <p>  The NCCN has lobbied for a change to Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments based on hours per day to hours per week.  This would require a co-operation across two Departments, namely Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Health.  To date there has not been any obvious political will to effect such a change.  Although there is a need for increased funding to the sector, the recruitment and retention of carers is currently the single biggest challenge to the service.  The committee has a unique opportunity to positively influence the future of home care in the interests of our older persons and an ageing population.  I hope that the committee does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fiacre Hensey"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I have a number of short questions.  Unfortunately, I will have to leave for a couple of minutes so Deputy Durkan will take the Chair.  I will ask my questions and will have an opportunity to read back on the answers in the Official Report.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran talked about the need to maintain standards and how important they are, and I do not think anyone would disagree with that.  Can Mr. Moran comment on whether he believes those standards are being maintained effectively at the moment?  What could be done, even in the short term, to improve things?  We all talk about our ageing population, which is marvellous.  We would all like to grow old in safety and comfort and know that somebody is monitoring those standards.  While we appreciate the evidence from the HSE and the Department of Health about what might happen in future, perhaps Mr. Moran could indicate what could happen in the very short term to ensure those standards are maintained.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea referred to something very interesting, which Mr. Moran might talk about as well, which is what older people want.  We are discussing what they might want in terms of regulation.  Is there a forum other than through representative groups for older persons to feed directly into the system?  If we become more corporatised and move further away from the community base, will the opportunity for older persons to feed into that process be lost?<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the representatives from the NCCN about the difficulty in sourcing home help hours between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., which the representatives from the Department of Health referred to earlier.  They said it is sometimes necessary to go to the private sector to source those hours.  I have said already I have some experience of that.  My experience of dealing with home helps is of them telling me they cannot get enough hours and that they are available to do the work.  Will the witnesses comment on the capacity issue and the ability for a client to top up hours, which was mentioned in the opening remarks of the representatives of the NCCN?  Will they elaborate on exactly what that is?  It is my understanding that when a person has been allocated a certain number of hours, which are paid for by the HSE, the person or his or her family may be able to top those hours up.  If the witnesses excuse me, I have to go but I will be back.

My first question is to Professor Eamon O'Shea.  He commented clearly that rights and regulations without adequate resources are meaningless and will not create certainty and personalised care.  When we ask older people and people with dementia or other care needs what they want, they say they do not want a one-size-fits all solution.  They want the kind of care that fits their circumstances and in the case of dementia, that changes.  When one gets a diagnosis of dementia, one can be very fit and well.  One might need a little bit of help or a reminder to eat, for example, but it can progress.  That kind of personalised care needs to change with the person's needs.<\/p> <p>  I want to hone in on the social insurance model.  Given that the Department of Health is now working up its scheme, what advice would Professor O'Shea give us to advise the Department of Health on the resourcing of home care?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran said there is political will for the development of home care but there is still massive unmet need.  We heard from the Department of Health earlier that it thinks it might be two to three years before a regulatory regime can be introduced.  My husband works for HIQA - not as an inspector - which may be in the frame so I should probably raise that.  What would Mr. Moran ask the committee to say to the Department of Health given there is political will and huge unmet need?  There is also a sense of urgency so that the two-year to three-year timeframe seems far out.  <\/p> <p>  What would Mr. Hensey ask the committee to deliver to the Department of Health in terms of its ongoing deliberations on home care?

Home help and provision of care for the elderly is a huge problem right across the country but it is a particular problem in rural Ireland.  I accept that home help is not the only care that needs to be provided.  Between 2009 and 2010, in one year alone, 32,000 hours of home help were cut in County Mayo.  There was not a problem in the provision of home care at that time but the decision was made for it to be cut.  We were told it would not have any impact on the services provided.  Elderly people are being medically assessed as needing home care and it is not being provided.  The people on the ground do not have the resources to provide it and it is a huge problem.  There has been an increase in the budget but despite that extra allocation in the budget, it is still not working.  People are being assessed but are not getting the care required.<\/p> <p>  The hope that funding would trickle down has been mentioned.  We can talk about this endlessly but we have to remember that older people who need this care, in some cases people who are 99 years of age, are not getting the care they need.  It is a shame on all of us that it is not happening.  There are people in their 80s and 90s trying to care for other people in their 80s and 90s and they are not able to do it.  The impact it is having on their physical and mental health as carers is astounding and is completely wrong.  <\/p> <p>  The other problem is in the provision of care and the availability of carers.  There are some parishes that have no care available.  One of the solutions to that is to revert back to the provision of one hour of care.  The result is we have been telling elderly people they are not even worth one hour of home care, which is wrong.  Can the witnesses see that happening?  Can we force the Government to reverse the situation so that people get one hour?  Forget about the 30 minutes or 45 minutes nonsense of people running across rural parishes trying to provide care - we cannot expect people to do that and to sit into their cars and drive for 30 minutes.  <\/p> <p>  The witness was right when he spoke about connecting people.  How can a person providing care to people in their own homes connect with people when the basic essentials have to be done in 30 minutes?  It is not possible for any human being to do that.  It concerns me that while we have all the right words for providing care for people in their own homes and it is our policy, we do not have the funding.  It should not be a case of the funding trickling down; it should be there and not somewhere else waiting for a hand down.  It should be there within communities to provide home care once the medical assessment is made that it is needed.  I do not want to wait another number of years for that to happen.  It is a decision that could and should be made immediately.  When the assessment is done, the home care should be provided.  I empathise with the people in home help offices who are trying to provide this care.<\/p><p>They are listening to families and must hear their stories every day of the week.  The impact on them as workers trying to provide this care is totally wrong.  We need the funding for it, not just the fancy words.  I accept that it can be provided in different ways, but it was a major policy mistake to privatise what was already working.  I would never advise going backwards, but we must go back and look at the models that were in place before all these drastic cuts started.  Where is the money going?  If people are saying all this money is being provided, where is it going in the system?  It is not going to the 99 year old who is desperately waiting for help to get out of bed in the morning and so forth.  People in rural areas are hugely dependent on proper home care.  This is happening alongside half of the beds being cut in the local community hospital, so people do not have the respite and supports that were available heretofore.  There must be an absolute urgency on that.<\/p><p> However, I am asking the witness about the one hour.  Can the witness see if this business of 30 minutes and 45 minutes can be abolished?  What would it take to do away with that as a policy decision across the board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#P00600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and speakers.  Perhaps they could give us some assistance on the figures for all of this with regard to the demographics and where they are going, if possible.  We heard earlier that there are approximately 195,000 people giving care at an average of 38 hours per week.  It is approximately 6.6 million hours of care.  There is a larger number receiving care.  In some cases, there will be a second person being given care by the same person and, of course, there are people living alone who are receiving home help services to a greater or lesser degree from outside.  Within that figure of 195,000 carers there are informal carers and those receiving some class of care allowance.  I said earlier that money is not the primary lens through which this issue should be viewed, but the witnesses have made it clear that there is no reality to our aspirations and vision unless the resources are in place.  Is there an overall figure?<\/p> <p>  I realise it is a difficult thing to assess and that there might be different metrics.  I asked the officials earlier if they had a figure but they were not in a position to give me one.  That is fair enough, but the State ought to be in a position to estimate how much carers are saving the State through the work they do.  Whether their work is completely informal and not remunerated or one takes into account the carer's allowance they receive, it is far less than it would cost the State to give that full-time care however one measures it, be it in the context of nursing home costs or factoring in an hour-by-hour cost of giving care.  Can the witnesses help us by giving us a sense of how much carers are saving the State, to put it in those terms?<\/p> <p>  Linking that to what Professor O'Shea spoke about regarding the demographics, the rubber is going to hit the road in a much more intense way in the future than is the case at present.  Where are we going in terms of the demographics by 2030, 2040 and 2050 relative to where we are now?  The witnesses are recommending a social insurance system for the funding of all that.  Could they outline what they see as the benefits of that?  Is it to do with the ring-fencing, that if there is a social insurance system the money paid by taxpayers in that way is therefore ring-fenced for spending on care, be it home care or residential?  Are the witnesses thinking of it specifically for community-based care?  I presume that is the case.<\/p> <p>  I realise there is a great deal covered by those questions.  I agree on the need for personalised and responsive services.  I and my family are very involved in a care giving situation and one hears about other people's experiences.  My mother told me recently about a conversation she had with another carer who was informed by the person coming in, with the best will in the world, that they do not do this, that or the other.  Eventually the lady asked in frustration, \"Well, what do you do?\"  Everybody's needs are different, so I empathise with that comment because it brought that thought back to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#Q00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing and the support they have given through the years with regard to elderly care.  I am approaching this from the perspective of trying to fast-track the changes we need.  As I said earlier, I brought forward a legislative measure in 2012 in a Private Member's capacity and it is only now in place, five years later, so I was trying to tie down a timeframe for when we would see the change from the Department and the HSE with regard to the provision of home care.  We are talking about two to three years.  It is important that we try to give every assistance possible to the Department and the HSE to bring that timeline of two to three years forward.<\/p> <p>  With regard to home care, I wish to follow up on what Senator Conway-Walsh raised regarding rural areas where there are insufficient numbers of people available.  It is a huge challenge and it will be an even greater challenge in the next ten years.  There are a number of reasons for that, one of which is the increasing number of elderly people in rural areas.  More people are coming into that category.  On the other side, there is the economic upturn.  Whereas previously people might have been available to provide home care,  they are now not available to provide it.  There are two challenges in that regard.  One of my concerns is whether we have an adequate number of people going through the training process at present to be available to provide home care and how we can incentivise that.<\/p> <p>  If we get more people to provide home care, there will be a huge saving for the State in real terms.  The expenditure on somebody in a nursing home is approximately &euro;50,000 per annum or approximately &euro;1,000 per week, whether it comes from the patient or the State.  Home care, therefore, is not even one third of that if it can be provided adequately whereby people can stay in their own home.  We must incentivise the provision of home care and incentivise the people who could be encouraged to come into it.  Has that issue been considered?  For example, should we consider a scheme whereby for somebody who is providing home care the first &euro;15,000 of their income, if it comes from the provision of home care, would be exempt from tax.  Has something like that been considered, particularly in view of the challenges we are facing now?  With the economic upturn, it will become increasingly difficult to get people to take on this role.<\/p> <p>  I have seen this working successfully.  For example, I know somebody who is in their mid-90s and is confined to a wheelchair.  The person is living alone and as a result of the home care being provided, which is through a combination of her family and the HSE, she is living independently and has a far better way of life than if she was in a nursing home.  That is not to criticise nursing homes.  They provide a very good level of care as well.  However, that lady is far happier and I am sure there are many others in a similar situation.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is older people who are afraid to allow anybody to get in involved in providing care for them, even though they need the care.  I have encountered a number of such instances recently involving people in their 90s who have a mistrust.  In fairness, the community nurse, the community garda and everyone is involved, but we have still failed to get them to accept that home care is the way forward for them.<\/p><p>How would one deal with a situation like that and make progress on such an issue?  I thank Mr. Moran for the work he is doing in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#Q00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>I have a couple of comments rather than questions.  I used to be involved in the health board in the old days and we used to visit all the nursing homes or, as they were called then, segregated hospitals.  One point that comes to my attention all the time is the need for a standardised system that is interdependent and backed up with home help, home care, respite care and access to nursing homes, as required.  This lightens the load on the household and carer and recognises that many carers are caring over their lifetime.  Very often, a mother caring for a child with special needs has heavy responsibilities, including nursing responsibilities, and this can be the case into old age.  This creates obvious serious physical problems for the carer.<\/p> <p>  Community-based social interaction is important.  The person who receives care in the home or elsewhere should be able to meet others and have a chat.  It is a little more difficult in rural areas but it can be done.  The number of community centres might not be as high.  A trip to the pub or elsewhere, for a special outing or otherwise, contributes to the quality of life that the older person should expect.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea stated the patient knows best in any event.  Nobody feels the burden like the patient, for two reasons.  First, the patient feels he is a burden, which creates a further problem in itself.  Second, the patient knows how he feels and what needs to be done to address his issues.  If the patient gets the impression that nobody understands his position or cares, it presents a huge burden in itself, and it creates a huge problem for people in the older age group.  I am mindful of the fact that I am approaching the age group in question, with a certain amount of caution.<\/p> <p>  The transport element is important.  There are a number of rural transport groups up and running throughout the country.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has quite extensive services in some areas, but not throughout the country to the extent needed.  Services exist, however, and clearly demonstrate the quality of service that can be provided when there are dedicated individuals to offer it.  All the services that are needed, to a greater extent among older people, ought to be provided in the same way, as is required, and as they would be offered in an institutional environment.  If they do not receive the services, it will create further problems. <\/p> <p>  I was involved in the provision of services previously in the old nursing homes, old hospitals, district hospitals, etc.  This was before there was any direct provision for the private nursing homes.  There was a considerable controversy over the old age pension.  It was ceded to the hospital or nursing home, generating much criticism.  When that stopped, the whole system became very much more expensive.  I have thought about it in the meantime.  At least the old system, which may be archaic by our standards today, provided residential care of a very good standard at a time when there were very few other services available for older people.<\/p> <p>  Some 85% of citizens are older people.  This is interesting but it is no harm to remember that there is a growing cohort of younger people.  Immigrants have generally been younger people.  There is a significant cohort of younger people who will be taxpayers into the future.  The imbalance that exists will not be as great as in some other European countries.  We will be compensated in that way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#R00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I am really sorry but I must leave as I have another group coming.

When the Chairman asked how we maintain standards, the first word that came to my mind, and which was raised by Senator Burke, was \"training\".  This is an area in which the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has done some work with home care workers, highlighting some of the challenges they face.  Some challenges concern employment issues and zero-hour contracts.  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the issue of people hurtling across the country to try to deliver even 15 minutes of home care and then hurtling away somewhere else.  What could be done?  We could try to support training for home care workers, particularly as an increasing number of people with increasingly complex needs will be at home.  We have come across care workers being put in a position where they are being asked to do things they do not believe they are fully trained or able for.  I do not have figures for the Irish context in this regard.  In our research, we came across an NHS briefing paper that highlighted that 60% of the NHS training budget went towards what could be described as the most highly skilled professionals, including doctors and nurses.  Not nearly as much money went to the care workers, the health care assistants and people providing hands-on care.<\/p> <p>  With regard to maintaining and improving standards right now, the issue of training is critical.  This relates to the point Senator Conway-Walsh raised on the limited amount of time available.  If one has 15 or 30 minutes in which to get somebody up in the morning, there is no chance of building a relationship with that person.  It can also be quite harassing for the older person.  One has to get that person into the shower and usher them along the whole time.  This can be quite pressurised.  We need to do more to support workers and improve the process for the recruitment and retention of care workers to ensure caring is seen as a valid career path with training and professional development.  If we can achieve this, and if the care workers have the time to deliver the service, we will see standards increase, as referred to by the Chairman.  As I stated, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has done work on this.  I highly recommend it to the committee. <\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Kelleher's point on political will and the period of two to three years, obviously we would prefer to see progress made sooner but we would prefer the job to be done right more than anything else.  If it takes two to three years to develop a statutory scheme for home care that is effective and deals with the issues highlighted by the other members of the committee, that can be lived with, as long as it is not pushed on further.  That is the medium to long-term solution.  The crisis in home care is happening now.  This was raised a couple of times by people talking about their experience of constituents coming to them and the question of how serious it is gaining access to home care. <\/p> <p>  When I talk about the political will expressed in comments of politicians and political parties suggesting they support home care, I always regard the October budget as the real representation of political will.  Maybe this is a little cynical.  The budget shows where money goes and does not go.  Professor O'Shea, who was talking about budgeting earlier, was highlighting that, in general, based on taxation, which is how we are providing funding at present, we have seen community care cut back.  To have greater representation of political will, as raised by Senator Kelleher, we would like to see more money invested in home care supports and home help hours.  We would also like to have further clarity regarding where the money is going.  Senator Conway-Walsh raised this.  As I said in my presentation, there are very wide differences between community health organisations.  The average member of the public could not tell one what a community health organisation is but, depending on which side of this CHO boundary one meets, one could get the care one needs.  If one is on the other side, one does not get it at all.  Although the money is going to the CHOs, it is a question of how it is being spent.  It would be great to achieve clarity on that.   If there is something the committee could focus on seriously while we are working on making progress on the statutory scheme, in addition to funding and transparency over funding, it is the expansion of reablement programmes.  Three or four years ago in north Dublin, the HSE carried out a pilot study on reablement.<\/p><p>I could be wrong, but I believe that approximately 200 older people in acute hospitals were assessed as needing home help hours.  Instead of getting home help hours, they went through a six-week reablement programme with very intensive supports, including occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  It was like teaching the person how to live independently again.  When the reablement programme had concluded, 80% of those older people were assessed as needing either no home help hours or fewer hours.  The programme has also being rolled out in Glasgow and there is a very good case study, which we highlighted in our pre-budget submission on health.  We have a successful HSE pilot programme in north Dublin.  Could this be expanded and run on a national basis to see whether we can deliver reablement and, as a result of this, reduce demand for home help hours and free up resources?<\/p><p> I have addressed Senator Conway-Walsh's points on the issues of time and where the money is going, and the need for social interaction raised by the Acting Chairman.  To go back to Senator Mullen's point, perhaps my colleagues have better information on the number of carers.  The participation of organisations such as Family Carers Ireland and Care Alliance would be very important in the committee's deliberations and in the context of its work.  They would be able to deliver a very informed perspective on it.  Senator Mullen spoke about the experience of a carer coming in and stating that this is what he or she does and this is what he or she does not do.<\/p><p> Funding is critical.  We support lot of the arguments made by Professor O'Shea, but what are we paying for?  Earlier, a departmental official said people are willing to make contributions but for what are they making contributions?  What do we mean by a statutory home care scheme?  What does it actually mean?  Is it home help hours or home care?  What is the role of assistive technology?  Will it deal with personal care or household tasks?  We definitely need to deal with the issue of funding because if we do not, we will end up with a statutory scheme that delivers nothing.<\/p><p> We also need to develop a very clear idea that when we use the phrase \"home care\" everybody in this room and everybody applying for it has a very clear idea of what it actually means.  For example, a standard home care basket, whatever that might be, might be free, but contributions might be paid for personal care services.  This was being discussed as one of the Health Research Board's comparisons.  I am a 39 year old man.  If, in three years' time, I am told I must start paying a social insurance contribution towards long-term care, I would not have a problem with it.  However, I would really like to know what I will get when I reach the age when I will be looking for that long-term care.  Something that has always struck me is when consultation for the statutory home care scheme was announced and launched by the Department, all of the coverage in the newspapers the next day was about payments, how it will be paid for, whether it would be means tested and whether there would be co-payments or contributions.  These are critical parts of the discussion, but we also need to know what we will pay for as well is how we will pay for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>There are lots of questions and I will try to weave in answers to them rather than-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>Professor O'Shea should give it his best shot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>There are several really good elements and it is important to say what they are.  A strong sense of intergenerational solidarity exists in the country.  We are not starting from a base where we do not have willingness or a commitment of support.  Whether this is through care, through families caring, through contributions or through our social insurance system, there is a strong element of solidarity.  In recent years, we have had really good examples of where personalised care is working.  There have been a number of innovations, particularly for people with dementia, throughout the country.  There are programmes in Mayo, south Tipperary, south Dublin and Kinsale in Cork.  There are many interesting projects.  We are not starting from a zero base with regard to personalised care.  We know older people and their families like this.  There are good models in terms of what we want to do.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of the demographic changes that will happen.  At present, 55,000 people have dementia and they require various levels of care on a continuum.  We know this will increase to approximately 100,000 by 2026 and up to 150,000 over the next 15 years.  We know it will double and treble in the foreseeable future.  This is not decades away.  This is a good example of how numbers should concentrate minds.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to know for sure how many carers we have looking after older people and the number of hours they do.  From the limited surveys we have done, we estimate there are approximately 60,000 carers of people with dementia, ranging from cognitive impairment to advanced dementia.  Many of these carers provide hours of care in terms of work we would shy away from in the formal paid labour market.  Very often it is alone and debilitating, and very often shocks happen in the system of care to which there is not an immediate response and people are left even more vulnerable.  These numbers have meaning.  They are not just numbers or estimates, they have real meaning.  What does this mean for a personalised, person-centred base in terms of the provision of supports and where do older people fit in?  Whether they are physically or cognitively dependent, the voices of older people must be central.  We cannot run a system where it is supply-side driven and provider-driven with an \"I know best\" approach.  We will not get the connectivity or the social model of production where people are integrated and visible and we have an equitable provision throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked as to how we get this voice.  There are good things happening in this regard.  We have the Irish dementia working group, associated with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, and we hear directly from people with dementia.  We need to hear the direct voice in various fora and the policymakers need to hear it.  We need champions, and that refers to this building and this group.  We need champions, and not just the advocacy groups who are champions in their own right.  We need political champions.  If we look at countries where there has been political championing of older people's issues there has been an impact in the policy-making process.  Over the coming years, it would be very helpful if there was direct championing of these issues in the political process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamon O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>I do not mean to push Professor O'Shea, but we must be somewhere else very shortly.

This goes back to the question of home help hours and half hours.  Basic humanity is the essence of person-centred care.  It cannot be done in half an hour or an hour.  It has to be consistent and reliable.  It has to be based on knowledge of the person.  These are essentials of a home care system.  When people speak about a home care system in terms of just hours, they should not miss the fundamental relationships that are critical to the care process.  These underpin the care process.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of charging and cost sharing, we need to be careful about having cost sharing for community-based care.  If we believe home care is the optimal approach, the introduction of cost sharing may incentivise the very opposite of what we want to happen.

All providers provide care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  In that regard, most of our organisations are reliant on core funding from the HSE, which historically was for the provision of care in the morning Monday to Friday and typically for early intervention care through what were originally domestic type duties.  During the years that has changed to personal care which everybody in receipt of care from our organisations now receives.  However, we very strongly advocate that the committee consider early intervention care and its effectiveness in keeping people at home, thus reducing the number of hospital admissions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly also asked about clients having the ability to top up the care they received that was provided and paid for by the HSE.  Unfortunately, our organisations are currently unable to provide private top-up paid care.

One good measure which has come from the past couple of tenders is the stipulation that carers should have formal qualifications.  That began in the 2014 tender process, whereby one was obliged to have completed two FETAC level 5 modules.  That increased to eight modules but was then reduced in the 2016 tender process.  There is an inconsistency, but things have been done.  Many of our members or carers have completed eight care modules, which is a significant qualification.  Like the other delegates, we would welcome regulation, but we should not flog ourselves to death for not doing anything because we have done quite a lot.  I reluctantly accept that it takes two or three years to come up with a regulation, policy or whatever else, but there are issues that can be progressed in spite of formal regulations not being in place.  That will need will and co-operation.  We are endeavouring to co-operate with the HSE in various fora to advance things, in spite of regulations not being in place.<\/p> <p>  There has been a crossover in the questions asked.  I reiterate that the availability of carers is the biggest problem across the country in the delivery of home care services.  We do not like to call ourselves a voluntary organisation because people then think we do everything for free.  Recruitment is crucial for not-for-profit organisations, private companies or more acute business models and the State which is a provider of care through the HSE, but it is currently very difficult for it to take place.  I have given the committee the solution and would like to think it has the power to approach the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Health in that regard.  If we do not move on this issue, it will not matter how much money we put into it.  We need to make it an area in which people can work.<\/p> <p>  On the nature of care, as Mr. Moran and others have mentioned, the limited time period of 30 minutes was rolled out as a cost-saving ploy.  Perhaps it might work for medical prompts or something similar, but in general it is not enough time.  One hour was the standard amount of time spent with a client and some of us have followed that practice for nearly 50 years.  I fully agree with Senator Rose Conway-Walsh that it should remain.  It is very important that there be co-operation between the two Departments which as a non-political grouping we have tried to encourage.  The committee probably has far more strength than we do to push it forward and it is the biggest thing for which I ask.<\/p> <p>  A significant change in the home care sector is the running down of the home help budget.  There has been a drop of up to 25% in the home help budget as opposed to home care packages.  As Ms Jackson said, as a result, one no longer has one to three hours for early intervention care but is forced into the complex 15 or 20 hours arrangement.  That does not make any sense because we know that early intervention results in people staying at home for longer for 25% of those in receipt of care if one tracks them back to when the intervention happened.  We need to focus on early intervention and not push it aside in favour of more complex arrangements.  Things have got a little mixed up.  Complex cases should be kept at home with better trained staff and not have to be dealt with in a hospital.  If a person reaches a certain stage of deterioration or debilitation, he or she will have to go into hospital, but that process should be delayed, if not avoided.  That can be done.<\/p> <p>  Historically assessments were holistic and took into account which neighbours and family members could provide support.  One could then allocated the minimum number of hours because it would be complemented by the efforts of those around the client, but that has largely stopped and now a more formal structure is wanted.  I am all for that and it could be done using the common summary assessment report, CSAR, or another assessment tool.  In many places we had that holistic assessment.  If one's assessment indicated that one needed three or five hours of support, it was very hard to provide that amount of care.  We are inundated with requests to get people onto the ladder of care.  At the same time, however, we must prioritise complex cases, which is a contradiction.<\/p> <p>  I take on board what has been said by Professor O'Shea about clients paying for extra hours of care.  Historically, there was a means test and people who were able to pay, did so.  If there is no money available, clients topping up their number of care hours might be one of the only ways for them to receive sufficient care.  The majority of our members do not generally look for that business.<\/p> <p>  We need regulations and standards because of the inconsistencies nationwide.  I reiterate that all of our members would welcome a system under which tenders would be scrapped and there would be some form of accreditation.  There would be a list of accredited providers and people who had passed the test which would be available to anybody across the country who wanted it.  He or she could select an organisation knowing that it ticked the boxes in terms of compliance and standards.  It could be worked out without formal legislation.<\/p><p>The idea of a holistic, person-centred care approach has been done.  It is now being piloted as a new idea in community health organisation three, CHO3, in the mid-west.  In that approach the client has full say on how the hours are allocated.  That is happening.  That has been running since about September.  If there is a family carer in a household his or her request might be to have a break because if he or she burns out one is in serious trouble.  The home help or carer going in would release the person to go and take a walk, go down town, get out, get their hair done or whatever.  That is as important in the continuity of care as it is to go in and prompt medicines, etc.  I thank the committee very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017111500002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fiacre Hensey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

Why work further then if they sacrifice any right to a social welfare payment?<\/p> <p>  That is why I am pushing the idea that it be worked out on the basis of working X number of hours for a working week.  Then carers, whether they work five hours in one day or five hours across five days, would still be entitled to the balance as a social welfare payment.  Most of those we would interact with do not want a social welfare payment.  However, they do want security of income and they do not have it.  I have had people coming up to me and saying, \"I cannot get a credit union loan because I do not know how much I will be earning next month.\"  There has to be a way that fuses the two together.

In this, I do not propose to deal with community-related issues as they are now the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  <\/p> <p>  To the end of June 2017, the Department had spent &euro;662 million from its allocation of &euro;1.779 billion as set out in the original 2017 Estimates, some &euro;20 million ahead of the published profile of expenditure for the Department of &euro;642 million.  When community spending programmes are excluded, the total at the end of June was &euro;625 million from the revised allocation of &euro;1.995 billion, capital and current.  This was some &euro;30 million ahead of the revised profile of expenditure.  I have circulated with my statement today tables that summarise the capital and current expenditure position at the end of June and as it now stands in November 2017.  The tables show that capital expenditure now amounts to some &euro;514 million, or 74% of the allocation, and current expenditure is now &euro;575 million or some 44% of the full-year allocation.  The position on spending on the Vote is being kept under close review in my Department as we move towards year end.  On the basis of the information now available, I expect we will be at full expenditure at year end.  In this process, we will reallocate funds as necessary to help ensure maximum benefits are achieved from the resources made available to us.  We will also continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as required in finalising the position on the Vote for 2017.<\/p> <p>  Turning briefly to some of the larger programmes, in 2017 the combined capital and current housing allocation is &euro;1.2 billion.  In addition, certain local authorities are funding a range of housing services from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to the value of over &euro;98 million, bringing the total housing provision to some &euro;1.3 billion.  To date in 2017, some &euro;498 million of Exchequer funding has been spent on housing capital programmes with a further &euro;77 million being spent by local authorities from surplus LPT receipts, the bulk of which has been used to support the construction and acquisition of social housing homes.  Reflecting the increased activity by local authorities and AHBs, 76% of the housing capital budget has already been spent.  Some &euro;402 million has been spent under the housing current expenditure programmes and this has been supplemented by spending totalling &euro;22 million by local authorities from surplus LPT receipts.  The high level of expenditure to date reflects the accelerated delivery of social housing across all programmes and we are well-positioned to achieve our 2017 target of 21,000 housing solutions for individuals and families.  In respect of HAP, I am pleased to say we have already exceeded our target under Rebuilding Ireland, with more than 15,130 tenancies established to date, which is an average of 344 HAP tenancies established every week in 2017.  In addition, almost 1,400 new homes have been delivered through the social housing current expenditure programme and we expect to reach the target of 2,250 homes before year end.  In the six months to the end of June, we delivered 800 new homes under the local authority build and acquisitions programme and a further 245 homes for older people, homeless people or people with a disability through the capital assistance scheme.<\/p> <p>  The level of social housing construction activity continues to grow as can be seen in the status reports published by my Department.  The most recent report to the end of the second quarter of 2017 shows there are projects which will deliver 11,000 new social homes, of which more than 1,000 homes have already been delivered in 2016 and the first half of 2017.  Over 2,700 new homes are on site being constructed.  The remainder are progressing through planning, design and tendering and we have not stopped.  Approvals for new social housing construction schemes are being issued to local authorities on an almost daily basis and I have no doubt this will be reflected when the third quarter status report is published in the coming weeks. <\/p> <p>  A key priority for my Department is addressing the issue of vacant homes.  Under the national voids programme, over 700 local authority homes have now been returned to productive use in 2017.  I expect we will be in a position to deliver almost 1,400 such homes this year, a near doubling of our target of 766.  In conjunction with the delivery of new social homes, my Department is focused on ensuring people are supported to stay within their own homes in line with their changing needs.  To date, we have provided almost 6,200 housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability and expect to meet or exceed the 2017 target of 9,000 grants. <\/p> <p>  Turning to LIHAF, while there will be an underspend this year due to projects being at design stage, with the larger construction costs expected to fall due from 2018 onwards, savings are being used to support increased activity under the local authority capital programme, including through the direct delivery of new social homes via construction and acquisition.<\/p><p>The funding for LIHAF projects is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to draw down over the lifetime of the projects out to 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p> Turning to my Department&rsquo;s water programme, as I mentioned at the select committee meeting this morning, following the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refunds to domestic customers, an additional provision of some &euro;293 million for payment to Irish Water has been made in the Revised Estimate.  This includes &euro;173 million needed to pay refunds to the 990,000 domestic customers.  There are also administrative costs associated with the refund process, estimated to amount to almost &euro;5.9 million.  In addition, &euro;114 million is being provided to cover the funding required by Irish Water arising from the extension of the suspension of domestic water charges to the end of 2017.  Funding will be made available to Irish Water to allow it to commence refund payments to customers following on from the passage of the Water Services Bill 2017.<\/p><p> The local government fund allocation in 2017 is &euro;365 million.  Total expenditure to date is &euro;100 million.  Significant payments from the fund take place in December and it is intended that there will be full expenditure of the allocation by the end of the year.<\/p><p> Turning now to the year ahead, the committee will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2018 will be &euro;2.457 billion in total.  Within that, housing is by far the biggest programme.  All told, &euro;1.9 billion will be available for housing next year, an increase of &euro;600 million, or 46%, on 2017.  This investment is directly aimed at addressing our housing shortage and homelessness crisis.  It represents an increase of 62% on the capital side, to build new homes and 35% on the current side, to over &euro;760 million, to allow further action on homelessness, as well as supporting people into new social housing tenancies through the HAP scheme.  In budget 2018, the total funding provision of &euro;1.9 billion for housing will allow us to deliver housing solutions for 25,500 households.  A large element of this, &euro;1.14 billion, is for the targeted delivery of new social homes through a range of construction, refurbishment and acquisition programmes.  Next year, 3,800 new social homes will be built directly by local authorities and approved housing bodies, which is 1,800 more homes than we will build in 2017.  A further 1,200 will be Part V builds or refurbished vacant homes, 900 homes will be delivered through acquisitions and a further 2,000 homes will be secured through long-term leasing arrangements, resulting in a total of 7,900 new social homes.<\/p><p> Looking beyond 2018, the budget provides an extra &euro;500 million for capital investment in social housing in the years 2019 to 2021, inclusive, which has allowed us to increase the Rebuilding Ireland social housing target from 47,000 to 50,000 homes.  As regards the funding of Irish Water in 2018, the Water Services Bill 2017 provides for a new funding model for domestic water services under which funding will be made through the Vote for the Department.  This will involve technical adjustments to the Vote and the consequential reform of the local government fund.  These changes will be made in the context of the Revised Estimates for 2018.  The channelling of all funding for domestic water services to Irish Water through the Vote will improve the transparency and accountability arrangements for this expenditure.  In overall terms, some &euro;1.1 billion will be required to meet the cost of domestic water services in 2018, of which &euro;500 million relates to capital investment.  This is the major financing component of the overall planned investment of over &euro;600 million in cash terms by Irish Water in 2018.<\/p><p> I hope that members have found this contribution helpful and I will be happy to deal with matters that members wish to raise, either on 2017 or 2018.  My officials will be in a position to come before the committee to give a more detailed update on the Rebuilding Ireland targets at a later date.  I would like to point out that next week or the week after I will be publishing targets for each local authority's social housing output programme for 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#A00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>Members are reminded that they have five minutes to ask questions of the Minister and he will be given five minutes to respond.

That said, there is an overspend on local authority housing of 11% and an underspend on voluntary and co-operative housing of 28%.  At the end of October, housing inclusion support was down by 60%.  The biggest disappointment is the fact that there has been no draw down on the &euro;50 million infrastructure fund to date.

This is because we are ramping up our programmes in terms of delivery for build, acquisition and everything else that we are hoping to do in respect of social housing.  Traditionally, capital spend drawdown can be lumpy in any year.  It would not necessarily be smooth over each month or each quarter but as we ramp up and as people become more familiar with the programmes and draw down their funding, we are actually finding a more even drawdown on the capital side.  We are on target to spend our money this year, according to the figures that we have up to October or November.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the subhead for housing inclusion and Traveller accommodation, we are working to increase the spends and the supports for local authorities to deliver and to support Traveller needs.  There will be an increased budget in 2018, from &euro;9 million to &euro;12 million, is important.  It is equally important that we make sure that funding is delivered effectively and efficiently to meet those needs.<\/p> <p>  The LIHAF from central government is ring-fenced in the capital programme but it will not necessarily have been drawn down by the end of the year.  Some of it will be drawn down this year but, obviously, the full &euro;50 million will not be drawn down.  However, that funding will be protected.  It is important to note that 28 of the 34 programmes that have been signed off are already at design stage, so work is already progressing.  The work is under way.  Whether the money is actually called upon within the next month or two does not really matter, so long as work is progressing and is not delayed by the fact that money has not been drawn down yet.

In that context, I particularly welcome the decision to designate Drogheda as a rent pressure zone.  Is there any other funding available to help people in particularly difficult circumstances?  I do not want to get into the specifics of any case but sometimes people are homeless because of issues in their past lives which could involve significant debt to another local authority, for example.  Some people with young families may have a debt that they cannot discharge which means that they cannot even get onto the housing list.

I will make a number of points, taking into account the context in which the question is framed and the <i>Daft.ie <\/i>report.  It is important to note that the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has its own rent index.  This is based on a much larger data set, with more aggregate.  It is based on actual registered tenancies and rents paid, not rents advertised.  The index is more accurate.  The data it contains relates to the quarters during which the rent pressures zones, RPZs, have already been in effect.  The <i>Daft.ie<\/i>research includes data from 2016 when the RPZs were not in existence.  We work to the data from the RTB.  While it shows an increase in rents, it also shows that the RPZs are having the intended effect in terms of keeping rent inflation below 4%.  Obviously, with every quarter, RPZs will take effect in new areas.  Most recently, zones came into effect in Drogheda and Wicklow.<\/p><p>I welcome the Deputy's comments on the role HAP plays, particularly as it does not always get the support it should.  It is a very significant measure that is being implemented by the State, using taxpayers' money to provide housing supports for people to access accommodation in the private rented sector.  We do not have enough social housing units to accommodate the needs of all relevant citizens at present.  Until we build more social housing units - and we have a programme for that - we will have to use other means.  HAP is one way in which we can actually find secure sustainable tenancies for people, with which they are very happy, into the long term.  This is evidenced by the number of HAP tenancies that have been achieved every week this year.  The figure will increase next year.  It is expected that approximately 47,000 tenancies will be supported in the course of 2018.  HAP plays a very significant role.  One of the important things we have done in the aftermath of the housing summit I hosted in September is that we have made arrangements to roll out the HAP place finder and the supports relating to it nationally.  As a result, where people experience difficulties in getting deposits or their first month's rent together, that support can help them to obtain tenancies.  The vast majority of people do not need help but there are some who do.  It is important that we have the support in place to help them.<\/p><p>One of the things the homeless inter-agency group I set up following the housing summit is doing is ensuring that the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities and the HSE are working together to ensure that the resources that are being invested - there is a great deal of money involved - benefit people who are in need of support and are being used in an effective way.  We have other programmes, such as the Abhaile service, that can help.  We have to be sensitive to people's individual needs.  This sometimes means that we have to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis.  Some cases are challenging because they involve complex needs.  There is no reason that a person should be sleeping in a car at all on any night of the year.

The headline above an article in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>morning states, &quot;Less than 1% of needed social housing has been built since start of 2016, says analyst&quot;.  In the article, Mr. Mel Reynolds, a housing policy analyst, provides statistics that I will not go into in detail.  That said, 6,005 people in Cork city are in need of social housing but only 59 houses were provided last year.  That is less than 1%.  Mr. Reynolds indicates that in the context of the demand for the social housing nationally, 120,598 people are in need of social housing and 1,093 units have been provided.  Again, that is less that 1%.  The purpose of what we are doing today is to look forward.  In that context, will there be an improvement and will it be a major improvement as opposed to something more minor in nature?<\/p><p>Statistics indicate that 1,509 new units will become available next year, if one excludes those that will be built by the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and voids.  At that rate, it would take 80 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  If we were to provide 2,000 homes on the basis of new builds - including those relating to the AHBs - for councils and excluding acquisitions, it would take 60 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  Even if we take the overall figure of 3,800, it would take more than 30 years to provide homes for 120,000 people.  Will the Minister comment on the provision for social housing next year, which falls way short of what is needed in view of the crisis we are facing?<\/p><p>Mr. Reynolds is also quoted as saying that the figures are very poor and that &quot;You have to wonder is this policy&quot;.  In other words, he is veering in the direction of saying that not just the housing crisis but also, perhaps, that relating to homelessness are the result of Government policy.  This is in the context of a raft of comments in recent days.  The Taoiseach stated that the homelessness figures are low by international standards, which is not the case.  The Chairman of the Housing Agency states that the situation is normal and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, indicated yesterday that the comments of those who are raising points about homelessness are having a negative impact on the country's image.  These are attempts to minimise and to normalise the homelessness crisis.  The comments that have been made are cold and calculating.  I do not believe they are off the cuff; I am of the view that they are clearly part of a co-ordinated campaign and I ask the Minister of State, in light of what he said last night, to comment on that.  Does he deny that this is part of a co-ordinated campaign to minimise and normalise the homelessness crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#C01000","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister and the Minister of State to respond, if they choose to do so, but that is not what we are here to discuss.

A further 110 schemes, involving 1,106 homes, have practically been completed.  At various stages prior to completion, we have a few hundred schemes coming through with a few thousand homes, which gives us the overall figure of 11,000 under the current construction status figures.  When a newspaper article refers to less than 1% of houses built since the start of 2016, I really do not understand what figures they are relying on, what they are excluding or what they are including.  When we talk about meeting the needs of the tens of thousands on the social housing lists, let us look at the targets we have set in Rebuilding Ireland.  There is an allocation of &euro;6 billion until 2021 to meet all those needs.<\/p><p>Next year, we will build 3,800 social housing homes between local authorities and housing bodies.  That will be almost double what we will build this year, which is 2,000.  When we include voids and Part V units, it is another 1,200 units, which will bring us to 5,000.  We are going to acquire another 900 homes into the social housing stock, which brings us 5,900 and will long-term lease a further 2,000 units.  That is 7,900 secure social housing homes for people next year.  Obviously, there are other needs we need to meet and we use things like the housing assistance payment, HAP, to do that.  If we look over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland and consider what we want to build, to lease in the long term and to acquire, as well the voids we want to convert and the Part V units that will come in, we are talking about 50,000 homes thanks to the additional &euro;500 million that was acquired in the course of the capital review I undertook with the Minister of Finance earlier this year.  That is 50,000 secure sustainable social housing homes over the course of the period from 2016 to 2021, in addition to meeting the needs of others who have needs on the social housing list.  They will be met through the various supports including the HAP.  Next, we will be talking a bit about what the actual numbers are and whether it is 91,000 or a bit higher or a bit lower.  In the programme we have, however, we do not refer to timeframes of 80 years or 60 years.  We will do a significant amount of work between now and 2021 because of the priority the Government places on meeting the social housing needs of the citizens.  If considers the last two years of the Rebuilding Ireland programme and what we will be doing in respect of building, acquiring and leasing versus relying on the private rental market, we will be doing more on the build, acquisition and leasing side than on the HAP side.  As for claims that we rely too heavily on the private rental sector, we will bring the balance back to the responsibility of the State in respect of social housing delivery.  <\/p><p> When we look beyond 2021 - I am already doing this - to ascertain how we can make sure in future that we are protecting the needs of citizens by directly delivering social housing for local authorities and housing bodies and though other means, we aspire to a position in which 20% to 25% of all housing output in a given year is social housing provided directly by the State.  That is what we want to do and by doing that we will make sure that the people who are most vulnerable in our society in terms of their housing needs will always be protected, regardless of whether there is another housing crisis or another property bust in the future.  That is a very important goal that I wish to achieve in the Department.  Next week or in the week after, in another important point on which I touched in my opening statement, we will publish the targets for next year for all local authorities in order that there can be full transparency for Deputies and councillors as to what their own local authority is meant to achieve in respect of social housing output.  I will make that available to everyone in order that we can see what we need to achieve together.  <\/p><p> On the comments and question about the Taoiseach and Conor Skehan, the outgoing chair of the Housing Agency, we have a homelessness crisis.  One thing I have said since I first took up this role and was asked to do this job on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland is that it is very important to continue to talk about this issue, that is, to talk about the actual causes of homelessness and the very difficult circumstances people are experiencing.  While all members of this committee might be very familiar with it, some people are not that familiar with the problem and do not know the level of difficulty that some are experiencing.  We have had a tradition and a culture in this country of hiding difficulties in society and challenges we have faced.  That has been the way for far too long, that is, to turn an blind eye or to try to put something to one side.  It is very important that the homelessness crisis is front and centre in public debate and that people are aware that far too many people - families and individuals -  are experiencing extremely difficult circumstances with regard to both their housing needs and other problems such as mental health and addiction issues.  The Government must make sure as a priority that it is putting in every resource it can to help these people.  <\/p><p> In September, while people were going back to school, one very brave family went on the radio to tell their story of what that was like for the mother and her daughters.  It really touched a chord with people throughout the country.  They realised, if they had not done so previously, that in Irish society today, homelessness unfortunately is hitting and hurting people it had not previously.  That is why we are investing so much to try to support families who have found themselves in these very difficult circumstances.  That is why Deputies will have an opportunity later today to discuss this issue in the context of the Labour Party Bill before them.  That is why every week, both before and since the D&aacute;il returned after the summer, we have been discussing housing and homelessness issues and the difficulty people have in that situation.  To be frank about what the Taoiseach said at the weekend, he was asked a question about homelessness in Ireland being high by international standards.  He responded that it was low by international standards and in the same breath, he clarified that regardless of the international comparisons, we have a responsibility to people in the country who are experiencing these difficult circumstances.<\/p><p> It is important to know where we stand internationally because it is important that we can have an objective view of our policies and whether they are working.  All of the objective evidence tells us that by international comparisons, our rates of homelessness are low.  That points to policies that are working in this country, some that are working and some that are not.  When Conor Skehan talks about things being normal, he is talking about people understanding that homelessness is a crisis that many Western economies and societies face at present.  We are not exceptional in that case.  However, there is nothing normal for a family or an individual who are homeless today and there is nothing normal about how we work with the voluntary organisations and the local authorities to help those people.  We must, of course, help them with compassion and with care.  That is why when I talk about helping families who are in hotels and have been in hubs and when people ask me about timelines, I talk about being sensitive to their needs and delivering a tailored response to make sure that we have the greatest care because for a family or an individual to find themselves in homelessness -  we have all met people who unfortunately are in these circumstances - it is incredibly stressful and difficult and if their needs are not met with care, we could do damage inadvertently or they could find themselves suffering for a very long time into their adult lives and their future lives, which we do not want.  That is what we are trying to do here.  There is no attempt to minimise this as a problem.

That goes back to the commentary to which I was referring last night.  The commentary we hear on the homelessness and housing situation in Ireland often tries to give the impression that absolutely nothing is being done.  That is an unfair commentary on the Irish people, who are spending billions every year through the Government trying to help solve homelessness, to deal with homelessness from an emergency point of view and in the long term as well.  A lot of money is being spent on this with &euro;6 billion committed and more than &euro;2 billion will be spent in this area next year.  As for the constant commentary, the Deputy might have remained to hear some of the debates we have had in recent weeks in the D&aacute;il.  In every week since September, when speaking in D&aacute;il debates on housing, I have asked everybody to just deal with some of the facts.  I have no problem with people pushing for more and I understand that.  We put all the facts out there and do not try to hide any numbers but Members consistently come into the Chamber to contribute to debates and leave out the view that as a State, we are helping 21,000 people in a housing situation.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, and I keep saying we know it still is not enough to deal with the problem, that we are putting more money into the problem, are providing more solutions and keep trying.  However, the commentary that we are doing nothing cannot continue because that is damaging to us as a nation and to all those who are working in the front-line services night in and night out to provide help and accommodation and who are trying to work on long-term and short-term solutions.  That is what I discussed in my speech last night and I will defend that again because it is important that we recognise that.<\/p> <p>  In addition, as a nation we are trying to win investment from many different sectors in our society including job creation etc.  If all those outside looking in think the Government is sitting idly back and doing nothing to solve the housing problem, they might consider investing elsewhere and it is important that we on reflect what we are doing.  The Government consistently states that it never hides this, it knows that it is not enough to solve the problem and that it cannot stop until there is nobody in a homeless situation or on an emergency bed.  Please do not keep saying nothing has been done.  That is not a fair reflection and that is what I discussed in my contribution to the debate last night.  I ask the Deputy to take time out and listen to the full discussion because this goes back to my problem.  Even in the article published today by Mel Reynolds, he picks on one piece of the overall range of solutions and range of actions.  That is not good enough as a commentary and nor is it good enough for any Deputy to pick one area.  We are open to criticism on specific areas; that is not a problem and we take it quite well.  However, we are entitled to deal with the facts of the situation.  That is all I ever ask people to do in debates and that reflects the views expressed last night.  A lot of good work is being carried out here on behalf of the State and through voluntary bodies that needs to be recognised.  They are helping many people and we want to help more.  While that is what we all want to do, people should not ignore that work that has been done as well.  It is not fair to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#D01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has taken 14 minutes but I will allow you to come back in for 30 seconds to wrap up.

I have three questions but I want to make three observations first.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach said over the weekend that our levels of homelessness are low when compared to our peers.  That is a fact.  When he was pressed by the journalist at the press event, he referenced the 2017 OECD report.  The 2017 OECD report is a short and easy report to read.  It makes explicitly clear in its first page that there is no standard definition of homelessness between the listed OECD states.  It states that there is a wide variety of categories of homelessness.  Anyone who knows how we categorise homelessness, that is, by using the section 10 emergency-funded accommodation category, knows that we have one of the narrowest definitions in the OECD.  The OECD report states that we cannot compare from state to state.  Let us flip on two pages in the report to the table provided by the OECD.  It states clearly that the figures for Ireland are 2015 figures.  We all know that the figures have doubled since then.<\/p> <p>  This is not a row about statistics.  If we are going to find solutions to tackle the problem, we need to understand the depth and extent of the problem.  It is extremely unwise of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to try to use a report to make a claim publicly that the same report does not support - that is all I am saying.  The Taoiseach did it again twice yesterday.  He contradicted Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, because he said the report was a 2017 report, and he is right.  However, the figures are from 2015 and that is written in the report.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, should acknowledge that.  Prior to the Taoiseach's comments, when we have debated the matter on two or three occasions in the House the Minister has referenced that we have a lower level of homelessness when compared to our peers.  There is no evidence to support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E01800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>The point is made.

I have never said that we have a higher rate of homelessness than anywhere else.  In fact, I no one in the committee has ever said that.  However, we have an unacceptably high level.  In fact, there is evidence to suggest that it is higher than our immediate peers, as Eoin O'Sullivan has written about recently.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p><p>What is important above all in the mid-term review is the actual target.  Are the targets the Minister set out earlier in the year for the delivery of various categories of social housing being delivered?  In June this year, the Minister said in answer to a parliamentary question that the targets for this year were as follows: the construction units target was 2,284, the voids target was 766, the regeneration target was 150, the acquisitions target was 1,250, the leasing target was 600, the rental accommodation scheme target 100 and the housing assistance payment was 1,500.  We know the HAP targets have been exceeded.  They went over that figure in the last HAP report.  Where are we now with all of these categories?  The social housing construction target was 2,284.  How many units have actually been constructed?  It would be great to know how many have been tenanted, because that is what really matters.  I have no wish to know about what is in the pipeline or in future at the moment.<\/p><p>The point is likewise with the void figures.  The Minister has doubled the void targets.  The figure has gone from 766 to 1,400.  Where did these other void come from?  This is one of the things I am trying to get my head around.  Does this relate to an extra 700 voids that local authorities have not declared?  Are these long-term voids that have not been declared?  Are these voids that should have been provided for next year and that have been brought forward to this year?<\/p><p>I am also confused by other figures.  Page 34 of the mid-term Estimates book includes housing figures.  The figure for the social housing current expenditure programme is 2,250.  How does that compare with the figure of 600 for leasing, which is funded through the expenditure programme, in the targets announced earlier by the Minister?  Are some approved housing bodies funded through the expenditure programme that are accounted for separately to the leasing figure?  What I really want to know related to the new social houses to be delivered this year.  How many have actually been delivered to date that have people living in them?  That is a useful thing to know.<\/p><p>Reference was made to Traveller accommodation.  Page 34 of the book refers to 90 units.  Again, we are far behind in terms of the drawdown from local authorities.  That is a problem at the local authority rather than at the Department.  What is being done to ensure the maximum level of drawdown by local authorities to meet their commitments under the Traveller accommodation programmes for this year?  How hopeful is the Minister that we will have a better drawdown at the end of this year than for next year?<\/p><p>My next question relates to next year's expenditure.  Can the Minister confirm some details?  I presume the &euro;50 million from local infrastructure housing activation fund has been rolled over and added to the &euro;25 million extra funding announced in the budget.  That would make the figure for LIHAF &euro;75 million in total for next year.  Will the Minister confirm that?<\/p><p>I am also confused because there was no mention in the budget announcement of &euro;25 million for affordable schemes.  However, in the Minister's press conference and press release he referenced &euro;25 million, some &euro;15 million of which was for next year for some kind of affordable schemes.  Is that new money?  Is it re-profiling something within the existing budget?  When does the Minister expect to announce all of that?<\/p><p>The next question is on rents and the housing assistance payment.  Neither the <i>daft.ie<\/i>nor the Residential Tenancies Board data indexes are thorough.  For example, I am on the RTB rental index, but the relevant figures relate to the rent that I signed up to when it entered my tenancy 11 years ago.  There is no obligation on my landlord to notify the RTB of the rent increases I have experienced.  That means there is an underestimation in the RTB index, just as there is probably an overestimation in the <i>daft.ie<\/i>index because it refers to asking rents.  I do not believe that means we can dismiss be <i>daft.ie<\/i>rent index, although that is my interpretation of what the Minister has done.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that one of the significant changes in the housing assistance payment policy is that by the end of Rebuilding Ireland we expect approximately 100,000 households to be on a housing assistance payment that is meant to be relatively permanent.  Rent supplement was always seen as an emergency payment for a short period.  Therefore, there is something significantly different about HAP.  We will have the largest ever number of households, according to the Government plan, on a rent subsidy by 2020 or 2021.  However, the design of the policy is to be long-term.  That raises further questions.  Is the Government saying that the policy is now beyond 2020?  Is the idea to move people off HAP and into council housing?  Is it the case that, as the legislation states, their housing needs will still be deemed to be met and they will remain permanently or indefinitely subsidised in the private rental sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E02000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>I will come back to the initial comments.  I have no wish to labour the issue, but Deputy &Oacute; Broin is absolutely right in that I have talked about international comparisons before in discussing homelessness.  My responsibility as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is to ensure that we have an objective analysis of policy and that our policy is based on fact.  For far too long in this country, policies were not evidence-based.  We look to other jurisdictions to try to get a better understanding of what exactly they are experiencing and why.  We want to know what they have done that has worked and not worked and what we can implement ourselves.  Let us consider the number of children who are homeless in Scotland.  It is double the amount that we have in this country.  The number of rough sleepers in the United Kingdom is 20 times the number of rough sleepers in this country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right in a way.  We should not get lost in the weeds talking about international comparisons.  One family in emergency accommodation is one family too many.<\/p><p>Every time we see a rough sleeper on the street, our responsibility is to help him or her to find secure, sustainable accommodation.  That is why we work with initiatives such as Housing First.  The voluntary sector, with which we work and fund, tells us the best way to help the homeless is to get them into a home first and then give them wrap-around supports.  That is why developed the hub programme.  It is a first response but a much better response than a hotel.  We knew we needed to do something for the families to ensure they had the right supports in place.  We are now seeing a couple of things with the hubs.  First, families feel much safer and happier in the them than in the hotels, which is very welcome.  Also, families are moving very quickly from hubs into other forms of sustainable accommodation.  We collect more accurate data than other countries, which is good, and we publish them monthly.  That shows our commitment to making sure we are not trying to hide this, downplay it or minimise it.  We believe we should focus on homelessness because we believe, as the Taoiseach said, it is a stain on our society.<br\/><br\/>There is evidence of policies working.  I have stated the figures before.  The number of families in hotels has decreased by 20% since the peak in March of this year.  In August and September, we saw more families exiting emergency accommodation than entering.  That is the first time that has happened in three years.  There are about 2,500 people who would be homeless today if it were not for the great work done by the voluntary sector with local authorities in exiting people from homelessness and preventing people from falling into homelessness.  While the rate of family homelessness is increasing nationally, as per the September figures, the rate actually halved in the three preceding months by comparison with the three months preceding those three months.  It is important to recognise, not just for the taxpayer, who is concerned about how we are using our resources to help these people, but also for the volunteers and workers who are doing the work, that some of these policies are working.  They are not working as quickly as I would like them to, however.  For this reason, we had a housing summit to meet local authorities to determine what new initiatives we could introduce.  Helping with prevention will be the Housing First national co-ordinator, whom we hope to announce and appoint next week, the exit co-ordinators, who represent an important preventive measure, some of the change management practices we will introduce in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and other changes.<br\/><br\/>On LIHAF, the 2018 allocation is &euro;70 million.  The overall envelope for LIHAF is ring-fenced out to 2019 and 2020.  It is after that period that LIHAF 2, involving the additional &euro;50 million, will kick in.  It will not be until 2019 and 2020 so it is not a question of LIHAF 2 coming in next year.  I have a detailed database on each of the projects I have signed off on under LIHAF and the ones I am waiting to approve.  The vast majority are already at design phase.  We have an idea as to what might be called upon when we do a second call for LIHAF 2.  All of the money will be drawn down and used, and it will open up thousands upon thousands of new homes.<br\/><br\/>With regard to HAP, the RTB and their data, we always deal with a number of different data sets.  One thing we are having difficulty with in looking at completions is getting the most accurate data set.  I do not dismiss the <i>daft.ie<\/i>data.  It recognises a trend upwards.  We see that also.  One of the things I want to do with the RTB, which I announced in September, was to move to a point where we could have annual registration of tenancies.  That way we will get more thorough data for the RTB and even better data sets.  The data we do have from the RTB for the first two quarters of the year show the rent inflation in the rent pressure zones is below 4%, which is more than half the rate in 2016.  That is reliable information and it is welcome.<br\/><br\/>The additional &euro;25 million for the affordability schemes, which will work on top of what we are doing in LIHAF, is new money.  It will be allocated over 2018 and 2019.  In the course of the next two or three weeks, we will finalise how the criteria for accessing the scheme will work.  This will be done in conjunction with the housing bodies and local authorities.  I hope to make an announcement on that but it will not delay any work in terms of getting the houses built.<br\/><br\/>I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to answer the question with regard to Traveller accommodation.<br\/><br\/>When we consider our voids programme, we note voids can be an easy win because they are vacant local authority stock.  What we have been trying to do is ramp up a programme of void conversions as much as possible and move to a programme of maintenance to prevent homes from becoming voids and give a quicker turnaround time.  We have asked the local authorities to advise us on their numbers of outstanding voids and derelict units.  We are going to fund about 1,400 of those this year, which probably means that, in later years as we look at the programme, there may be fewer voids as a result.  It is cheaper to get a void back into use and we can do it more quickly, so we want to target as many of those as possible in a given year.  Hence, there is a ramp-up for this year.<br\/><br\/>SHEP covers all our leasing, including mortgage to rent.  That would explain the higher target in the table referenced.  With regard to our build targets, 5,050 units are on track to be delivered for this year.  That would include the build target we have, which is to have 2,000 built by local authorities and housing bodies this year.  If there is some slack in one area, we will make up for it in another.  I will be in a better position to talk about this in January.  Things are looking promising in terms of the social housing targets we have for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#E02100","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>On the Traveller accommodation programme, the increased budget for last year was to try to provide 90 new units.

It has been a difficult area in which to achieve the spend.  It is a matter we have discussed in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere over recent years.  It is an area in which we want an improvement.  There is an increased budget for next year, an extra &euro;3 million.  That will put us in a position to provide more accommodation.  I am not happy about our expenditure in this area and all local authorities have a responsibility in this regard.  As members know, we had the review of the legislation and expenditure in this area.  We asked the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee to come forward with suggestions of names to work with us on an expert commission to determine how we can improve the situation and deal with the matter under the legislation to get the money spent.  I am concerned it is not targeting all the right areas.  Some local authorities are not pulling their weight.

I am looking forward to the committee working with us on that and in trying to make changes.

On the commentary on nothing being done, quoted by the Minister of State, Deputy English, I do not believe is the case.  It is the case that what is being done does not appear to be working, unfortunately.  That is the commentary.  The crisis is escalating and the figures bear that out.  It was poor judgment on the part of the Taoiseach to say what he said.  It is not just me saying that.  When one heard Fr. Peter McVerry on the radio earlier saying he was furious, one could imagine the views of those he helps and whom we want to help.<\/p> <p>  My question is similar to that of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I will try to make it as simple as I can in the hope the respective personnel and Minister will make the response as simple as they can.  With regard to capital expenditure of local authorities, by the beginning of November &euro;243 million was spent.  Was it purely on construction, or was the figure inclusive of purchases?  If both, could we have a breakdown?  How many houses were delivered?  Could I be told that if one figure is divided by the other, the cost of a house is &euro;150,000, for example?  How many houses are being delivered by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector based on the expenditure of &euro;75 million?<\/p> <p>  A figure of &euro;90 million was mentioned for other services.  That is quite a large figure to throw in under that heading.  I would like a breakdown of the other services.  I do not see the repair-and-lease scheme, for example.  Unfortunately, we know it has been a great failure.<\/p> <p>  Could I be told when the former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, announced LIHAF?  We need to learn from our past, even our recent past.<\/p><p>It has been 18 months to two years since that was initially announced, and not a penny has been drawn down on it.  I asked about that some months ago, and of course there were contracts being prepared and signed and so on.  Why is that the case?   What is the problem with it, that it has not borne fruit much more quickly, as was expected, so that we might make improvements as was done on the repair and lease scheme?  To bring it down to brass tacks, if the Minister can tell me that &euro;243 million was spent on the provision of social housing and a certain number of houses were delivered, that tells me how much it is costing.  &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance in Ballymun is acquiring State lands at &euro;1,000 per site and providing housing units for between &euro;140,000 and &euro;200,000.  That is affordable housing.  That is social housing.  That is delivery, and it should be replicated throughout the country, because if those figures are accurate, then that is the solution to our problem.  As an example of our problem, one hears of a site in County Meath that was bought some years ago at the height of the boom.  We are only getting half the potential units from it, because we are trying to recoup the costs of purchasing it some years ago.  There is nothing affordable or social about that policy.  I would like a breakdown of what we have delivered, and how much it costs to deliver each individual unit.  I thank the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#F00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As a brief reply to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, we can absolutely learn lessons from other countries.  That is why I think international comparisons are important.  Let us leave that part of the debate there.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cowen, the local infrastructure housing activiation fund, LIHAF, is an excellent initiative whereby we can use a relatively small amount of taxpayers' money to unlock very big housing sites, from which we will derive a Part 5 commitment from a developer and a cost reduction per-unit or its own little affordability scheme.  <\/p> <p>  However, some of the sites have a number of different owners.  They might be part locally-owned.  There might be different requirements in the local area.  Actually putting together contracts with the private side and with the local authority is not necessarily straightforward, but a huge amount of work has been done.  While money has not been drawn down yet, we are at design stage for many of these projects.  They know exactly what they are going to do.  Some money has been drawn down, albeit a small amount, and LIHAF is going to deliver thousands of new homes.  I have a detailed table of exactly what has been signed off and at what amounts, and if the Deputy wants to examine a couple of sites we can do that.  I can discuss how the money is being leveraged and what it might return. <\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the repair and leasing scheme before in regard to its effectiveness to date.  The scheme has received a total of 705 applications as of 9 November.  That is an increase of 32% on on the figure for the second quarter of this year.  Some 18 agreements to lease have been signed.  That is obviously a much smaller number than what we had hoped to achieve with the repair and leasing scheme this year.  As we have already spoken about, we recognised midway through the year that there were problems with the scheme that were making it unattractive for people to access, such as the length of time for which the lease agreement would have to be entered into.  We are finalising a new version of the repair and lease scheme which will be notified to all local authorities very shortly.  It will address those issues of concern that have made the scheme less attractive than it might have been.   The Department manages its budget in the total envelope.  As such, money that was not utilised under the repair and lease scheme was moved to other areas, such as homelessness services, where there were additional demands, for more hubs for example.  That is where the funding has gone.  However, where private vacancies are concerned, the repair and lease scheme will be an important tool to get more vacant homes back onto the market and in use for social housing.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to other services,  a sum of &euro;90 million includes &euro;70 million for some of the Housing Agency's acquisitions and &euro;20 million for the pyrite remediation scheme.  It funds some areas of housing research and also contributes to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  In regard to the 5,050 units to be delivered this year I would like to comment on the &Oacute; Cualann model.  It is a fantastic model, which is why I have met with them in my Department and we are trying to do something at a greater scale.  That is what I hope the &euro;25 milllion will go towards,  a model whereby the local authority can use local authority land sold at &euro;1000 or &euro;2000 euro per house, build a home and sell it via mortgage to a tenant much more cheaply than what might have been available.  For example, when I visited the &Oacute; Cualann scheme, I met a woman who had been paying something like &euro;1500 in rent and was now paying a mortgage of &euro;700.  That made an incredible difference to her life and her family life.  That is what we want to do and what we want to achieve with our affordability schemes.  <\/p> <p>  Over 1,000 local authority and housing body builds are complete at present, according to Q3 data, which will be released in the coming weeks.  There are more coming, obviously, because of the target numbers of direct builds, which we will hit before the end of the year.  For acquisitions, the target of 12,50 has been met; for leasing the target was 600, which has been met.  In regard to the Rental Accomodation Scheme, RAS, half the targets on Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, have been exceeded, and the RAS target is on track. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>Am I to take it, then, that 1,000 units have come from a spend of &euro;243 million?

A failed system will not work, no matter how much money is put into it.  I understand that the Minister is working and trying to sort out issues, but let us examine the RAS.  If someone is on the housing list and is in receipt of RAS, they are taken off the housing list.  If I have ten people in my clinic who are on the RAS, and I go to the local authority housing list to look for their names, they are not on it.  This happens to thousands upon thousands of people.  It is an absolute nightmare.  It is not working.  I have to say, in fairness to the Minister, he has been working with the HAP, but I have a major concern with it.  If someone gets onto the local authority housing list, they are automatically entitled to the HAP.<\/p><p>Many landlords will not take tenants on HAP which is causing serious concern for us because we are trying to see if landlords will take tenants on HAP - certain landlords do.  A person who had a mortgage whose house has been repossessed, who is no longer living there and is trying to find accommodation but whose name is still on the deeds cannot go on the housing list.  Years ago people could be on two local authority lists; they could get only one house but it gave them the flexibility.  A person living in Wicklow cannot be placed on the housing list in Carlow.  This is why people are becoming homeless.  We are coming across another type of homelessness that is not being addressed.<\/p><p> Carlow has one of the lowest income ceilings.  A person needs to be earning less than &euro;27,500 to go on the local authority housing list in Carlow.  The figure in the neighbouring counties of Laois and Wicklow is &euro;30,000.  That is the issue.  These are issues causing homelessness.  People who do not qualify should be given encouragement to get a mortgage because so many people do not qualify to get a mortgage through the banks and building societies, nor do they qualify to be on the local authority housing list.  This is the new homelessness.  These people are in no-man's land.<\/p><p> I was very disappointed about the rent-pressure zone areas.  Rent-pressure zone areas are crucial but because we have an emergency situation, every local authority should have qualified just until we got out of the housing crisis.  I understand it is not possible to leave them there all the time.  It is very hard for me to see my neighbouring county qualify for the rent-pressure zone area while we have the same issues but do not qualify.  That is where all the confusion is.<\/p><p> I welcome the initiative on the vacant houses, but the issue is with the timescale for getting them back to the local authority when they are ready to go.  We seem to be getting the same figures all the time.  I ask the Minister to put something in place.  There is no accountability in a local authority.  The Minister needs to move on these.  I welcome what is happening with these vacant houses, but they are coming back too slowly; there is too much red tape and it is not working out.<\/p><p> I have massive concerns about the 800 local authority new builds.  We need to build.  I know the Government has exceeded its targets on the HAP scheme.  Taxpayers' money is going to 15,120 new tenants to cover rent for accommodation that those people will never own.  These are the issues we need to consider.<\/p><p> I welcome the money the Minister has allocated for the housing adaptation grant.  Carlow got an additional &euro;500,000, which is marvellous.  People are living longer and that is the area that needs to be addressed most urgently.  Most people attending my clinic are looking for all this extra help because they actually cannot afford it.  It is great that the Minister is putting money into that.<\/p><p> I have picked the points where I feel the system is not working.  Local authorities need to be given more leniency and we need more accountability.  It is creating a new homelessness crisis.  The people I have highlighted are being forgotten.  I know the Minister will address it.  I ask the Department to consider these issues.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue of mortgages for people who are in no-man's land of being in work but not qualifying to go on the local authority housing list.  He should give them the chance and build houses.  I was not too hard on the Minister today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#G01800","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510741800,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>The Senator is absolutely right about the money allocated for adaptation grants.

If the private sector did not exist, this problem would be much worse.  There is something of a Hobson's choice in having to do that.  Being able to give flexibility to people to choose where they want to live but with State support and to be able to rent and not have to commit themselves to a 20, 30 or 40-year commitment works for some people but for many people it does not.  That is why we are focusing so much on building acquisitions and long-term leases to get people into secure sustainable tenancies.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about vacancy and accountability.  We need more transparency here.  Through transparency we get accountability.  That is why either next week or the week after I will publish targets and write to every local authority about what they will build next year so that the Senator, as a representative of her community, together with the councillors and everyone else can actually see what is meant to be delivered and can ask questions of the local authority as to what is happening week-in and week-out.  It is only by doing that, together with everything being transparent, that we can drive the kinds of results we will need to see next year.  I am quite confident that we will almost double our social housing build next year.<\/p> <p>  There was considerable debate about rent-pressure zones at the time and in the preceding years.  Someone previously said they were going to bring in rent caps or freeze rents.  It actually had an adverse effect on the market in that landlords moved to ratchet up rents before the freeze came in.  In other countries that brought in blanket measures on rent, it froze the market and resulted in some people paying very little rent when they could afford to pay much more while others were locked out of the rental market.  The two qualifying criteria for rent-pressure zones of looking back at four of the previous six quarters and the average rent across the country are sound.  As we come through each quarter, new areas fall into the rent-pressure zones.  Obviously there will be a spillover effect in where there is a rent-pressure zone and an area just outside it.  That is one of those unintended consequences of a policy that is introduced.  However, the RPZs are working and we will continue with that policy into next year.<\/p> <p>  Much of the Senator's contribution related to the affordability issue and she is right to highlight it.  We need to be careful not to make too quick a comparison to a new type of homelessness.  I recognise the difficulties people have in trying to pay high rents and save for a deposit.  I know people who have had to move back to their parents' homes either because they cannot afford the rent or in order to allow them to save for the deposit.  What they are experiencing is difficult for them and their lives.  It is a far cry from what people who are forced out of accommodation are experiencing.  We are being sensitive in how we talk about it.<\/p> <p>  For a long time people who qualified for social housing support got all this support from the State, but those who did not qualify felt almost abandoned.  We cannot be that black and white with our policies anymore; life is complicated.  Sometimes giving an individual a little bit of support can make a very big difference.  Under LIHAF 1 and LIHAF 2, on 70% of the sites two and three-bedroom houses will come in below a certain threshold.  However, on about 30% of the sites we will have affordable schemes whereby someone who does not qualify for social housing but who would not be able to afford a house on the market will be able to enter those homes on an affordable-to-buy or affordable-rent scenario.  That is what I will be announcing in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the additional &euro;25 million we announced in the budget is also for affordability schemes.  We look to something like the &Oacute; Cualann model in terms of co-operative housing and what the qualifying criteria were for people to be placed in those homes through the local authority.  We will consider something similar for those affordability schemes.  I return to a point Deputy Cowen made.  While Dublin City Council charged &Oacute; Cualann only &euro;1,000 a unit, the cost the council incurred was about &euro;70,000 per unit when servicing costs and everything else are taken into account.  There are not necessarily clean ways of calculating these things and we try to average them out.<\/p> <p>  We are reviewing the qualifying criteria in terms of thresholds for social housing supports.  We are also reviewing the incremental tenant purchase scheme.  Someone on HAP can transfer to another area, but only if transferring up.  Senator Murnane O'Connor mentioned that landlords did not like HAP.  We have experience of 23,000 or 24,000 landlords, some of them with multiple properties, working with the different agencies to help people into HAP tenancies.  HAP has been successful.  We have exceeded our HAP target this year.  While I understand why there might be difficult cases with individual landlords, the overall experience is that it works and that people are happy to engage in a HAP tenancy.<\/p><p>It is superior to previous programmes because there is the flexibility to go above the amounts and add 20%.  It is important that we have that option.  If we can learn from what we do and constantly review and analyse what is and is not working - I hope that is the approach I am taking to this brief - together with full transparency and accountability, with everything being published and everyone aware of our targets and what we are doing, we can improve the system and make it work for the people who are at the receiving end of it.  We have to make sure they are getting the support they should be getting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#H00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>I agree that there are very good landlords, but there are also landlords who do not want to accept the housing assistance payment.

Twenty years ago a family would have been given a home within three years.  Now children are eight or nine years old before they have an opportunity to live in their own home.  This is a huge hidden problem.  There is enormous pressure on those families who have to live in their parents' homes.

The other was the front room in which all of the children were living with their mother.  It did not make sense.<\/p> <p>  I want to praise the local authorities in County Louth.  I asked a question last week and will ask for the answer in a different way.  I may not get it today.  Despite the criticism, there is very good practice.  I am the first to criticise the county councils in Dublin which were offered 2,000 houses by NAMA, of which they took less than 1,000.  I have criticised Fingal County Council which was offered 270 houses by NAMA but took only 105.  It dismisses our figures for the numbers of unoccupied homes.  Louth County Council, however, is exceptional.  It has sourced social housing in abandoned or vacant properties.  I understand 50 units have been completed in this way this year.  If every council in the country were to do the same, it would make a huge difference.<\/p> <p>  With the support of Mayo County Council, the Minister rightly set up a vacant or empty homes website.  I read in the newspaper this morning that by September this year 10,000 queries had been made to the website.  Will the Minister comment on the efforts made by Louth County Council and do what he can to ensure other councils will do what it is doing so effectively?  It is one thing to turn the sod to build houses, but these are houses which are already available.  They have doors into which we can fit keys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy like to ask any question about water services which come under programme B?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I want to ask about why I was sacked from my job as Minister of State.

Last year &euro;140 million was earmarked for the completion of phase one and the start of phase two of the metering programme.  I understand it has been re-profiled in the overall capital spend, but Irish Water has not been able to give us an indication as to when that money will be spent.  Will it be spread out over the period 2018 to 2021 and will it be spent on something more specific?  Does the Minister have any information in that regard?  I am asking because there is a particular difficulty with wastewater treatment, not just in the 38 agglomerations covered by the European Commission's legal action in the European Court of Justice.  Why has the overall capital spend under the programme not changed on the back of the European Commission initiating legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice?  Has there been a movement of money to try to bring forward the investment to bring the 38 agglomerations up to speed to either reduce or minimise the impact of the legal action?  I am concerned because this applies to more than just the 38 agglomerations.  In its latest report the Environmental Protection Agency has detailed up to 100 locations around the country, in almost every county, where raw sewage is being pumped.  I know that there has been a change since last year in terms of the Minister's responsibility for this issue.  Much more responsibility has devolved to Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation, but given the fact that we are facing a legal action against the State rather than Irish Water, I presume that the Minister and his officials have a particular interest in ensuring the maximum level of investment to tackle the 38 sewage plants most at risk of causing pollution.  How is he dealing with that issue in the Estimates for next year and following years?<\/p> <p>  At the Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services one of the issues that arose was that the European Commission was very concerned that funding from central government for Irish Water could not be guaranteed in the longer term.  While the Minister and the Government have made verbal commitments, they are still subject to the budgetary cycle each year.  The Minister has made a commitment and I accept his bone fides in terms of the plan to meet both the need for direct investment and borrowing commitments year on year as per the business plan, but it is subject to agreement each year.  Some of us proposed that a way to get around this was for the State to enter into a legally binding ten-year service level agreement with Irish Water to ensure funding certainty which might allay some of the fears of the Commission.  That idea was not supported at the committee by Fine Gael, but I presume it is still an issue in the Minister's engagement with the Commission.  Is it something at which the Government is looking or considering to overcome that problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>On Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's points-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>Does the Minister miss the Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>He does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#J01600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>-----we use Louth County Council as an exemplar when we look at what we are trying to do in housing provision in other parts of the country.  It had an important role to play at the housing summit in September, at which it discussed the things it had done successfully such as the issuing of compulsory purchase orders.  <i>Vacanthomes.ie<\/i>is a website which is managed by Mayo County Council and it has been very successful in that people have been able to publicly identify a vacancy.<\/p><p>That allows us to determine whether properties are actually vacant.<\/p><p> In July we requested every local authority to appoint empty home units.

We gave local authorities in cities and large urban areas a target of reverting to us with more detailed data for their vacancy numbers by the end of October and every other local authority a target of providing the data by the end of the year.  On the back of that data we will be able to target vacant homes to try to bring them back into use.<\/p><p> There has been a debate on the actual number of vacant homes.  Different data sets and figures have been produced.  Various local authorities have begun to drill down into and examine them.  For example, when we inspected units Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had been told were vacant, they turned out to be businesses.  One needs to get on site.

An additional incentive was included in the budget by the Minister for Finance where work was needed to bring vacant homes back into use in the private market rather than as social housing.  The incentive provides for allowable expenses of &euro;5,000, the bridging part, to take advantage of the home improvement scheme.

I take his point about service level agreements being a way of achieving certainty on funding for Irish Water.  I have engaged with the commissioner on this matter.  The Water Services Bill will allow us to provide for the preparation of multi-annual strategic funding plans for Irish Water as part of a framework to ensure we will invest what we need to invest.  With Irish Water, we will be guided by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  It will be up to the Oireachtas on an annual basis to approve the allocation of funding.  That is an important role played by the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance and I are working to ensure our plans for the funding of Irish Water will be aligned with and reflected in his ten-year national investment plan.  This year the Cabinet noted the funding that would be required by Irish Water up to 2021.  It is my responsibility, in working with the Oireachtas, to deliver it.  It will be clear to everyone what is required from Irish Water on an annual basis in terms of the capital and current spend.  My obligation will be to deliver it each year and it will be for the Oireachtas to vote it through.<\/p> <p>  On wastewater treatment and action by the European Union, now that the questions about the future funding of Irish Water have been clarified and resolved in the Water Services Bill, we can embark on a programme of work to ensure we can upgrade and make the necessary investments.  We will do this while taking account of the EPA's reports and the requirements under the directive.  Separate from Irish Water, other subheads in the budget show an increase in funding for work related to water quality since last year.  Irish Water also has investments to make.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 Irish Water identified the potential for savings from the domestic metering programme to be used to fund work on priority non-domestic meter upgrades which would underpin the non-domestic revenue stream and the urgent provision of strategic water and wastewater infrastructure to enable priority development lands to be opened up.  The money will move into that area in so far as Irish Water's investments are concerned.<\/p> <p>  The changes to the funding model on the back of the Water Services Bill, the debate on which I hope will conclude in the Seanad this week, will not affect our capital investment in 2018.  It has been secured and will be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>I have three questions, the first of which is about rural and group schemes.

Many groups have approached me recently because they have been told that they do not qualify for the grant.  It is down to the amount of money they must find for a rural water scheme.  In the light of the current position, that is unfair.  People form a group and say they can come up with a certain amount of money, but they do not meet the criteria because they are told that the funding is not available.  Will there be a scheme to help those who need to qualify?  The current system is not working.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter.<\/p> <p>  Regarding water meters, I wish to ask about the first fix policy.  Under current legislation, everyone is entitled to a first fix, but something needs to be clarified.  What will be the cost of a second or third call-out?  What exactly does it mean?  What if someone has to keep ringing Irish Water about the same leaking pipe?  Irish Water will fix it but three weeks later the same pipe will start to cause hassle again.  Is it entitled to charge the person?  If someone keeps complaining about the same problem, it is like a first fix.  Will there be a standard charge - people are concerned about this issue - and what will it be after the first fix?<\/p> <p>  Having dealt with Irish Water a great deal recently, I must say it is good to deal with.  It reverts to me straightaway, emails me and follows up constantly.  It is important to recognise this.  My dealings with Irish Water have been good.  However, my question is important, as we do not want someone to get a bill for &euro;100 or &euro;150 after a first fix.  People do not have that money.  We all know how precious water is and that we must use it wisely and go by the guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K01900","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Pat Casey have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#K02000","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>I have two quick ones, the first of which is about problems with water quality.<\/p><p>There seems to be significant underspend in capital investment and perhaps the Minister will explain this to me, in light of the number of areas where we are breaching EU regulation.

I am aware of how the excellent work they have done over many years in communities up and down the country was, perhaps, lost in the whole debate we have had on Irish Water and water generally in recent years.  When water charges for domestic customers of Irish Water were suspended, the group water schemes went back to their pre-2015 subsidy levels.  Engagement has already begun on a semi-formal basis with the federation as to how we make up for the difference during the period of time when we suspended the provision of the money.  We will formalise our engagement once the Bill comes out of the House so we can ensure we make up any money that was lost as a result of the suspension of the scheme but also that we look at the equity of treatment, to which the Deputy referred, which is also in the joint committee's report.  That work will begin next week or the week after, once the Bill comes out of the Seanad.  We spend approximately &euro;20 million on the subsidies, but another &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million, or a little higher, will be the cost of bringing the subsidies up to previous levels given the changes being made as a result of the Water Services Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Vote next year will cover Irish Water's obligations under the service level agreements, SLAs, with the local authorities.  Next year will look a lot different because of the changes we will make on motor tax, the local property tax and the local government fund.  There will be a much clearer funding stream into Irish Water so it will be easier to navigate in so far as the accounts are concerned.  As per the commitment I gave on Committee and Report Stages of the Water Services Bill, we are trying to expedite consideration with the Minister for Finance on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us greater oversight of the audited accounts of Irish Water.  There is obviously a role here for the Commission of Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in terms of regulating and overseeing the costs incurred, even with the SLAs entered into with local authorities.  If a new agreement is reached, in so far as 2021 is concerned, the saving anticipated at present is approximately &euro;1 billion.  It is not intended to impact service delivery.  It is intended to improve service delivery from the economies that can be achieved by doing this at an earlier timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#L00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>Is that &euro;1 billion over a period of years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017111500002#L00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510741800,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>It is the 2014 to 2021 business plan period.

The franchise section effectively becomes an electoral commission once a referendum, a presidential or, indeed, a general election is called.  The funding that was allocated in the figures for last year principally concerns the fact that there was a court challenge to the outcome of the children's referendum in 2012.  The bill of costs was budgeted for in anticipation that it would be presented but that has not happened yet.

I am accompanied by Ministers of State Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan and Department officials Mr. John McCarthy, Ms Mary Hurley, Ms Maria Graham, Ms Lorraine O'Donohue, Mr. David Walsh, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 Revised Estimate for my Department was published last December and was considered in select committee last March.  That Estimate is now being revised to do two things: first, to take account of the transfer of community functions from my Department to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development, under the leadership of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring; and second, to reflect the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refund of water charge payments made by domestic customers.<\/p> <p>  I will take the community transfer element first.  On 14 June 2017, the Taoiseach announced his intention to establish a new Department to undertake responsibilities in relation to rural and community development matter, to be led by Deputy Michael Ring.  This has resulted in the transfer of community-related functions from my Department and of associated spending subheads from its Vote.  The two community business units which have transferred to the new Department cover: community and voluntary supports and programmes, and social inclusion and communities.<\/p> <p>  These business units have a budget of &euro;77.5 million for 2017, including administration costs.  The transfer comprises a total of &euro;67 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.5 million in capital expenditure, together with appropriations-in-aid amounting to &euro;6.3 million.  I have circulated with my statement a table that summarises the financial transfers, which in accordance with established practice cover all spending in the areas concerned in the full year 2017.<\/p><p>In addition, the relevant staff implementing these programmes have moved to work in the new Department.<\/p><p> Moving on to the funding for Irish Water, the new Estimate for 2017 also reflects the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and the planned refunds to domestic customers.  The Water Services Bill 2017, currently in the Seanad, provides for the repeal of the 2014 domestic water charging regime and introduces a new programme focused on the promotion of water conservation, under which a levy will apply in certain circumstances for usage of water above a reasonable threshold.  In making these changes, provision is made in the Bill for the extinguishing of liabilities under the current regime and the making of refunds to the 990,000 customers who paid in accordance with the 2014 Act.  This will give rise to a new funding model for Irish Water which is underpinned by the Bill.  The Bill thus reflects the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which were adopted by both Houses last April.  Accordingly, a provision of some &euro;293 million for payment to Irish Water has been made in the Revised Estimate, in programme B - water services.  This figure includes the &euro;173 million needed to pay refunds to the 990,000 domestic customers.  There are also administrative costs associated with the refund process, estimated to amount to almost &euro;5.9 million.  A further &euro;114 million is being provided to cover the additional funding required by Irish Water arising from the extension of the suspension of domestic water charges to the end of 2017.<\/p><p> In conclusion, following the transfer of community functions and the making of the new provisions for Irish Water, the gross budget for my Department in 2017 now stands at &euro;1.995 billion.  Taking into account the changes in those two programme areas, this represents an increase of &euro;215 million on the Revised Estimate published last December.  I am of course happy to discuss the details with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#A00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I know it is too late to change this but some of us have a concern that the transfer of the final bits of community out of his Department, particularly those that relate to community development functions within urban local authority areas, could have a detrimental impact on the delivery of those services.  I am aware that ultimately, that is not a decision for the Minister or his Department.  I wish to put on record, however, that a lot of us would have preferred to see those functions remain in the Department that deals with local government, particularly because they are now also tied up with the local community development committees and the social inclusion committee activation programme.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates basically have three elements: The transfer of the funds for those final remaining bits of community from the Minister's Department to the other Department; the additional funding for refunds; and the funding for Irish Water for this year.

I know that is what he has just said, but I would like it to be very clear.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the additional money for the refunds and for the funding of Irish Water, can the Minister confirm the source of that funding?

We both deal with local authorities.  Local government comes under my Department but given the role that the Minister, Deputy Ring, has in the new Department, local authorities will be key to that.  We have a very close working relationship.  In any transfer of functions there is always some difficulty; whenever a new Department is being set up it takes a bit of time.  Staff have to relocate.  All of that sometimes creates delays or difficulties but we are doing our best to make sure that we work together and that there will be minimal disruption to any funds or activities that are transferring from my Department out that of the Minister, Deputy Ring.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's questions about what we are doing with the Revised Estimate, yes, it is about transferring the funding, staff and responsibilities for community into the new Department.  It is also providing those amounts for the payments of refunds to be made, the administrative costs for those payments and the additional money that must be expended because of the continued suspension of water charges for this year, which was not previously allocated.  As for where the money is coming from to do that, it is additional Exchequer funding that is available.  In other words, it is taxpayer funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#B00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comment on the transfer of the community function.  Although we will not have responsibility for the new Department there may be a role for this committee to invite in the Minister, Deputy Ring, maybe once a year or so, to discuss the management of those elements.  The only reason I am saying this is since the restructuring of the old community development programmes from Pobal by the former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, they are much more integrated into the local authority structure and policy.<\/p> <p>  We had a very interesting discussion here yesterday about rates.  Part of the difficulty with rates is that they are split between two Departments, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Justice and Equality.  When we are trying to discuss policy and potential reform that creates some difficulty.  I am concerned that the case might be similar here.  That might be something we could address.<\/p> <p>  While I am aware the sources of the funding referred to derive from revenue, what we would like to know is what part of the revenue pot they come from.  Clearly, there were areas of underspend in the Estimates that were allocated for the Departments this year.  It would be good to identify those elements of underspend that allowed the Government to transfer this money across to deal with the water situation.

The staff are now to be transferred in the year 2021.  The original plan was that they would be transferred over at a later date, I think it was 2026 although I stand to be corrected on that.  It is happening five years before it was originally planned.  I am concerned that this has implications for those workers in terms of their pay and pensions.  The official line is to say it will not make any difference.  However, the experience of workers who have been transferred from State to semi-State bodies in the past has been that there were implications for pay and pensions.  Any telecom worker will give the Minister the lowdown in that regard.  Will the Minister indicate who made the decision to speed up the transfer?  When was that decision made?

I have plenty of experience in my own constituency of pensioners having received phone calls from Irish Water putting them under pressure to pay, even if it was only a fiver, so as to avoid penalties.

Obviously, service level agreements were put in place.  These originally went to 2025, not 2026.  Irish Water has come together as a single utility for the country and is working with the local authorities.  It has been bringing in staff from local authorities and maintaining agreements with individual local authorities.  It has taken on assets and is improving them and improving our water infrastructure.  Irish Water has seen the possibility of expediting that.  The potential savings that would accrue to the body and to the State as a result would be potentially &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  When Irish Water consulted me on whether it should pursue this, I agreed that it should but I was very clear in my conversations with it that this would only work if it could be done in agreement with the staff in terms of making sure that people were happy that there would be no diminution of their salary or pension benefits.  No decision has been made but this is something we are progressing to see if we can do it.  We have a piece of work ongoing in NewERA to make sure that benefits such as pensions would be safe because that is essential if this is to be successful.  That piece of work is happening at present under the Water Services Act.  We have not come to a conclusion on it, but we are doing this with the utmost care and consultation with the relevant people involved to make sure that they understand exactly what is being proposed and that we can all be certain that there will be no negative effect on pay, conditions and pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#C00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Water Services Bill is being debated in the Seanad and I hope it will be completed this week.  As we now have an understanding of the role of Irish Water in the coming years, I hope that as the Oireachtas, we try to support that work and help Irish Water do its important work for citizens, whether they marched or did not march or paid or did not pay their water charges.  Irish Water has a job of work to do and it needs our support.<\/p> <p>  Having worked with Irish Water for the past six months, having visited the premises and met the staff - I met the staff on site in Drogheda and in other parts of the country - the staff of Irish Water need our support.  The brand \"Irish Water\" has been damaged since its inception and we have to help the staff of Irish Water to do their job effectively for the benefit of everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017111500002#C01000","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>I must respond briefly to the comments of Deputy O'Dowd and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.

I will make some brief introductory remarks and then hand over to Ms Elizabeth Farries, who will deal with the substance of the submission we have made.  The committee will have already received a joint written submission submitted jointly by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Digital Rights Ireland, which made a presentation to the committee last week.<\/p> <p>  As many of the members are aware the Irish Council for Civil Liberties is Ireland's leading independent human rights organisation.  It monitors, educates and campaigns in order to secure full enjoyment of human rights for everyone.  Founded in 1976 by Kadar Asmal and Mary Robinson and others, the ICCL has played a leading role in some of the most successful human rights campaigns over the past 40 years.  These have included campaigns on police reform, the legalisation on divorce, children's rights, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the introduction of enhanced equality legislation.<\/p> <p>  In the area of information rights, the ICCL has previously given submissions to the 2016 commissioned review of Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2009.  We have previously pursued privacy rights litigation with our colleagues from the United Kingdom, Liberty, at the European Court of Human Rights regarding the UK's surveillance systems.<\/p> <p>  We appeared before the European Court of Human Rights again last week in a case also involving an alliance of international organisations concerning the UK's continuing systems of mass surveillance today.  We are also a member of an international network of civil liberties organisations, which includes 13 independent human rights organisations from the global north and global south, including, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union, which works together to promote fundamental rights and freedoms, and has identified digital information and privacy rights as central to its mandate.  It is one of the most pressing international human rights issues facing human rights activists around the world today.<\/p> <p>  We affirm also the primacy of European law underpinning our submissions.  Data retention and disclosure legislation must be compatible with applicable EU law as it is interpreted in light of express guarantees in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  At stake in this matter is our right to privacy guaranteed by Article 7, the protection of personal data guaranteed by Article 8, and the freedom of expression and information guaranteed by Article 11.<\/p><p>The independent review commissioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality gave recommendations that also affirm EU and European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, law.  The former Chief Justice Mr. John Murray headed the review, and refers in his report to two key judgements by the European Court of Justice.  The first of these is the case of Digital Rights Ireland <i>v. <\/i>The Minister for Communications.  That challenge, which was against the data retention regime in Ireland, was referred by the Irish High Court to the European Court of Justice, and resulted in the invalidation of Directive 2006\/24\/EC, the EU Data Retention Directive.  The second judgement to which he refers is the judgement of the European Court of Justice in the case of Tele2 Sverige AB <i>v.<\/i>Post-Och Telestyrelsen<i>,  <\/i>which, building on the Digital Rights Ireland decision, sets out strict and binding standards which must be met to make any national system of data retention permissible under EU law and under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. <br\/><br\/>We welcome the general scheme of this Bill.  We are fully in support of the recommendations of the Murray review.  We offer these submissions in order to ensure that the recommendations in the Murray review can be fully implemented, and in our written submission we identify a number of key areas where we feel that the Bill, at this heads of Bill stage, currently does not fully meet the requirements of the recommendations. <br\/><br\/>I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Elizabeth Farries, who will address the key substantive points which we raise in our written submission. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1382,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the committee for giving me an opportunity to speak today.  To that end, and in response to our discussions last week, I have summarised some key recommendations drawing from our written submissions, which the committee received and we discussed last week.  There is a lot to cover.  At the core of this discussion is the explicit protection of journalistic sources.  I will leave that to the words of Mr. Seamus Dooley when he speaks, but I note at the outset that we absolutely advocate implementing the Murray review recommendations in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the issue of strict necessity, Ms Geraldine Moore said last week that the system of data retention and access, as laid out in the Bill, is most balanced, proportionate and fair.  However, as Deputy Jack Chambers noted, and as per the decision in Tele2, proportionality in this instance is insufficient.  As per Tele2, a ministerial order for data retention should only be made where strictly necessary.  Under the scheme of the Bill, heads 5 and 6, detailing these ministerial orders, fail to meet that strict standard.  They instead apply the weaker standard of proportionality, and that is incompatible with the standard laid out in Tele2.<br\/><br\/>The next subject is targeted data retention.  It was noted last week that the finding in Tele2 limits legislation to<b><\/b>require that data retention be based on targeted and objective evidence.  This limitation does not appear to be implemented under the heads of Bill.  Heads 5 and 6, for example, give a largely unfettered power to make rules requiring general traffic and controlled data retention.  The language in the Bill allows access to data that is &quot;likely to assist&quot;, as opposed to requiring objective evidence that &quot;reveals a link&quot; with serious criminal offences.  As a result, it falls significantly short of the standard set in Tele2<i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Now we have the issue of limited third-party access.  Last week, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan posited that provision for safeguarding the security of the State might be used against people in the political sphere, or people not directly connected to a crime, for example financial officers.  Mr. Dermot Woods said that this would not be the case.  However, it could be a problem for third-party access.  Head 8 permits access to data of entirely unconnected third parties, again on the more permissive grounds that the data is &quot;likely to assist&quot; in protecting the State.  This permissive stance clashes with EU law.  To uphold the requirements of Tele2<i>, <\/i>the person whose information is demanded must in some way, again, be implicated in a crime.  They cannot simply be a third party. <br\/><br\/>That leads to the larger discussion about the precision of how we define data.  Ms Moore said last week that there were no final decisions made about what specific categories of data might be the subject of ministerial orders.  That said, it was clarified for Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that, as per head 3, the Bill does not apply to the content of communications.  It is only meant to apply to the data around it.  However, under head 1, as the scheme of the Bill is written currently, &quot;traffic and location data&quot; is given an exceptionally wide and substantially more permissive definition that might inadvertently include the content that the Bill is supposed to be setting aside.  It includes any &quot;data processed for the purpose of sending, receiving or storing communications&quot;.  This definition is so permissive that it could conceivably permit ministerial orders to require Internet Service Providers, ISPs, to log Uniform Resource Locators, URLs.  A URL is not in and of itself &quot;content&quot;, but it often reveals the content of a web page, for example a news article that someone is reading.  That goes beyond the remit of the Bill as defined.  <br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of notification.  Last week, the need for proper notification was raised.  The Chair commented that surely people in Ireland must be entitled to know when our data is being accessed.  The response last week was that a person would automatically be informed if their data was disclosed.  We respectfully submit that this is not the case.  Under head 15 of the Bill there are a range of exemptions for notification, include a vague catch-all at subhead 2(a), where notification would not be &quot;consistent with the purposes for which the authorisation or approval concerned was issued or granted&quot;.  This is very vague.  It creates a lot of leeway around who gets to know their data is being looked at and who does not.  We therefore urge that notification in this context means fully upholding the requirements of Tele2<i>, <\/i>that those whose data is retained must be notified as soon as possible, that is, as soon as it is not liable to jeopardise an investigation. <br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of judicial remedies.  Deputy Mick Wallace posed a question that we had not addressed in our submissions, but one which is very important, and that is why the Bill does not have a judicial remedy.  The Murray review recommends one, and this is a principle supported by EU legislation and the European Court of Human Rights.  We understand that the Minister is getting advice on this matter, and to this advice we add our recommendation that a judicial remedy should absolutely be implemented.  As former Chief Justice Murray wrote, it is necessary &quot;bearing in mind the coercive character of a data retention system, and the concomitant risk to fundamental rights associated with it&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Last week, Deputy Wallace also queried why the Bill has not, as per the Murray review, instituted a robust independent supervisory authority.  In response, we heard that the Bill went with what was previously in place, which was said to be working quite well.  That is to say a designated judge of the High Court was charged with oversight and all was well.  We also heard that each year the judge examines the use of powers under the legislation in a detailed way, and so could very quickly identify if there was a problem, including any acts of abuse.  We respectfully submit that this has not been the case, and that the overview system has not worked very well at all.  In fact, as a Deputy<b><\/b>recalled for us, there are not detailed examinations each year.<br\/><br\/>Instead there have been annual reports, which have exclusively consisted of a few formulaic paragraphs which are put together very quickly, without any formal processes in place.  It is our submission that this is not a sufficiently detailed examination.  We further argue that a judge alone does not have sufficient resources, or even competence, to exercise comprehensive control over State surveillance.  The oversight role at this stage is described as &quot;<i>ad hoc<\/i>, after the fact, part-time function of a busy judge with no staff, specialist training or technical advisors&quot; in Privacy International and Digital Rights Ireland's report, entitled The Right to Privacy in Ireland  - Stakeholder Report Universal Periodic Review 25th Session &ndash; Ireland.  The judge, therefore, is at risk of becoming over-reliant on the feedback from the agencies that they are supposed to be overseeing.  They need the agencies to tell them everything is all right so they can sign off on it.<br\/><br\/>Generalist judges cannot on their own be expected to have the sort of specialist knowledge necessary to assess the technological complexities in a surveillance system.  As surveillance becomes rapidly more technologically complex, it changes, year-to-year and month-to-month.  Judges increasingly lack the specialist knowledge needed to provide adequate oversight.  We want Ireland to keep up with the trend of EU member states, and to do that we recommend replacing the designated judge with a unified independent supervisory agency.  We recommend that this independent agency should include parliamentary accountability.  According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which put a 2017 report out following its 2015 report, Ireland and Malta are currently the only two countries in the EU that do not provide for parliamentary oversight of intelligence agencies.<\/p><p>We also recommend that the independent body be chaired by a judge in a nearly full-time position, and be supported by a secretariat with a sufficiently technical expertise needed to make the decisions required in these instances.  They need the resources to provide detailed support, including formalised reports available to the public.  There are examples in the EU where these more fulsome aspects of intelligence agency oversights are included.  We address this need at length in pages ten to 14  of our written submission to the committee.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for giving the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, the opportunity to speak with it today.  We have other recommendations itemised in the written submission, and summarised in a list that may be before the members.  If it is not then I will circulate it to members after the meeting.  We hope to have the opportunity to speak with the committee more generally about the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Farries","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Farries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#C00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510736400,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address the committee as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  I know that the committee members are busy legislators.  The National Union of Journalists, NUJ, shares many of the concerns of ICCL and Digital Rights Ireland.  I do not propose to reiterate much of what has been said.  We especially share the concerns around the definition issue and the importance of providing adequate resources to ensure there is a digital oversight regime that is something more than a mere pretence at oversight.<\/p> <p>  This Bill has profound implications for journalists and for media organisations.  The NUJ believes that the highest level of protection, under both Irish constitutional and international law, must be afforded to journalists in respect of privacy in their communications.  The media plays a crucial role in maintaining accountability and transparency in the workings of civic society in a democratic state.  Where the rights of the media are undermined the ability of journalists to shine a light into the darkest corners are severely curtailed.  While there is an individual right of privacy afforded to citizens, the rights afforded to journalists in the exercise of their professional function are different and are rooted in a public good that extends beyond the individual rights of citizens.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme of the communications (data retention) Bill 2017 does not make adequate provision for the protection of sources or afford the level of judicial oversight recommended by Mr. Justice John Murray in his review of the legislative framework, as pointed out earlier.  In the terms of reference for the review Mr. Justice Murray was asked to take into account the principle of protection of journalistic sources, the need for statutory bodies with investigative\/and or prosecution powers to have access to data in order to prevent and detect serious crime, and current best international practice in this area.  The committee will be aware that Mr. Justice Murray found that current data retention legislation amounts to mass surveillance of the entire population of the State and recommended a series of changes to the current statutory framework, which he found was in breach of European law.  The former Chief Justice came up with an unambiguous statement in this regard.  The general scheme of the Bill before the committee sets aside the key recommendations of Mr. Justice Murray, and this is as concerning as it is curious.  In scrutinising the proposed legislation I respectfully suggest that the committee have due regard to the recommendations of Mr. Justice Murray.<\/p> <p>  The NUJ welcomed the establishment of the Murray review in January 2016.  In establishing the review the Minister announced that it would be completed within three months.  In October 2016 the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald advised the NUJ that the report was at an advanced stage.  The report was presented by Mr. Justice Murray in April 2017 but published in October 2017.  Perhaps this timeline tells its own story about the urgency with which this issue has been treated.<\/p> <p>  The fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality published the Murray review and the general scheme of the Bill simultaneously is a clear acknowledgement that the two are interlinked and my comments today are predicated on the NUJ's submission to Mr. Justice Murray, which I have provided to the committee.  The events leading to the establishment of the review provided a context to our submission.  The NUJ was gravely concerned at revelations in January 2016 that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, had authorised its investigators to demand access to the mobile phone records of two NUJ members on foot of its powers under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, exercised in the context of a disclosure request for telephone records made under section 6 of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011.<\/p> <p>  We met with the Minister for Justice and Equality and with GSOC and raised our concerns with both.  In the case of GSOC we had a robust but respectful exchange of views on general principles.  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 covers the retention and storage of historic data pertaining to all electronic communication, including fixed line and mobile telephone, internet communication and text messages.  It is being done without the consent of those affected.  As Mr. Justice Murray has pointed out, the arrangement is indiscriminate in application and scope, affecting the retention and storage of journalists&rsquo; communications data pertaining to the time, date, location and frequency of a journalist&rsquo;s telephone calls and can thus identify sources.  Location data linking a journalist's telephone calls with those of another caller before or after a sensitive meeting in which that person was known to have been involved can fatally compromise confidential sources of information, including from whistleblowers, and it was in this context that the NUJ expressed particular concern at the actions of GSOC.  The Minister subsequently announced the Murray review.  The NUJ&rsquo;s approach to the protection of sources is firmly rooted not just in journalistic ethics but in international conventions.  Our submission to the Murray review is included in our submission to the committee.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that head 18 of the Bill makes provision for a High Court judge to keep the operations of the provisions of the Bill under review.  Committee members will perhaps understand a degree of scepticism on our part against the backdrop of the decision not to incorporate key recommendations of the former Chief Justice into the new legislation.  There is an irony in having a provision in a scheme to review, by a High Court judge, a Bill that ignores the recommendations of a former Chief Justice who was appointed by the Minister who then introduces a new Bill with lesser provisions and will get a judge to review it.<\/p> <p>  The NUJ suggests that the communications (retention of data) Bill 2017 should incorporate the recommendations on journalistic sources made by Mr. Justice Murray.  For ease of reference I have included those recommendations in my submission to the committee but I do not propose to read them into the record.  They are recommendations Nos. 231 to 237, inclusive, from the Murray report.  It is welcome that Mr. Justice Murray recognises that the protection of journalistic sources is of vital importance to journalists in the exercise of their professional activities and the attention of the committee is drawn, in particular, to his recommendation that any exception which permits the identification of journalistic sources or which might oblige a journalist to disclose them should be subject to prior control by a judicial or independent administrative authority.  Mr. Justice Murray recommends that applications be made to a High Court judge.  The designation in the scheme of a judge of the District Court, or a panel of District Court judges acting as authorising judges, seems to me to reflect an overall view in this scheme that is not welcome.  In a sense this decision is reflective of the low priority given under the general scheme to the recommendations of Mr. Justice Murray.  In publishing the general scheme the Minister for Justice and Equality acknowledges that while there are problems with the current legislation it is not unconstitutional.  This appears to set a low bar indeed.  The current legislation in regard to the protection of sources is in conflict with the European Court of Human Rights and demonstrably undermines the fundamental rights of journalists.  One should not approach a new piece of legislation by saying that we do not believe the current legislation is unconstitutional.  It should not be the case that a journalist or any other citizen should have to go to the Supreme Court to vindicate their rights.  The Minister has ignored the recommendation of the designation of a supervisory authority to ensure the legislation is not abused.  This is also regrettable.<\/p> <p>  The NUJ shares many of the concerns expressed by Digital Rights Ireland, which has done so much work in this area, and the ICCL whose record needs no acknowledgement from me.  In particular, we share the concern that the general scheme does not reform the structure for oversight of data retention and does not comply with EU law.<\/p><p>Head 22 seeks to abolish the current power of the complaints referee to award compensation to individuals whose data has been accessed in contravention of the legislation.<\/p><p> There is urgent need for legislative reform in this area. In regard to the issues of specific concern to the National Union of Journalists we believe the report of Mr Justice Murray provides a framework for meaningful reform.  We respectfully suggest that that framework is not adequately provided in the scheme before the members this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1387,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dooley.

The responsibility is on that body to control that data appropriately, to treat it with integrity and to not allow it to be disseminated in a way that would be unlawful or potentially prejudicial or damaging to the rights of individuals.  That is the other side of the question.  To return to Deputy O'Callaghan's earlier question, we must, when assessing the question of proportionality and restricting appropriately the circumstances and the type of data which can be retained, be mindful of the potential risk of misuse of data.  Unfortunately, in recent years we have had a number of very damaging instances where State agencies that had lawfully retained data of a very broad nature have then disseminated or failed to control that data.  That is the context here.  We can look at it from the point of view of unethical journalistic behaviour.  The more central issue is that a State agency which has data of the most serious kind, that potentially violate individual rights, has been very loose and casual about how that data is shared.  That is the data retention point which goes to the type of tight controls and oversight we are calling for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>The witness is talking about circumstances where the State's use of that information, in terms of Garda information, was leaked.

It is a difficult one.  We represent full-time professional journalists, people who make their living as journalists and adhere to the code of conduct.  I would be opposed to an academic qualification and some form of a limit on the profession because it is important that there is a diversity of voices.  A full-time professional journalist who makes his or her living from journalism is as near as I can go to a definition.  I would be very reluctant to have a situation where who is or is not a journalist was prescribed by the law.

Does he have to make an appointment?  Does a journalist telephone a person, saying that it is believed that the person is guilty of wrongdoing and that he or she wants to talk to the individual about it and could he or she come and see the individual?  Journalism does not work that way.  Journalists must make an ethical decision that the right to invade privacy is in the public interest.  It must be an overriding public interest that one cannot get the information required in any other way.

I suppose I would broadly accept the fact that there is a specific role for journalists in terms of public debate, a democratic society and all the rest.  The difficulty that we will face is that the heads of a Bill are in line with the proposal from the ICCL and from the NUJ that as it stand, the Bill is inadequate in terms of protecting journalistic sources and the right to protect sources.  If that is to be changed we will need to find a precise wording, a precise formulation.  I think we will need some guidance on this.  There will have to be some kind of definition of who will benefit from that specific protection.  I appreciate the point that Mr. Dooley made about not supporting a system of specific accreditation, as exists in France.  I am not familiar with the system.  How has EU <i>juris prudence <\/i>dealt with providing some kind of definition or clarity as to who is a journalist and the category of people who specifically benefit from that kind of enhanced protection?

I mentioned France because it is the only country in Europe of which I am aware that has a licensing system.

That purpose is above and beyond the purpose of somebody else.<\/p> <p>  The court has never recommended for instance that there should be a system of registration or a definition of journalists.

As Ms Farries has mentioned, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights has done a comprehensive analysis of how the various models used in member states operate.  As a practical measure, it is worth reflecting on.  Where parliamentary committees have specific competence in relation to matters of national security and surveillance, etc., they typically operate in a manner that is different from other parliamentary committees.  Members might be familiar with the operation of security committees in the Westminster Parliament or in the US parliamentary system.  Members of those committees are subject to special security clearance standards and special protections.  The secrecy and privacy restrictions on the operation of such committees differ from the standard restrictions.  If we go down this road, it is likely that the committee will have to operate in a manner that differs from the operation of existing parliamentary committees here.  There are plenty of models from other jurisdictions - both common law and civil law countries - where committees of this type have operated.  It is now the norm that there should be such a committee, but it might require a different approach here from what we do more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017111500002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>In its Bill, the Government has ignored many of the Murray recommendations.

We have been speaking a lot about protecting journalists and suggesting they are a separate group.  We need to be more precise in our language.  I am as guilty in this regard as anyone.  The protection that exists in law is a protection of the confidentiality of journalists' sources.  That confidentiality and protection is not there for the benefit of journalists because they are journalists; it is there to protect the source in the same way that legal professional privilege is there to protect the confidentiality of the client, not the lawyer.  We do a disservice to the debate and to journalists to treat them as a separate group who should be given separate protection.  That is not the point, rather it is about protecting their sources.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I ask one question of the ICCL.  Deputy Wallace asked the ICCL why other legally protected rights should not be recognised in the legislation and one can use the examples of doctors or lawyers.  Legal professional privilege is recognised at European Court of Human Rights level.  It is not mentioned in the Bill and I do not think journalists are mentioned in it either.  Why not, given the point that Deputy Wallace raised?

I look forward to working with the new committee in the next few years.  I wish the Chairman and members well and I hope we can work together for the betterment of rural Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the select committee my Department's Revised Estimate for 2017.<\/p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development was established on 19 July 2017.  The decision to establish the Department is an important one for rural and urban communities throughout Ireland.  It underlines the Government's commitment as set out in detail in chapter 4 of A Programme for a Partnership Government, that is, to ensure that the economic recovery can be felt by every community and that we build greater resilience for the future.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s focus over the past two programmes for Government has been on recovery.  This focus has paid off.  There is no doubt the economy is experiencing the kind of growth we had hoped for.  The reduction in the unemployment rate demonstrates how much has been achieved.  The Taoiseach has also been referring more recently to creating a republic of opportunity for all citizens.  The challenge is to ensure that the opportunity is experienced by everyone.<\/p><p>At the national level, the data show the extent of the recovery.  However, as is clear from the Pobal report I launched last week, the picture is more complex when we go below the national, or even the regional, level.  At local level, we can see that the recovery was not even.  Some communities were hit harder by the recession while some have recovered much more slowly than others.  That is the challenge I believe that I have been set - to support communities, especially those in rural areas and those who experience disadvantage, to have an equal chance of experiencing the recovery.<\/p><p>The opportunity and challenge for the new Department is to ensure that the consolidation of key policy, supports and programmes makes a difference.  The first task is to ensure the Department&rsquo;s own programmes of investment support local communities through projects they have identified as priorities.  These projects, they believe, will support job creation, attract tourism investment and contribute to quality of life in their areas.  The second priority is to ensure that communities are vibrant and sustainable, that individuals have voices and that they have choices.  The third priority is to ensure that the community and voluntary sector are supported to continue to contribute to social cohesion.  We have a unique asset in our communities, we and volunteers across the whole country want to promote and enhance the social fabric.  I have a cross-Government mandate to ensure that the policies introduced by Government support growth regionally and locally, and help to sustain communities no matter where people choose to live.<\/p><p>The further Revised Estimate before the select committee today sets out my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2017.  Gross expenditure of almost &euro;163 million is budgeted for my Department this year.  This represents an increase of 21% on the provision in 2016 for similar programmes.  The Department&rsquo;s current expenditure provision for 2017 is &euro;85.72 million.  The total capital provision for 2017 is &euro;76.9 million.<\/p><p>Turning to some specific areas, the Department&rsquo;s rural development and regional affairs division seeks to promote and facilitate long-term sustainable economic and social progress across rural Ireland.  A sum of &euro;80.3 million of my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2017 relates directly to rural development.  Key actions include the implementation of the Leader programme at a cost of &euro;30 million, elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, and the delivery of a range of rural development schemes, including CL&Aacute;R, for which &euro;15 million has been allocated, a town and village enhancement scheme, for which &euro;12 million has been allocated, and the local improvement scheme, LIS, for which &euro;10 million has been allocated.<\/p><p>The Leader programme is administered by local action groups, LAGs.  These are partnerships of both public and private entities from a defined geographical area.  They are responsible for selecting and approving projects in their respective areas in accordance with local development strategies developed specifically for their area.  <font color=\"#212100\">The Leader programme initiative was set up by the European Commission in 1991 to drive rural development in local communities.  It uses a bottom-up or community-led local development approach to rural development.<\/font>The current programme is focused on three themes: economic development, enterprise development and job creation, social inclusion; and rural environment.  A number of schemes operate under the national rural development programme which has an allocation of &euro;15 million in 2017.  The outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and will provide funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure or the necessary maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in Ireland.  The CL&Aacute;R programme is a targeted investment programme which provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered the greatest levels of population decline.  The aim of CL&Aacute;R is to attract people to live and work in these communities.<\/p><p>The aim of the town and village renewal scheme is to support the revitalisation of towns and villages in order to improve the living and working environment of their communities and increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.  The 2017 town and village renewal scheme, launched in April this year, focuses on projects which can help to enhance and develop rural towns and villages with a particular emphasis on stimulating economic development.  <\/p><p> I am delighted to have reintroduced the local improvement scheme in 2017.  This scheme supports local authorities in the maintenance and improvement of non-public roads and lanes.  An allocation of &euro;10 million is being made available in 2017.  Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will deal with broadband.  The Department's 2017 Vote also provides &euro;80.3 million in funding for a range of community programmes.  The bulk of the funding, over &euro;42 million, is provided for social inclusion and community activation programmes, SICAP.  The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  I am confident that allocation of over &euro;42 million for 2017 will allow the continuation of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key essential front-line services delivered through the programme to be maintained.  SICAP works with individuals coming from targeted groups such as those experiencing disadvantage, lone parents, low income workers and households, refugees and asylum seekers,  people with disabilities, Travellers, Roma people and the unemployed.  The programme also works with local community groups to support them to address issues that affect them.  <\/p><p> The Government framework policy for local and community development supports the development of Government structures as part of the local government reform process.  Both local community development committees, LCDCs, and public participation networks, PPNs, are providing funding supports as part of the community programme.  The development of these processes and structures are strategically very important to the new Department as we work to ensure local voices influence planning and investment decisions at local level.  As an example, the SICAP programme is managed and implemented through the local community development committees as a new governance model for local and community programmes in each local authority area.  LCDCs give the local flexibility to make sure that SICAP is implemented in ways which address the key issues in the area.  Deputy Kyne will deal with the other part of the national organisations. <\/p><p> A recast RAPID, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, programme is also funded under the community programme.  The programme for partnership Government included a commitment to reactivate the programme in 2017.  RAPID provides support to groups which are tackling social inclusion and helping to improve the quality of life for residents in disadvantaged urban areas and provincial towns across the country.  The 2017 RAPID funding allocation has a special focus on improving the quality of life in Dublin's north-east inner city, an area which has rightly been prioritised for investment by the Government.  The new programme has been allocated a budget of &euro;4.5 million this year.  There is also an allocation of &euro;500,000 for legacy commitments under the old programme.  The community facilities scheme, CFS, is targeted at disadvantaged urban and rural areas and aims to fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at the local level.  The scheme is rolled out by the LCDCs.  Examples of eligible areas for funding are the development and renovation of community centres, community amenities, youth clubs, sports and recreation facilities or improvements of town parks and common areas and spaces.  The community facilities scheme funds the library development programme of &euro;3.8 million as well as the implementation of the Peace IV programme that funds actions that promote social and economic stability in Northern Ireland and the Border region.  <\/p><p> This is an exciting opportunity and I know that the members share with me the concern that regardless of where they live everybody living in rural areas and areas of disadvantage would have the same chances and choices.  The Government is committed to ensuring that its policies recognise the unique challenges these communities face.  Similarly, future investment choices must take account of these challenges.  We must ensure that they are discrete and targeted measures within my Vote and others which mitigate the risk that these challenges pose.  I know that the members will work with me in ensuring ongoing attention to these challenges and how we might meet them.  I look forward to our engagement and I have kept my remarks as brief as possible to allow a full discussion on the programmes and funding of my Department this year.  I would be happy to deal with any questions.  If the committee allows, Deputy Kyne might just say a few words on two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#C00400","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1521,"content":"<p>Yes, we will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#D00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members.  I wish the committee well in its role over the coming months and years.  My responsibilities include in the area of rural development, responsibility for the oversight of the work of the Western Development Commission and of the Atlantic economic corridor task force, functions relating to the Department's input on rural broadband and the national planning framework, overview of a number of the funding schemes under the community programme, responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority, excluding appointments of members of the board of the authority, and the responsibility for the Control of Dogs Act.<\/p> <p>  I am also responsible for identifying and advising on issues affecting rural communities with the business community arising from Britain's exit from the European Union.  In relation to broadband, to complement the work of my colleague, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, preparing for the timely roll-out of broadband is a key priority will see a very significant level of new investment under the national broadband plan, NBP.  The NBP&rsquo;s ambition is to achieve 100% coverage of high speed broadband across Ireland.  This is being done through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, together with a State intervention to deliver access to high speed broadband to those parts of the country where there is no certainty that the commercial sector will invest.  My Department is working with local authorities to ensure there are no local barriers to deployment and identifying priority areas for roll out.  A provision of &euro;2 million has been allocated to my Department for this task in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Department also has lead responsibility for developing the relationship with the State and community and voluntary sector and for setting the policy framework. This sector has &euro;12.7 million budgeted in 2017.  The Department&rsquo;s community and voluntary supports and programmes provide a cohesive framework of support for the community and voluntary sector.  This supports volunteer centres and volunteer information services nationwide, as well as a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and Young Social Innovators.  The funding of all these organisations is designed to strengthen and foster volunteerism in Ireland, building a support structure for volunteering locally from the bottom up.  This is key to the Department&rsquo;s citizen engagement objectives and supports the spirit of participation in communities.<\/p> <p>The scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, SSNO, is a key element of the State&rsquo;s support for the role of the sector.  The SSNO provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates provide for &euro;4.4 million in current funding in 2017 for the charities regulatory authority, CRA.  The charities regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations. It is an independent authority which was established on 16 October 2014 under the Charities Act 2009 and now comes under the remit of my Department.   The general function of the regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland, in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration.  The regulator is independent in the performance of its statutory functions.  Since its establishment in 2014, great progress has been achieved by the CRA.  By the end of September this year, 8,748 charities were registered.  Other important milestones achieved include the completion of an independent organisational review to define the resources required to implement the Charities Act, 2009, and the publication of a strategic plan for 2016-2018.  I am delighted to be working with the Minister, Deputy Ring, in this new Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#D00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1523,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#D00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Aire tar &eacute;is d&oacute; bheith ceaptha mar Aire Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  We all have the good of rural Ireland at heart.  As time will be limited, I am going to focus on five general themes and then presumably we will get a chance to go through it subhead by subhead.  There are an awful lot of questions here and our job as a committee is to question and to raise the issues that we think are neglected.  I do not envy the Minister his task.  However, I think overselling his powers could be a dangerous thing.  He says that he has a cross-Government mandate.  If he truly has, that is hugely important and there is an immediate urgent task on hand.  No doubt he has seen the draft national planning framework.  It is totally biased against rural communities.  Is the Minister willing to engage with this committee to work with us to ensure that planning framework when it is finalised gives fair play to rural communities up and down the country?<\/p><p>Is the Minister willing to engage, hear what we have to say and discuss the submissions we have made regarding that framework?  That will be an acid test of what cross-Government mandate he really has.<br\/><br\/>I have made this third point before and I sincerely believe it.  The Department of Rural and Community Development does not have enough functions.  A report will be published soon from the previous Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and it will propose giving a lot more functions to the Department.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be cheering us on, as will his officials, because Departments love to be given functions.  However, it seems absolutely ridiculous to have a Minister for Rural and Community Development with a spend of &euro;80 million, out of a total State spend of about &euro;60 billion.  The kind of functions that would obviously lie with the Department would be the rural social scheme, farm assist, the community services programme, the community employment scheme, the rural transport programme, etc.  We need to return to this topic another day, because the Department just does not have the functions it will need if it is to deliver on its mandate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Kyne, spoke fairly quickly, and I could not write everything he said down in time.  Could the Minister circulate to each member of the committee a list of the functions that he is retaining, referenced by sub-head.  I believe in always following the money.  What sub-heads does he have, and what sub-heads does his Minister of State have?  Can he confirm that delegated sanction has been given to the Minister of State?  <br\/><br\/>As a fourth point, I believe a historic opportunity has been missed in the setting up of this Department.  There are now 17 Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, even though there are only 15 Cabinet Ministers.  There was the fantastic situation of setting up a brand new Department, but the Government sent a very bad signal about its attitude towards rural Ireland by headquartering the Department of Rural and Community Development in Dublin.  There was no need or reason for this.  The normal personnel issues of people being <i>in situ <\/i>were not a challenge.  The Government could have gone to the broad Civil Service and recruited someone who wanted to be a Secretary General in a rural area, people who wanted to work in the accounts division and so on.  Experience has shown us that when people take Civil Service jobs in rural locations the problem arises in getting them to come back to Dublin, not in getting them out.  There are more than enough people at the top level willing to work in rural Ireland.With modern technology there is no difficulty in working from remote locations now.  The only regular travel involved might be the Secretary General coming to Dublin one day per week.<br\/><br\/>Then there is the issue of finance.  The Minister will know that I have been pursuing this for a long time.  The spend on the community side, most of which was previously in the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is not too bad.  That is, 89% of the current spend has been used and one would expect that at this time of the year.  Some 60% of the cap has been spent - that is small, but not disastrous.  However, let us focus on the rural side.  On 10 November 2017, ten months and one week into the year, the Minister has only spent 42% of the current expenditure.  Normally, one would expect that at this time of the year the figure would be higher than 80% of current expenditure.  Can the Minister provide a global explanation of how this has occurred?  I am not asking for a line-by-line explanation, as we will come back to those issues.  When I look at the capital spend, the situation gets even more serious.  The Department has &euro;67,389,000 in capital in its budget, and as of 10 November, only &euro;13.999 million, 20% of the total, has been spent.  That means that to have a full spend, the Minister will now have to spend 80% of the capital in the month and a half between now and the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, at the end of 2016, the Department prepaid local authorities &euro;28 million for work that they had not done, work only sanctioned in December 2016.  This is something I have never seen before.  According to the last information I was given, which I got a few weeks ago, some &euro;11 million of that had still not been spent.  Any question of pre-paying local authorities at the end of this year will add insult to injury where under-spend is concerned.  Furthermore in that regard, I notice that there is an intention to pay local authorities for work done on the local improvement schemes, LIS , up to 17 November on their own say-so, without any inspection.  I must seriously question this.  Not only will the Department pay them for that work, it will pay them for all of the LIS roads, hoping on a wing and a prayer that they will do them by the end of the year.  I have had a lot of experience dealing with local authorities over the years.  I was on a local authority, and then I had a lot of experience dealing with them in previous roles I had in the Oireacthas.  To be quite honest, I would not give them the money until it was spent and I had a chance to inspect that the work was done to standard.  It is a normal procedure.  Let us be honest about it; if the Government was giving a housing grant of &euro;4,000 to somebody, they would not give it unless they were satisfied that the work was done to the standard that was outlined.  There seems to be a crisis of non-spend in the part of the Department that the Minister actually brought over with him from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  He owes it to us to tell us whether he is going to hand massive amounts of money back to the Exchequer and carry forward10%, or is he again going to pre-pay local authorities for work not done?  It is an utter crisis at this stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#D00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be on this committee, and I am delighted to see Mayo and Galway joining forces within the Department.  I look forward to working with both the Minister, Deputy Ring and Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to provide for rural and community development over the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions at this stage.  In the programme for Government it was agreed that the Western Development Commission will have an enhanced role under this Government.  What type of enhanced role will it have?  What additional functions is it going to be given to make it more active and more effective within rural Ireland?<\/p> <p>   I also note from recent announcements that the western regional audio-visual producers fund has been set up.  I would like to know how that is going to be funded and how much funding it will receive.  <\/p> <p>  Listening to the Minister, Deputy  Ring, I welcome all of the funding that has been allocated to the Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rd-Riachtanais programme, CL&Aacute;R, to town and village renewal, to the LIS and to recreational schemes, which are a valuable source of development for rural Ireland.  Deputy &Oacute; Cuiv raised the issue of local authorities.  I wonder if the Minister would consider bringing other organisations on board to deliver some of these programmes.  Given the structures that they have, the local authorities may not have the resources to deliver these projects in a timely fashion at this stage.  There has been a huge amount of cutbacks to the local authorities.  They may not have the resources of the management teams to deliver.  Would the Minister consider other organisations, such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Western Development Commission or the companies funded by the LEADER rural development programme as vehicles by which this funding could be rapidly delivered into the communities?<\/p><p> My last point relates to the national planning framework, but it also concerns the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, which was in the programme for Government, and where that sits within the Department.  I suggest that we should bring the people who are involved in the AEC before this committee at some stage to give us a presentation on it.  It is the only vehicle by which we will once and for all create balanced development in this country and create that counterbalance required to alleviate the pressure on the east coast \u00ecn order that people can work and live in their own parishes into the future, for their children and grandchildren.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#E00200","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1528,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will take some of the questions that cover his area.<\/p> <p>  The first question that Deputy O'Keeffe raised is the most important question of the day because it is the most important issue in planning for the future of rural Ireland.  At the moment my officials are working with senior officials within the Cabinet sub-committee on the national framework plan.  I was asked if I would come before this committee.  I have no difficulty coming here because I have already made major submissions to the plan myself.  I am sure that the Deputy and his party have made submissions as well.  Other organisations have also made submissions.  The Deputy is quite correct that this is going to be a very important plan for all of rural Ireland, and my job at Government level is to make sure that this plan is framed in the correct way and will support the regions, small towns and big towns.  We also have to ensure that when the plan is announced, the funding will be going with it.  We need the funding and the infrastructure, and we need to monitor that plan in a very careful way.  I certainly will be doing that, and I have no problem coming in here to discuss that with the committee at any time.  The committee has a big role in this plan.  I also hope that my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, comes before the committee as soon as possible as well.  This committee should make its views known in terms of what it wants in this plan.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is saying what I have been saying about functions.  We both want there to be more functions.  Every Department that has anything to do with rural Ireland should have some functions allocated to it.  We have already had some elements transferred from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, including the community services programme.  That will come under my Department from 1 January.  I have also mentioned this to other Ministers and the Taoiseach . There are schemes in other Departments that should be coming over to my Department.  I compliment the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, because she had no qualms about it and was quite prepared to pass the community services programme to my Department.  I am sure that we can have further discussions about the other schemes she has in her Department.  The Deputy is talking my language.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Kyne, has a delegated function.  I hope that the members of this committee understand what that means.  We have no problem giving the committee any information it requires.  The Minister of State himself will speak about it.  He is responsible for the Western Development Commission, the Atlantic economic corridor task force, the roll-out of broadband, the national planning framework, dormant accounts, supporting the national organisations community and voluntary funding schemes, the public participation of citizens engagement policy forum, the charity regulatory authority, the Control of Dogs Act and issues affecting rural communities, including business community streaming for Brexit.  He will take any of the issues that have been raised.  It has gone through the Cabinet and the committee should have that list because I asked for it to be sent over this morning.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the day is funding. At the moment we are monitoring this hour to hour and day to day.  I am meeting my officials about the issue this afternoon.  We have been in constant contact with the local authorities about prefunding.  We have not made any decision on that.  I am hoping that the local authorities will certainly spend the money they have been given, and I know that there has been a major effort over recent weeks on that issue.  We will be monitoring this day to day, and we hope that the local authorities will draw down the funding that has been allocated to them.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the underspend in the LEADER programme was also raised.  It is causing people great difficulty.  I took &euro;10 million from that programme this year and put it into the local improvement scheme, LIS.  If I had put &euro;20 million and another &euro;10 million next year, the Deputy would be saying that we were cutting funding to the scheme, so I did not do that.  I am glad that we did spend that &euro;10 million on the LIS and I am glad that we introduced that scheme.  The LEADER programme is one that we are monitoring.  There has been a major improvement since July, with 31 changes made, and I hope that we will see more approvals and more drawdown.  It is causing a bit of difficulty at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Canning asked about the local authorities.  To be fair to the local authorities, we were late in allocating some of the schemes this year.  This is a new Department, and the Deputy, having set up a Department himself, knows that it is very difficult and that it takes a bit of time, work and effort.  We have made a lot of progress in a very short time.  We are expected to be a fully functioning Department and we are only at the set-up stage.  We have progressed rapidly in a very short time, and I am hopeful that there will be a big improvement in the spend by the local authorities and LEADER between now and the end of the month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#F00200","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1529,"content":"<p>The problem also applied to the Minister's time at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

Funding must transfer to these schemes from savings elsewhere in the rural development programme from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Vote last year.  The schemes are being delivered through the local authorities, which were required to pay a percentage of the overall cost of projects under this scheme.  However, when the newly announced schemes were launched in the second half of the year, the local authorities did not factor that expenditure into their budgets for that year.  The local authorities had difficulties with their own budgets, but also in financing these schemes.  In those circumstances, we obtained permission from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make advance payments for last December.  We have not made any decision for this year yet.  For the town and village scheme to get any payment, 20% had to be spent for the local authorities to get 50%, and to get the remainder the full allocation had to be spent.<\/p> <p>  I want to move away from prefunding this year and move from advance funding to the better scheduling of programmes.

He asked if I am looking at other ways and means of delivering those programmes.  Yes, I am looking at ways and means because the local authorities are complaining to me that they do not have the resources or staff and that they are not able to complete some of the programmes.  If that is the case I must begin to look at other ways and means of delivering the programmes, which are vital.  People have sought the programmes and they are creating jobs.<\/p><p> There is a very simple scheme in Drumshanbo.  We gave &euro;700,000 to Waterways Ireland at the same time as we gave funding to the local authority.  We were able to open the project in October.

Deputy Canney knows it is not in my interest for the money not to be spent because he was a Minister of State in the Department.  I want the money to be spent and for communities to benefit from it.  If local authorities feel they are not in a position to deal with the schemes then I must look at other ways and means.

The WDC is an active part of the subgroup of this task force which is mapping out the options for EU funding which could support the development of the western region and has also assisted the Department in participating in and reporting on a public dialogue on the implications of Brexit in the thematic areas of rural communities, regional SMEs, culture, the Irish language and heritage and outdoor recreation.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the WDC is an important part of the wider focus on regional development by the Government which also includes a deeper role in economic development by the local authorities and the regional assemblies.  The WDC&rsquo;s involvement in an increasing number of initiatives such as those outlined above go beyond the role the body has played to date but I am open to a further role for the WDC.  I met with the CEO, Ian Brannigan, and the chair of the board, Deirdre Garvey, a couple of weeks ago in Ballaghadereen.  They have played a strong role and I know that they can play a further role and I am open to suggestions and ideas for a further enhanced role for the WDC.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the WRAP, Western Regional Audiovisual Producers, fund which was very well received.  I had the pleasure of launching that in October last in Galway.  The fund was set up through the WDC in conjunction with the Irish Film Centre as well.  The fund is worth &euro;2 million and operates in conjunction with local authorities in Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.  It is funded through the WDC investment fund, which was specified in the Act.  The WDC has been able to provide &euro;2 million in funding to help develop the sector.  It is part of the Action Plan for Jobs under Action 144 of the Government&rsquo;s action plan to develop and implement an action plan to support the film industry in Galway and the western region and support the potential for a regional film fund.  That is being led by the WDC, the Irish Film Centre and the local authorities.  The fund has been very well received by all local authorities in the area and by the sectors.  It is hugely important and has great potential.  We know the film sector in Galway has a great history and great work is being done at present there and the fund will add to its potential.<\/p> <p>  The Atlantic economic corridor is being developed through the chambers of commerce in the west.  The IDA had a predecessor concept which was known as the western arc.  The concept was promoted in the discussions for the programme for Government in which Deputy Canney and Deputy Fitzmaurice were involved and it was taken on board by the Government.  The initiative has been led by the chambers of commerce and includes the City and County Management Association, CCMA, the western regional authorities and the southern regional assembly.  It was proposed in February 2016.  The overarching objective is to maximise the assets of the western region from Kerry to Donegal and to connect the economic hubs, clusters and catchment areas in the region to attract investment, support job creation and contribute to enhanced quality of life for those who live in that region.<\/p> <p>  I chaired the previous task force and I attended the one previous to that and there were probably one or two meetings prior to that as well which were attended by the Minister, Deputy Ring.  It is at an early stage but much work has been done already and there are subcommittees in place for infrastructure and communications and work is being done on websites and promotional videos.  Much work is being done with various bodies including universities and institutes of technology.  The meeting in Galway took place in NUIG and the meeting prior to that took place in Sligo in the Building Block which is the innovation hub in the centre of the town.  I believe the concept has great potential and it is fully supported.  We have included it and its role in the national planning framework in the submission we made through this Department and I hope that will be taken on board by the Minister.  Any support the committee can give in that regard would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#G00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1533,"content":"<p>I wish to respond also to Deputy Canney's question about the Atlantic economic corridor.

I wish to look at two issues.  The Leader programme is a very efficient source of funding but there have been serious problems.  I accept the Minister's point that 31 changes will be made to the programme but there are 18 bureaucratic steps to be taken by local community groups in order to access funding.  That is proving to be a nightmare.  It is my understanding that only 335 projects have been approved to date compared to more than 2,800 during the first two years of the previous programme.  Would it not make more sense to bring back the old programme?  I do not understand why it changed.  It does not make sense to try to fix something if it is not broken.  It would make more sense to bring back the old Leader model as it proved more efficient in terms of communities being able to drawn down funding.  I am aware from representations in my constituency office that communities are experiencing serious difficulty and I want to bring that message to the Minister and call on him to examine the possibility of bringing back the old model.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the reinstatement of the local improvement scheme but should there not be a separate allocation for the scheme rather than taking it from the Leader budget, which I understand has been the case.  Such a scheme should have a standalone allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#G00500","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1536,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Niamh Smyth.

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on his promotion to the Ministry.  It is one of the most important Departments when one considers the size of the island and how much of it is rural.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comment that he is open to discussion with the committee on the national planning framework.  Rural areas need much work and investment, including basic infrastructure.<\/p><p>We have no rail, airports, or anything of that nature in Cavan and Monaghan so we are totally dependent on a very good road network.  As I have pointed out in the D&aacute;il Chamber, if one were to look at a map of Ireland one would see a motorway that cuts from Dublin to Galway with all other motorways to major cities south of that.  North of that line - Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan - these motorways are non-existent.  When it comes to developing a major road network, we have been completely forgotten.  There was a plan many years ago for an east-west link that would open up the whole north-east corridor from Dundalk to Sligo, taking in the whole Border region.  I urge the Minister and his Department to look at this matter very seriously and consider what influence he might have on the national planning framework, which will be critical in light of Brexit.<\/p><p> The Minister spoke to us of the many funding streams for which he is responsible:  LEADER; CL&Aacute;R; local improvement schemes,LIS; and Revitialising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development, RAPID.  These are hugely important at national as well as constituency level and rural areas like Cavan-Monaghan are extremely dependent on them.  Under the town and village renewal scheme, for example, Cavan was allocated a handsome &euro;380,000.  Up until October of this year, as I understand it, only &euro;57,000 had been spent.  I am very concerned by this because I have only to step outside my door to see areas that could massively benefit from this money.  In Bailieborough, for example, we have a major social housing scheme called Drumbannon which was the first of a number of such schemes in the town.  Drumbannon backs onto the next housing estate, Woodview, and there are a number of alleyways running between them which are crucial for providing simple pedestrian access from one estate to the other.  For years the residents have been complaining about the lack of pedestrian access, and rightly so, but according to my information the council has been unable to source any funding to address this.  When I then hear that the council had been allocated &euro;380,000 under the town and village renewal scheme and that only &euro;57,000 of that figure has actually been spent, I am concerned at the reasons for such a delay and at what it might be that is restricting our councils from getting that money to where it is so badly needed.  <\/p><p> In 2016, meanwhile, almost half a million euro was allocated to Cavan County Council under the CL&Aacute;R funding scheme, but again only slightly more that &euro;100,000 of that was actually spent on projects, a major underspend in relation to the total allocation.  I ask the question again:  what is restricting our councils here?  My information on this suggests that public consultations do not perhaps have the staff resources in place to get that money out.  The notion of giving this money to local authorities and then leaving them in the position where they are unable to spend it concerns and worries me greatly, especially when there are areas that badly need that money.  I urge the Minister to engage with the local authorities to see how they might be enabled to get that money out.  <\/p><p> I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought back the local improvement scheme, which had been discontinued in 2008, and is badly needed.  The roads departments in our local authorities have been building up application after application over the past ten years, and by this stage they are gathering dust.  It is hugely important that the Minister has brought the LIS back into play for our local authorities, though I agree with Deputy Nolan that it is unfortunate that one has to rob Peter to pay Paul in this regard.  Traditionally there was a specific allocation for the LIS and this should be reintroduced so that no other Department or scheme will suffer.  I welcome the Minister's courage in bringing back this scheme but we need much more because many rural residents depend on it.  <\/p><p> I wish to mention the Ulster Canal restoration project, which is another initiative that could open up much of the east-west corridor.  The area is very dependent on projects like this one, which has so much capacity to build up our tourism and local economy.  Rural areas have so much to benefit from this.  I urge the Minister to engage with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, as I am sure he has been doing, to ensure that this project progress in a timely fashion because it is crucial for the area.  <\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Nolan when it comes to the 18 checks and balances contained in the LEADER funding scheme.  LEADER is one of the more successful schemes for rural communities but are 18 checks and balances really necessary?  Could these not be scaled back to get the money out there and facilitate community groups in delivering on projects?  These checks and balances are certainly not encouraging.  Many of the bodies engaging with LEADER are voluntary groups with no paid staff.  Our rural communities will suffocate and die without access to that money and the 18 checks and balances are certainly not providing any encouragement.  The number of projects in Cavan-Monaghan that had successfully accessed LEADER funding stood in single figures the last time I checked.  <\/p><p> I would appreciate it if the Minister could address some of the issues that I have raised here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#G00700","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1539,"content":"<p>We had a LEADER forum involving all of the relevant groups on 17 May of this year in order to explore the issues and concerns around the lags and delays, and to identify potential solutions and ways of streamlining the current LEADER programme.  The forum identified a number of areas where it felt procedures could be streamlined and where the burden of project applications could be reduced.  On the basis of feedback received from that forum, the Department of Rural and Community Development has committed to 31 actions, or 31 changes to be made across most of the problems flagged.  My understanding is that two-thirds of these actions have now been implemented, which has certainly led to a degree of streamlining, and since July we have seen major improvements in the LEADER scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in saying that the LEADER programme has been slow in getting up and running.  Looking back at last programme from 2007-2013, however, we see that it had an allocation of &euro;400 million as compared to &euro;250 million now for the 2014-2020 programme.  The 2007-2013 programme did not get up and running until the funding agreements were signed in the first half of 2009.  Most of the funding agreements for the 2014-2020 programme, meanwhile, were signed in the second half of 2016, amounting to a six-month difference to the signing of its predecessor.  There are also differences in structures and systems.  In August 2010, a year and a half after the funding was signed, the 2007-2013 programme had spent less than 10% of its &euro;38 million allocation.  A total of 52% of that 2007-2013 programme, meanwhile, was spent on administration, while the full allocation has still yet to be drawn down.  As of September 2017 a total of &euro;375 million had been paid out on the old programme, that is to say &euro;25 million of the full allocation has yet to be drawn down.  We are now beginning to see a significant increase under the new programme with &euro;11 million worth of projects already up and running.  There have certainly been difficulties but we have now made changes.  Having met the LEADER companies at the forum, I met them again last week and they are now telling me that the new changes have simplified the whole process.  There have to be checks and balances, however, because the EU wants 100% of the projects to be checked because of issues with previous programmes.  I have to operate within these rules and regulations but I have, nonetheless, simplified the process and hope to see major improvements with LEADER.<\/p> <p>  With regard to local improvement schemes, no such scheme had been in place for a very long time.  I tried to get the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide a scheme, or even join me on this particular scheme, but it did not.  I found &euro;10 million for the local improvement scheme this year.<\/p><p>Deputy Smyth is quite correct, I have put it into a programme for this year, so there is a programme in place for the LIS.<\/p><p> I have learned from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I will try to get that &euro;10 million out as quickly as I can early in the new year, and if there are savings, there could be a further scheme later on in the year.  At least there is &euro;10 million in the programme for next year.  There is a programme now and there will be one for the future.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about a plan.  He is correct that a plan is very important.  There are many areas in this country that do not have motorways, rail or the infrastructure that they need.  Areas, particularly rural areas, been deprived.  Last week there was an announcement about Pobal.  That is why the plan is important and I do not mind coming back to this committee about it.  I hope that the committee will bring the Minister, Deputy Murphy, before it and make its views known.  I have made my views known.  I have put in major submissions to the plan and I will monitor it every step of the way to ensure that we see a rebalancing relative to Dublin.  Dublin is the capital city and is doing well, which is great to see, but we need to rebalance.  We must get infrastructure and jobs into rural areas and get people back living and working there.  With the plan and the capital programme we had to be careful that the rural areas were in the plan and that the money followed it.  If it had not been in the plan, the money would not have been there.  It is a challenge for us all and I will be there.<\/p><p> On funding in Deputy Smyth's own county of Cavan, I could be critical of local authorities.  I will not criticise them today but I have seen this happening.  Why do local authorities make applications for schemes which they do not have ready?  If they are applying for schemes, if they do not have the funding in place and they are not shovel ready, why are they making the applications?  In the Deputy's county, it got &euro;200,000 for the rents programme in 2016, of which &euro;72,500 was spent, a 36% spend.  The Deputy was correct on the town and village programme.  It got &euro;380,000.  It did fairly well on that.  It spent &euro;260,229, which is a 68% spend of the funds.  From the CL&Aacute;R programme, it got &euro;498,000.  It did very well on that, and has spent &euro;459,000 of that.  It received &euro;45,000 for the rural recreation scheme and has spent &euro;30,000.  Those are all the schemes for which County Cavan was awarded funds, coming to &euro;1.123 million of which it has spent &euro;822,000.  There has been an improvement, a 73% spend of the funding it has received.  Those figures are up to date and I will make those available to Deputy Smyth if she wants them.  I would like to see the local authorities spending 100% of their funding.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the LIS.  This will be the challenge for the local authorities.  We wrote to them and asked them to submit plans for roads on which they could spend the money.  I do not want to see them looking for time to extend it at the end of the month.  All the rural Deputies here will know that when I was on the council, and I expect this was the same for others, the LIS was always left until November or December.  The councils have had time to do it.  They always look to do work at the end of the year.  They have the &euro;10 million in the new year and I want to see every penny of it spent.  If that does not happen and if they will not spend the money, what is the point of having the LIS?  At some stage next year, there may be an opportunity to put additional funding into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#H00200","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>I asked a question about that spend on 7 November and was given a reply with out-of-date figures.

They say that the changes did not come from them.  Some of the changes were unnecessary.  The process could have been kept simpler and we would not need to have met all the groups and go through everything as we have done.

We made the changes and I believe, and the Deputy might check this with her own Leader company, that it has been better streamlined and there has been an improvement.  Approximately 429 Leader projects have received around &euro;11 million in Leader funding to date.  That is the up-to-date figure, and there has been an improvement.  There are requests for 400 further projects amounting to funding of up to &euro;14 million.

I spoke to them last week after they requested a meeting, and I told them I wanted to work with them, not against them.  It is not in my interest for the funds to be returned.

Every one of them will receive a copy of that when they come in the door and I will ask them what they can do in respect of spending the money.<\/p> <p>  We have also commenced a programme of capacity building training for members of the Local Community Development Committee, LCDC, to help them deal with their Votes in administering Leader, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and other schemes.  We are trying to assist them in spending the money.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#K00300","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1558,"content":"<p>I am being very lenient because we nearly have the programme scoured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#K00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1559,"content":"<p>First I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments.  I fought a long time for a standalone Minister for rural and community affairs and we have that now.  It is a very important position because rural issues had been slightly left behind down the years.  I hope we will be able to address many issues in the future and work closely together.<\/p> <p>  I will start on a positive note, the local improvements scheme.  It is a great scheme.  I see some of the examples of that in west Cork, where people need to get their local roads sorted.  One has just been finished in Ballineen.  I regret that the &euro;10 million for that came out of the Leader budget but it had to come out of some budget.  It is delivering and working now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about Cork County Council spending only 21%, which stuns me.  I would have expected that a local authority when it gets the money would try to get it out as quickly as possible.  The Minister, however, must remember that his Government gave them the Leader programme when it should have examined the figures prior to that.  Instead, it broke up the excellent system that was there.  It probably needed a bit of tweaking to get sorted out but the Government tampered with it and made a complete mess of it.  If someone mentioned Leader, development partnership or funding three or four years ago in west Cork everybody would tell them where and how they could get it if they rang a certain number.  If it is mentioned now the person would be told to forget about it because it is gone.  That is the rumour going around.  The local authority was not able to take control of that programme, which had been run very efficiently by the development partnerships.  Unfortunately, the Government pulled the plug which has been detrimental to rural communities.  I do not need to tell any Deputy here where Leader funding has gone through the years.  It looks as if we are coming close to the end of the programme we have at the moment and we have a little over two years left.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister said that the money was not being spent in the last programme but at least they had four years.  We are heading for two years left in this programme and there is little or no money spent.  Some of the staff from some of the companies have not been paid their redundancy payments which is scandalous and very unfair after they had served people for many years.  In my area in west Cork their stamp was remarkable and now it is embarrassing to mention Leader.  I would not even mention it at any public meeting when people ask me where they will get funding because it does not happen and it is only frustrating people.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister was in west Cork recently.  I am sorry I did not have the opportunity to welcome him but I was not even told he was coming.  I assume in my role as a politician that Ministers are Ministers for the people and not for one individual Deputy in one area.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who is a member of the Independent Alliance was in west Cork as were the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, and when I knew they were coming I let my fellow Deputies know, to be fair to everybody.  That did not happen when the Minister for Rural and Community Development came down.  Notice did not come from the Department or from the local Deputy.  Many of the projects the Minister visited in Drinagh were absolutely delighted to get funding but we were involved in that too.  It is important for Ministers to know that when they are in a community they should at least let public representatives know and not politicise the visit.  <\/p> <p>  I sincerely hope that the Minister can get hold of the community employment, CE, schemes.  To be fair to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, she is a good Minister.  One can talk to her and she tries her best to resolve issues but there is a little misunderstanding about CE workers in rural communities.  I know people aged 59 or 60 who are delighted to work in their local communities but they are going home now because their time is up and they will never get a job again.  They will literally be looking out the window and drawing social welfare instead of being out working for the &euro;20 or &euro;30 extra a week they were getting.  They were happy to do that work.  The community groups are fighting to keep them and they are fighting to stay because they like the work.  They are a loss to the community and are very hard to replace.  We are given all the carry-on about unemployment dropping but 60,000 are going onto new schemes and 40,000 are going back on social welfare after going through that system.  I hope we can address that.  The rural social scheme is another big issue.  I hope there will be an extra allocation of workers.  They will be better distributed because, unlike the local authority, the West Cork Development Partnership is allocating rural social workers in west Cork in a very fair manner.  Our numbers per head of population were very low and I hope we will be looked on more favourably in the new allocation of workers. <\/p> <p>  I would expect that rural proofing comes under the Minister's brief because it is not working at the moment.  There are many announcements about it.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris mentioned it last week.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was not present when I was speaking on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 last night.  Where is the rural proofing?  The Ministers say they are meeting with the groups and telling them what they are doing.  They announce changes happening.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said last night when speaking on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 that he met with all the groups but no transport has been put in place to deal with people living in rural isolation which prevents them going for a social drink and causes worry.  The same is true of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2017 because shopkeepers are worried about what it will do to their supermarkets.  The Minister for Health is ploughing ahead.  It is lovely to say we are rural proofing but the Minister needs to sit down and see how he can resolve an issue before he puts a Bill before the people.  <\/p> <p>  With no disrespect to the Minister, the local authority broadband is not going to work at all.  It is not working in west Cork.  We have seen very little expansion of rural broadband and I am worn out talking to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on this issue.  It is a big issue.  The first thing people will tell any politician knocking on doors, whenever that will be, this year, next year or the year after, is that they have no broadband and that to get mobile phone coverage they have to go upstairs and hang their heads out the window.  These issues are not progressing.  If Leader was working they could be rolled out through a Leader programme and communities would roll it out for themselves.<\/p><p>I can assure the Minister that if we were to stand back, it would be done then.  We did it in Goleen, a rural community near Mizen Head.  We rolled out broadband when people did not know what it meant.  I did not know what it meant myself to be quite honest.  We were able to get it and it was wireless broadband at the time, which was perhaps 15, 16 or 17 years ago, but it has not progressed since.  The Government is cherry-picking the big towns and the percentage looks good, but it will put the private operator out of business, which is a serious issue that no one seems to realise.   Take a town such as Bantry.  If the rural broadband scheme comes in and takes out the town of Bantry, the private operator, who is providing it to all the rural places the scheme will not touch, will be put out of business.  I can see us facing broadband crises before the national scheme, which is repeatedly postponed, is rolled out.  I will be looking for my pension before we see it happening.  We need to be very careful about the road we are travelling.  It is nice to be cherry-picking the bigger towns and taking them out of it but, all of a sudden then, the guy who is currently providing broadband will no longer be able to provide it.<\/p><p> I have worries about the Charities Act too.  I know and accept that there had to be a lot of cleaning up there.  The Minister mentioned it.  However, many elderly people in community groups who never caused a problem to anyone in the world are now getting letters from what looks like the Revenue Commissioners and they are extremely worried.  Many of them have disbanded.  These community groups would have continued away nicely.  They might not have been active for two or three years and then they would have come alive again and collected &euro;20,000 for someone who had a serious accident down the road.  Not every community group can have an accountant or that kind of expertise, but they worked efficiently.  However, they are being made to look very bad now under this Charities Act.  The suggestion is that they are being cleaned up now because there is something wrong, although there is not.  Many of these groups are being disbanded and I would like clarity about where their moneys are now.  Many of them said that they are not going to deal with the new requirements and for the &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000 in the account to be taken.  This money is going back into the system.  Is that money being distributed in the community from which it was taken?  I attended a recent presentation and it was not clear to me that the money was going back to the community from which it was taken.  It should go back to that community because it was genuinely collected there.  The group that has disbanded because it is not able to take on the new system has lost that money and the community has lost that money.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> I had better stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#K00500","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1561,"content":"<p>The latitude is unbelievable and it is only the first meeting.

I share a rural constituency with the Acting Chairman and we know the importance of having a Minister with responsibility for rural affairs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has also been of huge assistance to us in successfully securing Cullion fish farm in our constituency.<\/p> <p>  I see clearly that the Minister's job is to initiate policy.  There are 276 actions under five pillars in the rural development plan.  We hear the debate about the spend of money in local authorities.  To me, there are two key words: \"allocate\" and \"spend\".  It is the Minister's job to ensure he has the policies in place to allocate money to the local authorities in order that they can spend it.  We have to realise, however, that we have a system of local democracy.  We pay directors of services and staff in county councils large sums of money and they should be held accountable and spend the money they are given.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about underspends in local improvement schemes and said that we should be inspecting all these roads and works.  Is it the Minister's job to go around holding the hands of those in a local authority to ensure that the works are carried out on every byroad and back road?  I do not think so.<\/p> <p>  Rather than being negative, I will share our experience in Westmeath County Council.  I took it upon myself to meet the management team within the county.  It was not a huge secret that we have a new Department with responsibility for rural affairs, nor was it a secret that the Minister is setting up this new Department, which will take time, and that he has a big budget which he is trying to get together and ensure he gives to the local authorities.  Westmeath County Council restructured its management section and it now has a section that mirrors the Department of Rural and Community Development.  This is to ensure that it can spend its money when it gets it and that it puts forward professional applications.  We have heard that some of the applications of local authorities under the town and village enhancement schemes were quite poor, but that is a matter for the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  At budget meetings throughout Ireland, the director of services, the director of finance and the heads of local authorities are going in front of our local elected members, and those members need to be asking where the spends are in all these key areas to ensure that we get accountability.  That is the democratic system.  On the idea that the Minister would hold the hands of those in a local authority and call in all these county managers to ensure they have spent all their money and to ensure they know they need to take responsibility, they are being paid to do that job.  It is the Minister's job to allocate the money to them.  Therefore, rather than giving out at length, we should be going back to the local authorities and the members with whom we work in the local authorities and asking them to hold their management to account.  We should be asking our local authorities how they are responding to the new Department of Rural and Community Development and how they are ensuring they are in the best possible position to get funding.<\/p> <p>  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  On dormant accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2016 recommends a review of the 2013 to 2016 disbursement scheme to identify how well the scheme has been implemented and how future schemes can be designed to ensure objectives are met.  Has this review been carried out?  Will the Minister shed some light on the average net transfers from the dormant accounts and repayments to account holders who make claims?  We have an awful lot of schemes now.  We have seen how well schemes such as CL&Aacute;R and the sports capital grants scheme, which the Minister was in charge of, have delivered to local authorities, especially given we are getting more resources now.  It has been a very difficult time but it is important that we all share responsibility.  We have heard arguments where people try to bury rural Ireland and say it is dead and gone.  It is not.  We are trying to target key areas to improve rural areas of Ireland, and rural communities are responding.  When they get the money, we must ensure that we, on behalf of the citizens, advocate to ensure that it is spent and that we are not listening to this argument again in the future.<\/p> <p>  I will mention a critical matter.  The Minister asked for shovel-ready projects for some of those schemes.  That is what they should be given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#L00300","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1563,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burke for his brevity and call the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#L00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1564,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Collins first on the local improvement schemes.  He is quite correct.  While I know that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was down in the constituency, he did not deliver the local improvement scheme, however.  I did that.  He was there 17 or 18 months ago and he did not deliver it.  I delivered it though and we now have a scheme in place for the Deputy.  On my visit to west Cork, no matter where I go, I try to notify everybody.  It will not happen again because I will notify people.  I do not really mind.  I like people and, if I am in a place, it is great when Deputies and councillors give up their time to come.  I appreciate that because I know people are busy.  The day itself, when I was in that hub in Skibbereen, was tremendous.  It is a credit to those involved.  My town and village enhancement schemes money is in that digital hub.  It was brilliant to see the number of professional people using the facility, the broadband and the information technology that was available to them and to see some local people now moving out and setting up jobs.  I went down to Bandon, another town that I thought was thriving.  It was great to see the OPW works that were taking place.  The Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, provided funding to deal with the floods that occurred there many years ago.   It was great to see those works happening.  What can I say about Clonakilty?  I never met a group that was as excited as the Tidy Towns group there.  Those people love their town so much.  There are also other groups involved in other organisations in the town.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Collins raised the issue of rural-proofing again.  It is a good point.  I have a job at the Cabinet table to bring the rural voice.  As the Deputy himself stated, he sought a Minister with responsibility for rural and economic development.  I am there now.  I have to make every Minister accountable to rural Ireland and to ensure that whatever is happening at the Cabinet table is rural-proofed.  I am not alone there.  I have colleagues who need to support me and help me, and they will.  People realise that we have to rebalance what is happening in the country.  I will continue to work at the Cabinet table to ensure that is happening.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the role of local authorities in the community.<\/p><p>Deputy Burke put it very well.  My job is to allocate the money and it is the local authority's job to spend it.  I brought in the various schemes, including the rural recreation scheme, the local improvement scheme, the town and village scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The schemes are all making a major impact where I see them being delivered.  The local improvement scheme was the best received.  It was for those who needed a real boost to improve their boreens and roads.  They are paying their taxes and water charges and they are also making a contribution to the scheme itself.  I reduced the contribution.  <\/p><p> The other issue raised concerned communities being involved in making decisions.  Local government reform was about giving people a say in prioritising what was happening in their area.  The local community development committees are with the local authorities.  There is a mix of local authority members, businesspeople and representatives of all other sectors of society.  They have to prioritise where the money should be spent and identify the difficulties and issues that arise.  We have time to bring the initiative to the people.  I really hope that it works.  It is working.  I want to make sure that the communities have a say and are involved, and that their powers are used wisely.  I hope what is done occurs not because of a councillor is from a particular area but because there is a need to address a certain problem.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the Leader programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will deal with broadband.<\/p><p> Deputy Burke referred to our action plan.  My officials will be delighted to attend a committee meeting in this regard.  The Chairman should arrange for it.  I will hand the question on charities and dormant accounts over to Deputy Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#L00500","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1566,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for his questions.  With regard to the charities, we all know the importance of the charities sector.  I refer not only to the large health-based and education-based charities.  There are charities in every town and village and they do valuable work.  Unfortunately, there has been bad press regarding some of the charities over recent years, and this has led to a number of changes.  The Deputy mentioned that small community groups and elderly people are worried.  The statutory consultative panel on the governance of charitable organisations was established in May 2017 to consider how administration, management and governance can be approved and to make recommendations to the regulator on codes of conduct.  A public consultation process is currently under way and is due to run until December.  Those concerned were in Galway recently.  I can obtain a list for the Deputy of everywhere else in the country that will be involved.<\/p><p>We do not want to scare any elderly people involved in working in the charities sector.  We want a measured response.  As the charities regulator has said, we want a measured response to risk.  Therefore, he is dealing initially with the bigger charities in respect of which complaints are made and where there is information given to him about a specific charity in respect of which there are concerns.<\/p><p>On the issue of funds that might be available, each charity should have a founding charter.  The charities regulator will be able to step in if there is an issue with a charity to ensure funds that are available are being disbursed in the correct manner.<\/p><p>Irish people are very generous with their time and money.  It is a positive step to ensure that whenever they give money to a charity, there will be regulation and good governance.  I met the charities regulator recently as part of my new role.  There is a lot of work done on this.  I stated that the very least people expect regarding every charity is to be able to consult a website to find its accounts and information on its CEO or Accounting Officer.  That information should be available.  It gives comfort to people and demonstrates that everything is being done correctly and within the law.  As I stated, people are very generous and we need to know that their money is put to good use.  <\/p><p>With regard to rural broadband, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the main Department responsible.  What we were doing in our Department is funding rural broadband officers through every local authority.  They are the points of contact for the telecommunications sector and people who have issues and complaints.  They play a key role daily in the improvement of telecommunications and broadband services in general by assisting through engagement with a number of key commercial stakeholders, through participation in the regional action groups facilitated by the Department and through engagement with local communities and businesses.  The officers comprise a dedicated point of contact with the local authority for telecommunications operators.  They are involved at present as part of the mobile phone and broadband task force, which arose through the programme for Government discussions.  The Deputy was involved in the early days himself along with others to advocate on behalf of those in rural Ireland.  The rural broadband officers have emerged from this process.  They are very important.<\/p><p>We recently met telecommunications groups and they believe the rural broadband officers are important with regard to their programme and assisting in identifying State lands that can be used for mobile phone masts.  The matter of exemptions for telecommunications masts concerns the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is legislation in this regard that is quite outdated.  Those concerned are seeking to update it to allow for a greater level of exemption for more modern telecommunications infrastructure.  I believe the officers have a very important role to play.  <\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the Ludgate facility in Skibbereen.  Recently we had an AEC meeting in the Building Block in Sligo town.  It is part of Sligo town but obviously serves a rural community.  It is an innovation hub and centre for people to come to.  It is a private facility.  There is a lot being done on the rolling out of broadband.<\/p><p>On the larger issues concerning the national broadband plan, on 26 September last there was an initial bid involving two companies, namely Eir and Enet.  They are being assessed.  The process is slower than one would like but we do not want to do anything that will end up causing further delays or to have undue preference given to any company.  We need to ensure everything goes through methodically.  I appreciate that the process might be slower than we would wish but we need to ensure it does not give rise to court challenges that might cause delays in the future.  Considerable work was done on mapping the country, down to the level of individual houses.  On <i>broadband.gov.ie<\/i>one can determine what houses have been served under the initial commitment contract with Eir.  Some 300,000 houses have had broadband rolled out to them.  The main complaint received in my office is from houses that are close to the areas where Eir is rolling out broadband.  The broadband might be going up a certain road, but not to every house on it.  The broadband officers in each local authority area are taking note of such complaints.  Where they can make a valid case &mdash; where, for example, there is a school or business close to the end of the broadband line being rolled out by Eir &mdash; it can be examined by Eir.<\/p><p>We want to become the first country where 100% of rural houses are connected to broadband.  It is not as if we are playing catch-up with any other country.  We have particular challenges arising from the low-density population.  We want to see every rural house connected.<\/p><p>Deputy Burke made a number of points on the Dormant Account Fund.  A review of the scheme was due within three years of its being adopted, namely by December 2016.  It has not been carried out.  There was a review in regard to the work programme for the period 2017 to 2019 but the full review that the Comptroller and Auditor General might have recommended has not been carried out.  We intend to carry it out as part of our work programme.<\/p><p>One of the issues is that responsibility for the dormant accounts has been transferred to three Departments in 18 months.  We now have responsibility.  I hope my Department is the permanent home for it.  With regard to the fund itself, &euro;509 million has been transferred thereto since its establishment in 2003.  The net transfers to the fund after repayments where account holders make claims have averaged approximately &euro;26 million per year since 2004.  An action plan was agreed with the Department and signed off by the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, before the transfer of functions.  Under this agreement, Departments can seek to gain access to the funds for disbursement.<\/p><p>Recently, I signed off on access for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  A number of other bodies will be making submissions to me for signing off as well.  There is a pot of money available and strict guidelines over where it can be spent, for example, disadvantaged communities and educational disadvantage.  We will await further claims from Departments for disbursement moneys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#M00200","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1568,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their presentations.  I wish them well in their work.<\/p> <p>  Many Departments deal with the issue of rural Ireland.  The Minister and Minister of State come from rural Ireland and understand it.  In terms of budgets, stamp duty and so on, could this committee or the Ministers present ask the Taoiseach for their Department to be allowed to rural proof every proposal or be given a veto when other Departments take measures that would not help rural Ireland?  For example, agriculture is a major part of rural Ireland and the Ministers present understand it.  Could we have a system in which they would have the main say and be able to block or, to be positive, improve something?<\/p> <p>  As for planning, can the Ministers do anything about the attempt to prevent one-off housing?  Have they any say in the matter?  It is good to see people returning to work but areas are struggling to keep workers for the schemes the Department is trying to deliver such as T&uacute;s, the CE scheme and the rural social scheme, RSS,  In fairness, however, the number of RSS workers has increased.  A guillotine drops in that if people have their year, three years or whatever done, they are gone.  That problem is not the responsibility of the Ministers but it is not being addressed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Could they influence the issue?  The amount of work that is done by Tidy Towns groups and so on in rural areas is incredible.<\/p> <p>  I commend our guests on the local improvement scheme, LIS.  If possible, it should be announced earlier in the year, money should be made available for participants who can meet the percentage threshold by June or July and the work should be hit in the back end.  Galway County Council has moved well on this but, in fairness to councils, the scheme is announced in September or whenever, documents are then received and participants are finally told whether their roads will be done.  However, they might not be able to gather enough money and the Department will have to move on to the next road.  Could we address the window of opportunity?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I sat down in Athlone.  From Limerick to Dublin to Newry to Belfast and from Cork to Dublin to Newry to Belfast, the west of Ireland was taken out of TEN-T funding by the current Taoiseach in 2012.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to cover the Border, midlands and western region with TEN-T funding.  This does not pertain to the Department of Rural and Community Development but while its Ministers have been trying to get rural Ireland thriving, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has been doing nothing in this regard.  The programme for Government commits to helping that area of the country.  Can the Ministers do anything in this regard?<\/p> <p>  What are the Ministers' views on the national planning framework?  I made a submission and held meetings in seven counties.  On reading it, I may as well not have gone anywhere.  Could the Ministers have some input into it?<\/p> <p>  I agree we cannot grab local authorities by the neck and tell them to spend money but there needs to be accountability.  If someone is not doing his or her job in a local authority with regard to providing services to people, questions must be asked of that person's capability to do the job.<\/p> <p>  In terms of rural Ireland, the Department of Rural and Community Development is caught between a rock and a hard place but we need infrastructure.  Given where they are from, the Ministers are well aware of that.  Plans have been drawn up for the Atlantic economic corridor but we need only listen to the news.  Yesterday, for example, we heard that &euro;100 million was going to be spent on trains for somewhere else.  Fair play, and that is good, but we are hearing that we are going to lose trains in our part of the country.  Where can the Ministers make an input?  Will the Taoiseach give them the power that is required?  I have known the Minister for a while.  If he has money, he will spend it, and the Minister of State is trying his best.

Can something be done in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I attended the agriculture committee yesterday, which discussed a new EU regulation on fisheries and catch that has to be thrown out of a boat.

Every member of the committee is a part of the rural framework.  The Ministers know how important rural communities are and how many feel left behind and isolated.  I do not need to give the Minister any advice, but it is important that he not be stymied in his work or become a prisoner of bureaucracy.  I do not believe that he has ever been partial to that.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues have been raised.  My colleague, Deputy Burke, was correct.  When I was a local authority member and there was a local improvement scheme, I raised hell and high water.  It is up to local authority members to ensure that their share of the money from the November Estimates is provided.  What is going on?  Westmeath County Council is still proactive in terms of the LIS.  Abolishing that scheme was the greatest scandal ever.  It was the only way that people living down boreens in the back of God knows where could get a road.  I know of people who had been left out of places until we got them into the scheme.  I would not worry about these roads - they were the best.  I have returned to a road that was done 20 years ago.  It is still in place.  They are brilliant roads.  They carry tractors and everything else.  The cost-benefit analysis of LIS is positive.  If the Department's officials are worried about it, they should not be.  Let their hair go grey about something else instead.  The LIS is very positive.<\/p> <p>  The health boards left a notorious mess when they did away with the small grants for people to install back ramps, doors or toilets in their houses.  Those grants were positive, but someone in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office or somewhere else decided that there was not enough supervision or the like.  Those things could be done locally within three or four weeks without bureaucracy.  The first question a bureaucrat asks is about how not to do something rather than how to do it.  Let us be clear on that.  I want the Minister to clear out many of these obstacles.<\/p> <p>  I am disappointed to hear about Leader.  I have no interest in Leader now because I agree with my colleagues.  The last thing anyone wants to do is get into the claptrap of form filling.  Not everyone is computer literate.  The people on the ground are giving it their best.  Let us advocate for them.  Not all of them are whizz kids getting 650 points.  They have been the backbone of rural Ireland helping to keep us going.  Having so much form filling is ridiculous.<\/p> <p>  I support a group that has received a bit of money through Leader.  That is welcome.  It has come into an additional bit of money and will use it on improving a building that does not relate to the grant.  Due to the bureaucracy of the scheme, however, that might not be possible.  I will give an example.  A group gets &euro;40,000 from the Department through Leader to carry out work and it gets &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 from someone else to undertake different enhancement work.  The new money is not grant aided.  The group was just lucky to get that money from someone else, although not a State body.  We will call it \"private\".<\/p><p>I hope those responsible for Leader will not stop that group, any Leader group or anybody else.  I will bring down the place if I hear that and tear lumps out of somebody in the D&aacute;il, because I will not stand for that type of nonsense.  Deputy Burke and I have spoken about the N4, which is going into the west of Ireland, right through from Bunbrosna.  We have everything ready, including corridors and so on.  We are ready to rock.  That will bring one to Sligo, will open up into Donegal and will go across to Castlebar.  It is an important arterial road and network.  Fair play to Westmeath County Council for the N52.  We have to take a bow.  It goes from Delvin to Kilbeggan and tremendous work has been done on it.  That is the main north east to south west arterial route right through the country and we have to try to get money for it.  There are plenty of places where we can spend money.<\/p><p> The Royal Canal is one of the most important projects ever undertaken in this country.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was involved as a Minister and the current President of Ireland was involved.  The restoration of the Royal Canal was one of the most important projects ever to take place with regard to tourism.  It is a wonderful amenity for tourism, leisure and general activity.  Thousands of people go to it and good money was spent on it.  There is a small spur of the Royal Canal which leads into Longford town, however, and money is needed to complete that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#N00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#O00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>Am I right?

Let us complete the footpaths from Abbeyshrule to Clondra.  This is what we get for the Royal Canal and for the Grand Canal.  This is all joined up.  We have everything there.  Thousands of people go to it.<\/p> <p>  I have been advocating the Sparkassen model and I wore the Minister's head out.  I know he has great patience listening to me.  I have been advocating this as something that is safe and will not compete with the credit unions or post offices but will complement them.  I know the Kerr report is available and we are still waiting for its implementation.  That was a tremendous report.  I will be partial and say that we did great work on that in government.  Bobby Kerr brought forward great recommendations but, whatever happens, people become paralysed the minute a report is available.  They throw it up and never want to see it again.  A good, proactive report was produced and now the Sparkassen model has been raised, with German people coming in, who attended a committee about finance and such.  We were advocating such a system long before some of those people heard of it.  I asked the Minister a question about in the D&aacute;il.  I am advocating it.  We have a pilot project ready in the midlands that will take this on.  We need to get money to small entrepreneurs that Deputies Fitzmaurice and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v were talking about.  The banks are still not lending to those small people.  If the post office never comes together, with this, small businesses have an opportunity to get financial assistance.  The Sparkassen model does not want to take over anything.  It just wants to help, mentor and provide.  I think that is an ideal opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I hate to have to raise this.  Safety in rural Ireland is awful.  I heard an awful story yesterday evening from part of my constituency.  It is frightening that elderly people have been robbed three times in the last two years.  Their jeep was stolen two years ago.  They were robbed again three weeks ago and again at the weekend.  They live in a rural area in County Westmeath.  Their son rang me in an awful state.  It is frightening how elderly people who have helped to build this country, members of a farming community, say they feel threatened, unsafe and frightened.  I do not know if it is in the Minister's remit but will CCTV, security and technology improvements be installed on advanced roadways, major networks and such?  It is a sad day when we have to even ask the Minister about this.  What has become of us as a people when we have to do this to try to help and protect our people who live in the hearts of our communities and who made a major contribution all their lives?<\/p> <p>  On the matter of broadband, what is Eir up to?  Outside Mullingar, I know a businesswoman who lives beside her brother, right next door.  There is a pole and infrastructure to facilitate her.  She does not get the broadband and her brother does and she is a businesswoman.  They are as close together as Deputy Fitzmaurice and I are at present.  How can Eir justify that?  I think its members sit above in an administrative office like this, drawing lines and saying that is where a service will stop, using this new Eircode or whatever else.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, should call Eir's representatives in and ask them to account for that nonsense.  The rural area of my own village of Ballynacargy is covered by the broadband service, which stops at Sonna which is where my wife is from, so that is brave.  The village of Ballynacargy with businesses such as garages and other new ones trying to start up, was not covered.  The service did not come down the road to where there is a big population.  One would want to sack those in Eir, not give them more, for the way they have behaved.  They should be put out.  I have good friends working there and they cannot understand it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#O00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>I will give one example that came up yesterday.

I will answer Deputy Fitzmaurice first.  He spoke about rural proofing.  It is a very valid point.  Every other day, we get memos from Government with regard to what has been proposed by other Ministers.  My officials and I have to watch these memos come in because these are what will determine the decision.  I have to make observations on these on a regular basis.  If we cannot get agreement on an official level, then it comes to the Cabinet table.  I have a role.  I have heard Deputy Fitzmaurice raise this previously and I note other Ministers have a role too.  It is not just one Minister.  Each Minister has an obligation to ensure plans are Border-proof, poverty-proof and so on.  I have to make sure, at every opportunity I get, with every issue that comes through, that we make an observation on it.  It is a valid point.  I do not have direct control over every Minister.  Every Minister has his or her own Department and every Department runs its affairs independently but if I make a recommendation on changes, legislation or any schemes I am bringing in, I have to bring a memo to Government in order that other Ministers can make an observation with regard to what I am doing.  It is a valid point that I have to keep looking at.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins, who is absent, raised the issues of rural social schemes, community schemes and so on.  I have been speaking to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and recently we had meetings with the officials at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection about these schemes and other issues.  While unemployment levels are falling, these communities are dependent on these schemes.  These people do an excellent job for the community with the little funding they get and I would like to see changes to assist and leave these people in place for longer.  In some cases, it may be the only job some of these people will ever get.<\/p><p>They see it as a job and it gives them a reason for getting up in the morning and go out.

If we had not the rural social schemes, we would have a serious problem.  The Deputy is quite correct as there is now the problem of people being able to stay on it longer.  I am talking to the Minister in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will deal with the broadband matters.  We spoke about the national plan and infrastructure earlier and we can speak about it again.  I will answer Deputy Penrose's questions in a moment.  The time has come for infrastructure to start rolling out in rural Ireland.  The Deputy is quite correct.  There was mention of the Tuam to Gort bypass, which has given a great lift to Galway.  The Government recently announced the Limerick to Cork project.  We need the process to continue so as to have a route from Tuam to Claremorris and on to Sligo, Letterkenny and the North.  We must work on the N4 and N5, and I know there has been progress because I met representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland recently about the Roscommon section.  It has been held up too long with problems.  The project should have been up and running for the past 20 years but at least now there is a bit of progress being made.  It is one of the recommendations I have put in for the national plan.  We need a motorway from Dublin that runs past Mullingar to the west of Ireland and Longford.  It must be done and we should take it up as an issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies spoke about local improvement scheme, LIS, roads and I will respond to both of them.  I reduced rates from 20% down to 15% if there were five houses or more, and to 10% if there were fewer houses.  The Deputies raised this.  The local authorities are not making any contributions and they should.  We are making our portion available and communities are making their 10% and 15% available.  There was an issue when I was at the Department dealing with transport regarding the resources that the local authorities check in every day.  They could make an allocation of their own funding to the LIS, which they should.  To be fair, I know for every Deputy this is seen as one of the better schemes.  It is the only scheme for some people to get the road into their house done.  As I stated, these people pay their taxes and water charges.  Nine times from ten they may not even be connected to a mains water supply.  They are entitled to get some contribution for their roads.  This is a scheme I started and I would like to build on it.  I do not see any reason the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot come up with a further process to put a bit of funding into the LIS.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, should be brought before the committee and it could be discussed with him.  It should not be left to me and he should put some funding into it as well.  That Department has a massive budget so if it made a contribution, along with my Department, local authorities and the people in the area, it would be helpful.  It is something that should be done.<\/p> <p>  I have dealt with \"rural-proofing\".

This is a very important plan.  I am not sure if the previous rural affairs committee had the Department officials before them but I suggest, as a priority but with respect to the committee, that officials within the housing Department be invited in with regard to the national planning framework.  It is at the end of preparation stages and the Department has made a strong case for a number of areas.  I know the chief executive officers in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, if not Roscommon as well, have asked under the national planning framework that Sligo be identified as a driver in the north west.  I particularly agree with that and if the letter has not been sent, I know I have prepared one for the Taoiseach on that basis.  As has been pointed out on many occasions, north of the line from Galway to Dublin there is no city at present, as we understand, and we need to encourage a strong growth centre in a region like Sligo.  There are many other places that will grow organically within the Dublin region or in the midlands in close proximity to road and rail.  We hope that if it happens there will be an added stimulus to the infrastructure that is needed, whether this is the motorways or western rail corridor, which was also included in the submission we made in support of that project.  The continuation to Tuam, Claremorris and onwards is supported in our submission.<\/p><p>The national planning framework is very important to role of the Atlantic economic corridor as well.  It is strongly of the view that the north-west region must be clearly identified in the national planning framework and the capital plan for investment.  We have made our submissions and the Minister will be fighting for this at Cabinet.  I raised this within our own party but the other Department is taking the lead.  I respectfully advise that an early discussion on the national planning framework would be in order.<\/p><p>The Trans-European Transport Networks in Europe, TEN-T, has been raised with me by the chambers and Galway has done much work on it.  There were recent meetings in Brussels about it.  This is something we must progress and I hope to see it relating to the Atlantic economic corridor as well.  I do not have the latest on it but I will certainly get an update for the Deputy on this.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, made recent comments to Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, and I will try to get the pertinent comments on that.  There are particular issues with Galway Port and the port policy, that is up for review again.  The island of Malta has five TEN-T ports and we have been left out on the west coast.  It is important as well.  Deputies mentioned discards in fisheries, which are not under my remit.  I am responsible for inland fisheries but not the marine sector.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, worked on that when he had responsibility for the marine but I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with it.<\/p><p>Deputy Penrose has the example of a house being a business and Eir, with respect to the company, should be facilitating this.

I propose that the committee invites the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to attend a debate where we discuss what is happening at present.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, mentioned that one can contact the country broadband officer.  In Country Galway thousands of queries about broadband have been lodged.  A good number of them were lodged by my office, and I am sure the same applies to his office.  The queries are about instances where broadband only goes so far and gaps abound.  We are not going to solve the problem here.  I estimate that 4,000 queries have been submitted in County Galway.  If that situation is replicated over 31 local authorities then one will know the size of the problem.  Discrimination has also taken place.  Eir has told me that it does not have the capacity, or the juice in the line, to bring the scheme any further.  Yet people in business can see from their windows that a house 50 yards further along cannot get a broadband connection.  That situation is replicated all over the country.  We need to invite the Minister here to debate the issue.

I have also dealt with the query about the local improvement scheme, LIS.<\/p><p>I am sure members have read about public banking.  I have answered questions about the matter in the D&aacute;il.  The Programme for a Partnership Government envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, such as the Kiwi bank model in New Zealand, which could be delivered through the post office network.  The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German <i>Sparkassen<\/i>model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions.<\/p><p>My officials have actively worked with the Department of Finance to progress the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Earlier this year a project team was assembled and officials from both Departments have actively worked together to finalise the analysis.  In addition, a public consultation process, seeking views on the community banking model, was launched in early March and ran for four weeks.  A total of 16 replies were received from a range of stakeholders.  Both Departments have also met representatives from the <i>Sparkassen<\/i>Foundation for International Co-operation in order to get a better understanding of how the model operates in Germany.  Officials from both Departments are now finalising their analysis and a report will be submitted to both Ministers shortly. <\/p><p>The issue of safety in the home was raised.  Recently, I announced that &euro;2.3 million has been allocated to the senior alert scheme.  I have made it easier this year for people aged 65 years and upwards to join the scheme.  In the past people could only join if they lived alone but that does not apply anymore.  I have conducted a national campaign on local media, national media and local radio stations to promote the scheme.  Pobal will run a few shows around the country to encourage people to join the scheme.  I call on people who know an elderly person or someone who would benefit from the scheme to help them to fill out their applications and submit them.  I wish to confirm that all of the equipment is free.  There is no charge for the pendant supplied whether it is worn on one's arm or neck.  In addition, monitoring is free for the first year and there is a small for the second year onwards.  I encourage people to avail of the scheme.  <\/p><p>In terms of CCTV, the Minister for Justice and Equality recently announced a scheme and he has announced it again.  CCTV is very important and the scheme has been simplified a bit.  Recently, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I launched a new helpline for all other mobile phones but not the iPhone.  The scheme allows for people who have called for assistance to be located on a map.  It is terrible that elderly people have been attacked in their homes.  Such a situation is outrageous.  We must do everything in our power to protect them and ensure they can live in the comfort of their own homes.  That is why I encourage people to join the senior alert scheme.  I know that the Garda is considering more ways and means to make the most of the scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#Q02400","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1612,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and we are discussing programme A that deals with rural development and regional affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2017111500002#Q02500","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1510736400,"counter":1613,"content":"<p>I refer to subhead A.3 on dormant account measures.

This year, for example, of the &euro;11 million spent on Leader, more than &euro;10 million relates to administration, amounting to 90% of overall costs.  I would never throw that at the Minister because I know it levels off over time.  We are now at &euro;11 million, with a few hundred thousand euro already paid out under Leader.  How much of the &euro;30 million does the Minister expect will be spent?  That figure was reduced and I do not agree with Deputy Nolan's view on that.  I believe that the Minister was right to take the money out of Leader.  Otherwise, it would have gone back to the Exchequer and I would certainly not give any money back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform if I could avoid doing so.  I encouraged the Minister repeatedly with regard to the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I encouraged the Minister to set it up and believe he was right to divert the money.

I do not want to make a political issue out of it.  Sometimes we can get entrenched very easily in political spats on issues like these.  Next door to Leinster House is a building which we look at every day.  There are staff in that building who have had difficulties in respect of bullying and harassment for the past ten years.  There is an ocean of evidence detailing this.  The Minister is aware of that ocean of evidence.  It includes the disputed protected disclosure; the disputed letter which was not signed and did not have legal standing; the stacks of reports which have been made to consultants and to HR; the bringing in of the Rape Crisis Centre; psychotherapists stating that major difficulties were ongoing; and the massive amount of money which has been spent on legal battles.  I am aware of a legal battle in which two State agents spent &euro;110,000 in the High Court in a battle against one another over whether a particular staff member was employed by the Department.  Former directors of the National Museum of Ireland have spoken about fierce misogyny within the organisation.  I have never come across a list so long detailing such a negative culture within an organisation.<br\/><br\/>I understand that it is a difficult space for a Minister to get into.  I understand that, first and foremost, the HR departments in those organisations are directly responsible for fixing those issues.  However, the truth of the matter is a young woman still has to come out in front of the newspapers, something that is very difficult to do, to seek justice.  We saw that just this weekend in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>, the Irish <i>Daily Mail<\/i>and <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  In respect of the issues around the Gate Theatre, the Government might have an excuse as that issue arose from left field to a certain extent.  The Government might say that it did not realise the difficulties in that area, but the issues in the National Museum are different.  The Minister's predecessor and the Minister herself have been inundated with information on this since 2010.  The Government cannot say that it did not know.  In a way, there is some level of complicity on the Government's part because it has been saturated with information on this issue.  I would like to tease this out with the Minister.  Is there anything more we can do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>As the Chairman knows, the National Museum of Ireland is dealing with a number of legacy HR issues relating to matters that took place a number of years ago.  The board and management are taking steps to address these issues.  The Chairman mentioned the newspapers at the weekend.  That lady came forward with her story and I commend her on doing so.  She was talking about something which commenced as early as 2006.  I have consistently been clear that I cannot get involved in HR matters.  They are a matter for the executive and the board of the museum.  I am bound to respect the statutory independence put in place by the Oireachtas under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  Section 31 of the Act makes clear that staff of the museum are staff of the board and the board is independent in its function.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding these legal limitations, I have actively provided additional support in dealing with the legacy issues the museum faces.  My Department has sanctioned three specific HR positions and two temporary positions for the corporate services area of the museum to assist in the process.  I have been very supportive of the chair and the new board.  They were appointed in 2006.  I have been working with them since then to support them in implementing change in the museum as well as preparing new plans to improve the museum's services to the public over the coming years.  When I invited expressions of interest for the board, I specifically sought broad corporate experience, including corporate governance and business management, including HR.<\/p> <p>  What appeared in the newspapers last weekend is not new news, as both the Chairman and I know.

I cannot understand why the same urgency was not applied with regard to the National Museum of Ireland issue.  In a couple of the debates that we have around this issue, the Minister quoted section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003 which states, \"The Council shall be independent in the performance of its functions\".  The next words are \"under this section\".  This section refers to stimulating public interest in the arts, promoting knowledge, appreciation of practice of the arts, improving standards of the arts and otherwise assisting in the development or the advancement of the arts.  We would all agree that independence in those spaces is good.  The reason which the Minister has given for not getting more involved does not pertain to the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Workplace Relations Act 2015 or the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  My instinct would be that there is a necessity for accountability in this space.  We know that wrongdoing proliferates when there is no accountability.  We know also that this wrongdoing has been going on for a long time in some of these organisations.  If it were in the Minister's design to reduce the funding which some of these organisations receive, not on the basis of the Arts Act 2003 but on the basis of the workers' rights legislation, would that not have the effect of improving the working experience of men and women in those organisations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>As the Chairman will be aware, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.

I understand there are a number of conditions applicable to financial assistance provided by the council.  These conditions include a requirement that recipients comply with all laws applicable to the body in question, including statutory obligations under employment law, statutes, regulations and Revenue requirements.  In addition, recipients must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard to the need to promote equal opportunities in all areas of work in compliance with the provisions of the Employment Equality Acts 1998  to 2001.   I will not apply conditions to Arts Council funding.  Following on from discussions which I have had with the Arts Council I know that it is very cognisant of these requirements and that it will again highlight to the organisations to which they provide funding the need to comply with these laws.

I have a number of questions on programme A - arts, culture and film.  As outlined by the Minister the allocation for Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca was &euro;1.25 million, which was a huge success and a flagship project nationally.  An allocation of &euro;0.6 million was provided to RT&Eacute; to, produce, deliver and curate Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca and &euro;850,000 was set aside to enable the OPW to organise the event in terms of logistics, security, event control etc..  Perhaps the Minister would provide us with a breakdown of the artists who participated in this event and what they received in monetary terms.  Also, will this be an annual event going forward and, if so, how much will artists gain from it in terms of support?<\/p><p>A total of &euro;0.9 million has been allocated for citizens' engagement.  The Creative Ireland supplement in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>is a huge part of that.  They are both PR exercises for Creative Ireland.  What do the artists gain from such expenditure or the events that are promoted?<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to comment further on the festivals partnership which got an overall allocation of &euro;0.49 million.  Some wonderful festivals have taken place such as the Dalkey book festival, the Galway Arts Festival, the Kilkenny Arts Festival and the Dublin Theatre Festival, among others.  The expenditure to date is &euro;350,000.  Could the Minister provide a clear outline on how Creative Ireland funding was made available to the directors of those festivals and what was involved in the application procedure?<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to provide an update on the administration costs of Creative Ireland.  The director, John Concannon, has moved on to the Taoiseach's office.  I would like a brief outline on the position in terms of his replacement and the continuation of Creative Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Harassment and bullying comes under this section.  The point we were trying to make in the D&aacute;il yesterday and that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n tried to make here today is that while nobody wants the Minister to interfere with the decisions of the Arts Council on where funding is allocated, if an arts organisation in Cavan or Monaghan or elsewhere in the country makes an application to the Arts Council for funding certain boxes would have to be ticked before the application is even considered.  I refer to child protection, health and safety and other such issues.  I am sure the Minister would agree with committee members that harassment and bullying should be of the utmost importance when we see what has transpired and the revelations that have come about in reputable cultural organisations and institutions.  The question is whether the Minister will ensure that the Arts Council has a brief and meets criteria in terms of the successful applicants to whom it allocates funding, that it ticks the boxes and ensures there are policies in place that not only support and protect staff but facilitates them to speak up, have a voice and not live in fear.  Getting funding should be contingent on the fact that such an important box would be ticked on any application form.  The Minister has a role to play in that regard.  It is not a question of asking the Minister to interfere with the decisions of the Arts Council but of asking her to ensure that a policy on the very important issue of harassments and bullying is in place before any cultural institution or arts organisation would be even considered for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#C01300","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1745,"content":"<p>I will answer the last question first.

There were no increases for many years and we all would have preferred to have more.  I hope we will be able to see these increases continue  year on year.<\/p><p>Let me draw attention to the following.  The new cultural and heritage centre at College Green, Dublin will be a fantastic asset and will add to the whole cultural offering in the city.  We take for granted the fact that entry to many of the cultural institutions are free.  If one goes abroad, one must pay to visit museums and galleries.  When people come to Dublin, they cannot believe they can have access to all of these amazing places.  Will that be the approach in this centre?  It would be marvellous to have a Seamus Heaney exhibition there because he is a cultural icon, both nationally and internationally.  <\/p><p>I understand that under the culture plan, each local authority will have a culture team.  Is the Minister engaging with the local authority culture teams to see what their work programmes are?  Does she have ongoing engagement with the culture teams?  I ask because these teams are so important in the delivery of Creative Ireland as the arts officers and the heritage officers really have their fingers on the pulse of what is going on in their counties.  It is really important that it is ongoing.<\/p><p>I have had a look at the excellent Creative Ireland website,<i>Ireland.ie.  <\/i>Is there scope to expand on that website?  There are fantastic artists, writers and people involved in the cultural life of Ireland who might well be available for work or to participate, whether nationally or internationally.  Would it be possible to have a section of the website direct the public to artists who register on it?  I think it might be worthwhile to look at broadening the capacity.  There was a great outcome to the celebration of the 2016 year of commemorations and the fact that communities really embraced this in such a positive way took everybody by surprise.  While everyone knew it would be driven by the Government and the local authorities, to see communities really looking at their history and having enactments with adults and children really participating in an engaged way was a marvellous outcome.  It was a little surprising because I do not believe people really expected the level of community engagement, which was really marvellous.<\/p><p>I was appalled to hear about the alleged harassment which has been revealed recently.  The approach the Minister has taken in dealing with it has been positive and constructive.  She has taken control of it, putting procedures in place rather than waiting for something to evolve.  I am trying to get my head around the points made by the Chairman and Deputy Niamh Smyth about people who were funding cultural organisations or indeed any organisation.  To clarify, is it being suggested that those who are providing funding to outside organisations, be they agencies or whatever, should get involved in issues that fall under employment legislation?  If that be the case, would it apply to the political parties that are funded by the Houses of the Oireachtas?  If there was a difficulty within a political party, does that mean the funder would get involved?  Is that the direction in which the members are going in this regard?  Employment law is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#E01100","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>Let me suggest a platform in which this could be done in the context of non-compliance with employment law in the State.

The exhibition is well under way and we hope it will open in mid-2018.  Entry to the exhibition will be free.  It adds further to the cultural offering in the centre of the city, which is great.<\/p> <p>  I must say that culture teams in local authorities are doing wonderful work on behalf of the Creative Ireland programme, again connecting with communities and getting more people to engage with culture and creativity.  Every single local authority has drawn up a culture plan for its county and is now looking at a five-year strategy.  We are working with them to develop a five-year plan for culture and creativity in every single county across the country.  <\/p> <p>  It is easy to pick out specific things but when we started the Creative Ireland initiative, we were building on the 2016 initiative and the major interest that people have in culture and creativity.<\/p><p>The substance of the Creative Ireland initiative is creative children and communities, building more collaboratively on existing initiatives and working with all stakeholders to put culture and creativity at the centre of public policy and the heart of Irish society.  It was a new concept and that is why we worked with different stakeholders.  The Arts Council is a key partner in the Creative Ireland programme.  It has a specific remit in terms of promoting the arts.  <\/p><p> I have key responsibilities in the area and would not, in any way, interfere with the independence of the Arts Council and would in no way dilute its role.  I will continue to work on it.  Creative Ireland has more than a purely arts focus.  It is about encouraging citizens to explore a wider creative agenda through access to the arts, although access to the arts is a key aspect.  <\/p><p> Another key aspect of the programme has been working with local authorities and supporting voluntary groups which are trying to engage with citizens in a variety of creative pursuits.. Every county has the plan and is working on it, and I want to continue to support them.  Last year they received &euro;1 million from my Department and this year I intend to double that funding which goes directly to local authorities that make decisions.  I have no input into their decisions; they decide on how best to promote engagement through communities and local events.  <\/p><p> Culture teams comprise museum curators, arts and heritage officers and librarians, and is director-led in local authorities.

Does the Minister's Department have any responsibility, given that the symphony and concert orchestras come under the term \"culture\"?  A review is being carried out in RT&Eacute; and there are concerns that it may seek to in some fashion amalgamate the players in the two orchestras.  I understand that the word in the relevant legislation is \"orchestras\", which would indicate that there is more than one.  There is a big concern that this country's cultural output will be damaged if we lose an orchestra or if the orchestras are amalgamated.  Ireland can very quickly become a cultural satellite of other anglophone countries if we do not develop our own cultural output and self-expression.  This could also lead to difficulties with our own artistic experience and with our own understanding of who we are.

I will open the questions on this.  Programme B refers to Moore Street and I am on the record as having given the Minister credit for the development of the Moore Street consultative forum which is trying to identify a solution to the Moore Street space.  Moore Street is obviously of massive cultural importance to the people but, unfortunately, the location is a sterile environment and has been for years due to the ongoing wrangling between developers, the State, and cultural and heritage organisations.  My major concern is that we are probably going to be looking at a continuation of the legal wrangling for the next three to five years and that quarter at the northern end of O'Connell Street will remain a sterile space.  This would be a major sin for us if that were to be the case because the opportunity exists there, one, to pay respect to the men and women of 1916, two, to bring alive the heritage of that era for Irish people and tourists to experience, and three, to make it a vibrant market space.  This is in our gift and I believe that we should do all that we can to achieve it.  I understand that the property developer, Hammerson, has not engaged with the consultative group so far and that the Minister is meeting it next week.  It would be useful if she could, one, convince Hammerson to really get involved in working as a partner on the future of Moore Street, and two, indicate what tools she might have up her sleeve to encourage Hammerson to do this.  One of the tools could be, for example, that a number of buildings or streets would be identified as preserved national monuments.  That would obviously focus the mind of Hammerson in the future.  Perhaps the Minister could talk about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#G01800","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1838,"content":"<p>I thank the Moore Street consultative forum.  It is something I discussed with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v at the time.  I pay tribute to him on that, because he said he felt that was a good way to bring it forward.  I took his comments on board, set up the forum and put the chairman in place.  This forum has worked very well and I again pay tribute to Mr. Gerry Kearney who chaired that and it did a very good job.  The forum came to me with its report which included the recommendation that we set up an advisory forum.  I have done that now and we have a new chair, Dr. Tom Collins, who is working with the group.  I am arranging a date on which to meet the chairman, Dr. Collins.  I will be meeting the developer, as the Chairman mentioned, to talk to him on how we can engage with the advisory group and also impress upon him how we need to work together.  Hammerson is relatively new to this process, having become the owners of this property not that long ago.  The Chairman can rest assured that I will encourage the developer in every way that I can to work with the advisory group.  As the committee knows, the State owns Nos. 14 to 17, and under direction from the courts, we carried out some very necessary restoration work to weather and protect these buildings.  We have done that, and if we need to go back to do some more work, we will certainly go back to the courts to ask their permission for this, because we have to do that, based on the judgment.  As the committee knows, we appealed the judgment.

For some reason it is proposed that the national Famine commemoration will be in Munster again next year.  Since it was set up, it has always rotated between the four provinces because the Famine was not a local event but a national event which affected the whole island.  Is there any particular reason the Minister has broken with tradition and is having the Famine commemoration in Cork next year rather than up in c&uacute;ige Chonnacht?  What did the people of Galway do?  We were very badly hit by the Famine.  There are some very harrowing descriptions of it from places such as Cois Fharraige.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#H00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1843,"content":"<p>First of all, we had a very successful Famine commemoration this year in Ballingarry.  It was out in quite a remote place.  It was extremely well organised and I pay tribute to the local community there.  It put a huge amount of work into making it a very successful day.  The community was delighted that the Famine commemoration came to its area.  The Taoiseach attended, which was wonderful.  The decision on where Famine events are held is up to the Famine committee.  There is a special committee which looks at the different venues.  Next year is a special year for Cork however.  I was cognisant that there was a tradition of going around the different provinces.  I was conscious of that but there is a special event in University College Cork next year.  Huge effort has been put into launching <i>The Atlas of the Great Irish Famine<\/i>, which is a magnificent book.  Special events are also being held to educate people and to get them more engaged with that period in our history.  It is important that we do that.  There was a lot on in Cork and the committee felt that the commemoration should be held there next year.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that we will revert to the model of rotating between provinces from the year after.  It is a once-off change for next year, but after that we will go back to going around the provinces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017111500002#H00500","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1844,"content":"<p>I hear the Minister's answer but I am still disappointed.  There is an old saying in Irish - n&aacute; d&eacute;an n&oacute;s agus n&aacute; bris n&oacute;s.  Do not make a habit and do not break a habit.  The Minister will get all sorts of special pleading from very powerful elite groups like universities.  The Famine commemoration is meant to be about the communities.  When the first committee met, it purposely decided not to have a fixed location because every community in Ireland suffered.  Some of the more isolated communities had the most harrowing experiences.  That is why they are now isolated, because they lost so much of their populations.  I regret the decision but I accept it.  I look forward to the commemoration in Connacht the following year.  It might be an idea to pick a Gaeltacht area in 2019 for the very simple reason that the demise of the Irish language can be very directly attributed to the Famine.  There has been academic work on this issue.  The language's decline was absolutely spectacular from the year 1841 onwards.  To make up it up to the people of Connacht, the Minister might suggest a Gaeltacht area in 2019 to the committee.

I will make a short address, following which I am happy to take any questions.  I will first outline my career and then my approach and vision as chairperson.<\/p> <p>  I am a seasoned professional with senior management experience gained across industry sectors, particularly infrastructure, waste to energy, regional economic development, investment banking, aviation and transportation, gained over the past 30 years.  I began my career in 1987 working with KPMG for eight years.  I am a chartered accountant and a chartered director.  I hold a bachelor's degree in commerce and an MBA degree.  Most recently, I was the chief financial  officer, CFO, of Shannon Group, where I led the development and implementation of the business plan to consolidate, turnaround, refocus and transform the group and its businesses.  I commenced a &euro;100 million capital investment programme, raised debt from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, for the runway rehabilitation, supported the growth of passengers by 22% and visitors by 29% over three years until the end of 2016, and I rationalised the cost base and improved the profitability of Shannon Group.  I left the group after three and a half years to return to Dublin and I now work as a management consultant specialising in corporate development, M&amp;A deal making, and corporate finance.<\/p> <p>  Prior to working in the Shannon Group, I worked for six years with Indaver, a leading European high tech renewable energy and waste to energy incineration group, as a general manager and finance director.  My key achievement was the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s first incinerator near Drogheda, at a cost of &euro;150 million, which has since transformed the Irish waste management sector.  Between 2001 and 2008, I worked as a specialist on infrastructure development deals, mainly public private partnerships, notably two major Irish toll roads, a major waste water, private finance initiative, PFI, project in Northern Ireland and mixed urban redevelopment projects.  Prior to that, I spent six years at NCB Stockbrokers advising on corporate transactions.  I worked at board level with Shannon Group.  I was a board member at Indaver and I am also currently a non-executive director of Bus &Eacute;ireann and I chair its audit and risk committee.  I brought my skills and experience to bear recently to help Bus &Eacute;ireann restructure and to put it on a sustainable footing.  I developed my knowledge of corporate governance undertaking courses at the Institute of Directors.  I was involved with IBEC, Mid West, on its committee and Shannon Chamber while at Shannon Group.  <\/p> <p>  On a personal front, my motivation in accepting this appointment is to be a good leader and to make a lasting contribution to the company and the region.  I have an affinity with the communities and understanding of the issues and challenges of the west and south of the country, having worked in Shannon and lived in Quin and having grown up in and worked in Cork.  I have extended family living in Kerry, Clare and Cork.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my approach and vision as chairperson, the Shannon Foynes Port Company is responsible for the maritime management of the Shannon Estuary, serving a number of facilities and customers and handling in excess of 11 million tonnes per annum. Shannon Foynes port is the second largest port in the State in terms of total tonnage and profitability and the third largest in terms of turnover.  Connectivity and port capacity are two key themes on which I will focus as chairperson.  In particular, the national ports policy classified the port as a port of national significance.  The port has been also recognised in a European context as being a core port under EU TEN-T guidelines.  I see Shannon Foynes port as having a vital national significance and not just a mid-west significance.  It is critical, therefore, that Shannon Foynes Port Company continues to be run and developed on commercial grounds and that it also recognises the varying interests of all stakeholders in the development and implementation of its strategic plan to deliver increased connectivity and capacity for trade and investment.  The draft national planning framework supports the role of the tier 1 ports and the Limerick to Foynes road upgrade.  I will also focus on re-opening the rail connection from Foynes to Limerick to facilitate mainline rail connectivity and industrial development.<\/p> <p>  My approach as chairperson will be to work with the board of directors, and through the CEO and his management team, on all aspects of the business.  I will focus on good governance ensuring operational excellence and the development and progressive implementation of a strategy to secure investment and growth in the business.  This strategy, where appropriate, will be complementary to and supportive of the overall development of the region and co-ordinated with Government and its agencies' plans to develop the port as a national asset and enabler of socio-economic development of significant scale in such areas as energy, natural resources, agriculture, manufacturing and processing.  My initial meeting with the CEO of the company has been reassuring that a focused and professional approach is in place and my objective is to contribute to building and consolidating this approach. <\/p> <p>  In terms of business strategic vision, the shipping sector is becoming more globalised.  Shannon Foynes Port Company's business strategy must, therefore, identify, pursue and deliver new global opportunities and expand the scale of its existing activities to ensure its growth and survival.  Global business development and investment are also key themes that I will focus on as chairperson.  Shannon Foynes Port Company has an ambitious strategic plan set out in its master plan vision 2041 document.  This master plan covers the growth and development options for the port for the 30 year period to 2041.  The sustainable implementation of the master plan encompasses capacity and land optimisation, transport and multi-modal connectivity, society and  community integration along with environmental considerations.  The capital expenditure programme in the master plan is projected to involve an investment of some &euro;1.8 billion, of which the port company will invest &euro;126 million.  This will position Shannon Foynes port to capture ongoing growth and new global sources of growth, foreign direct investment, FDI, and support economic and social development in which I keenly believe.  The development of infrastructure at Foynes port in tandem with the Limerick to Foynes road scheme and rail line will add significant capacity and direct alternative connectivity to and from Europe and the rest of the world enabling the Shannon Foynes Port Company to compete and capture global business opportunities.  This infrastructure capacity and direct connectivity will reduce uncertainty and potential customs delays caused by Brexit as the infrastructure now being developed at Shannon Foynes port could facilitate direct multi-modal links to Europe and beyond by completely bypassing the UK land bridge.  In addition, this realignment of the supply chain toward Foynes port leverages the substantial Government road investments, undertaken and planned.  I also will be focused on the development of Limerick Docks and alternative uses for its surplus lands.<\/p> <p>  My approach is to ensure good corporate governance, meeting or exceeding the shareholder expectations for a dividend - financial, economic or social - and to have a realistic strategic plan which adds tangible benefits to its many stakeholders.<\/p><p>My ambition is to deliver this in the context of a strong unified board working in harmony with the CEO and his team, with good relationships and support from the appropriate external bodies and working co-operatively and transparently with the local community, businesses and other stakeholders.<\/p><p> That summarises my vision, approach and career experience.  I will be happy to take questions on any aspects of those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1917,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which is meeting next door so I will have to leave.  I might not be able to stay for the responses but I will note them when I get them.<\/p> <p>  I warmly welcome Mr. McGarry and congratulate him on his appointment.  I know a great deal about Shannon Foynes Port Company because, in one guise or another, I was a director on the River Shannon from the days of the old harbour commissioners up to when I was elected to the Seanad.  I did that for 16 years so I am familiar with the company.  The Shannon Foynes Port Company is very important infrastructure not just for the mid-west but for the nation.  I have nothing but admiration for the work being done there by Mr. McGarry, his predecessor, the chief executive, Pat Keating, and the board members.  It is a fantastic facility and a great working environment.  It is not far from the Kerry border and many of my constituents have secured good, meaningful, long-term employment there.  We always say that what is good for Foynes is good for Kerry.<\/p> <p>  The rail link between Limerick and Foynes is very important for the growth of the harbour.  I wish Mr. McGarry well with that.  I have a question about Foynes Island.  I am out of touch now but it had been suggested that Foynes Island might be acquired by the port company to give it further potential.  What is the position with that?  Is there a possibility of movement on that, if the company does not have it already?  It would be important to secure more space.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the gas project.  People in Kerry had been very hopeful about the liquefied natural gas, LNG, project for a long time but there has been some disappointing news of late.  Foynes has a huge role to play in the provision of gas and ensuring our energy security into the future.  Will Mr. McGarry comment on the current position of Foynes on that project and how he sees it growing in terms of a storage facility for gas into the future?  I welcome the fact that there is now a gas supply line directly to Listowel, where I am from, from Foynes.  The Kerry Group is very involved with that as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. McGarry well.  The reports about him are very good.  I will note his responses in the report of these proceedings.  I must go to attend an important meeting of the other committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#C00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1920,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McGarry.  His curriculum vitae is quite impressive.  He has built up a vast amount of experience during his working life, which is welcome.  I admire the reasons he wishes to return and give something back to this company.<\/p><p>Was the position advertised on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>?  Did Mr. McGarry apply for the job through <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>?  If so, did he have to undergo any interviews and, if so, how many?<\/p><p>I have been on this committee for almost two years and this is possibly the first time the marine sector has been before the committee.  Sometimes we forget about it but it is an important industry.  In 2012, it had a turnover of &euro;4.2 billion and was a net contributor of &euro;1.3 billion to our GDP, which is almost 0.7% of GDP.  That is extremely important, no more so than now in the context of Brexit and the need for improved connectivity for our agrifood, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.  Mr. McGarry referred to the Limerick-Foynes rail line.  Representatives of Irish Rail appeared before the committee a few weeks ago when they identified, and we know it from national media reports, the serious and precarious financial situation of the company.  Has Mr. McGarry had any interaction with them?  Is this a pipe dream or is it realistic?  There is also the upgrade of the Limerick to Foynes road.  The port is part of the TEN-T network.  Could Irish Rail and Transport Infrastructure Ireland avail of EU funding to help advance both of these projects?<\/p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the LNG project.  This nation is 95% dependent on the UK for gas supply.  Even in 2025 we will still be 85% dependent on the UK.  Has the port made provision for importing liquefied natural gas?  What is it doing with regard to its role in the storage of natural gas?  A few months ago the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, indicated that both the import and storage of liquefied natural gas are under serious consideration by his Department.  The European Commission produced a paper a number of years ago entitled Europe's Seaports 2030: Challenges Ahead.  One of the challenges is predicted high growth.  With even modest assumptions of economic growth port cargo volumes are expected to increase by 50% by 2030.  It is even more for the fast growing traffic of containers.  How is the port equipped to deal with the prediction of high growth?  The paper also refers to the challenges of the nature of shipping, with the size and complexity of the fleet increasing.  Ultra large container ships are appearing as well as new types of roll-on\/roll-off ferries and gas containers.  Energy trades are changing, with a shift from oil and refined products towards gas, and there is the deployment of bigger vessels for short sea shipping.  How does Mr. McGarry think his port is equipped to deal with the changing nature of shipping?<\/p><p>The paper produced by the EU Commission included an action plan with eight specified actions.  I am sure Mr. McGarry is aware of it.  Will he comment on how he proposes to implement those actions or are all of them relevant to the port?<\/p><p>How does the port comply with the new International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, weight certification from the International Maritime Organisation?<\/p><p>I have a question about Mr. McGarry's role on the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  How long was he a member of the board?  He said he is pleased with how he contributed to the restructuring of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, we read in the newspapers yesterday that there is potential for further strike action in Bus &Eacute;ireann due to some of the restructuring of which he was pleased to be a part.  I am not trying to lay the blame on Mr. McGarry exclusively.  We accept that something had to be done with Bus &Eacute;ireann, but it is still not resolved.  It is still a big issue.  While the maritime industry has not been on the committee's agenda for two years, Bus &Eacute;ireann certainly was.  It is an issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people daily.  Perhaps Mr. McGarry will share his insights with the committee on how, as a member of the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann, he envisages it being put on a sustainable footing and also on how to get buy-in from the people we rely on to ensure that Bus &Eacute;ireann is effective, reliable and fit for purpose in terms of serving the passengers who rely on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#C00500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1921,"content":"<p>There were plenty of questions.

This part of the estuary is ideal in terms of location and Moneypoint and Tarbert are in the area, apart from which the lands of Ballylongford are very suited to this type of activity.  I am sure it will be looked at again.  The board of the port is monitoring the situation.  It is not going ahead at the moment but there is potential to look at it again in the future.  I will develop it with the board in due course.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about becoming chairman-designate.  The post was advertised through the State boards.

In due course it will make applications to fund further development of Foynes Port and up to 20% of capital investment can be secured from Europe for this purpose. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1929,"content":"<p>Is that 20% grant aid or is it available at variable interest rates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#D00800","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1930,"content":"<p>My understanding is that it is in the form of grant aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1931,"content":"<p>It would be investment in the port itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#D01000","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1932,"content":"<p>Yes.

The NTA has a wide range of specific functions relating to public transport, which may be summarised as: strategic planning of transport in the greater Dublin area; infrastructure development, including developing an integrated public transport network, and providing bus fleets, and cycling facilities; regulatory functions, including the licensing of taxis and hackneys, and the licensing of commercial bus passenger services; procuring subsidised public transport services; managing the rural transport programme; promoting public transport, including integrated ticketing, fares, and information; and various other related functions.  It is a wide-ranging remit, and touches on almost everyone's life in one way or another.<\/p> <p>  My own background includes a decade as CEO of the National Roads Authority so that I come to this position with a reasonable knowledge of the transportation arena, and of the role of the NTA within the State structure.

At that time, there were significant sums being invested in the road infrastructure and one can see the benefits.  We are reaping the benefits of it.  Certainly, it is much easier to get around the country than it was in the past.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry is now looking to move into a new role.  In Mr. Barry's view, is it the National Transport Authority's role to devise or implement policy?  Often there is a tendency for State companies, such as Dublin Bus, CI&Eacute; or Irish Rail, to state that they are only implementing the role of the National Transport Authority and sometimes political personnel can deflect matters to the National Transport Authority.  My belief is that it is the job of the Members of the D&aacute;il to bring forward policy and it is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority to implement that policy.  I would welcome Mr. Barry's opinion on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry quite rightly identified that transport faces many challenges, not least the challenge of how to ensure that we have a proper integrated public transport network that will be environmentally friendly, energy efficient, affordable and reliable.  I ask Mr. Barry's opinion in that regard, as every Government, be it this one or the next one, will have a limited pot of funding.  How does Mr. Barry envisage being able to meet the challenges of public transport from a financial perspective?  When he was CEO of the NRA, Mr. Barry used, one might say, quite rightly, public private partnerships to the maximum benefit.  Can public private partnerships be used to a greater extent to fund the much needed investment in infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barry cited strategy planning.  One of the big issues we face now is homelessness, the lack of affordable housing and sustainable development in the housing sector.  Transport has a pivotal role to play in addressing these challenges and I would welcome Mr. Barry's opinion on that.<\/p> <p>  Cycling is not often mentioned but anyone who commutes in and out of Dublin city sees the significant increase in the number who have taken up cycling as their preferred mode of transport.  Less than 1% of the overall national budget is attributable to cycling.  Is that right?  Is it sustainable?<\/p> <p>  I will have to go to ask a question but I will be back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#F00800","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1975,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Last night I raised with the Minister the issue that there are almost 93,000 households in rural Ireland that do not have access to rail, bus, hackney or taxi.  That is a hell of a lot of people who face near isolation.  What are Mr. Barry's plans to address that?<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to ask what percentage of the current bus fleet of coaches, in particular, the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet, has disability access, whether it be lifts, ramps, etc.  I attended a disability rights forum last weekend in Drogheda where it was highlighted that coaches do not have to be wheelchair accessible or do not have to comply with the regulation.  If that is the case, why is it still so?<\/p> <p>  Another issue raised was that the disability access standards on the Enterprise trains are far more up to scratch.<\/p><p>There seems to be a lot more thought put into turning room and the layout, in that when a person in a wheelchair boards the train it is easier for them to manoeuvre and position themselves, in comparison with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann trains.  Has the National Transport Authority examined the Enterprise trains and how they model their disability access? This comes from users and their experiences.  Has the NTA done this comparison and if not, why has it not done so and will it happen? I am sure Mr. Barry realises there are problems in this regard.<\/p><p> I also want to ask Mr. Barry about the plans for the further privatisation of bus and rail services.  I am sure he will say it is not privatisation and that it is outsourcing.  There is not a whole lot of difference between the two.  What are the plans, outside of the 10% of bus routes?  There is also a lot of disquiet around the Go-Ahead contracts and the fact that given it is using taxpayers money, the public and public representatives cannot have access to the contract.  There is concern around decisions for awarding the contract.  According to reports, the Bus &Eacute;ireann tender came in cheaper than the Go-Ahead bid.  I believe there are also various reports regarding the Go-Ahead delivery of services.  These are conflicting reports but from what we hear they are not all 100%.  When will we get sight of the reasons, the costs of awarding the contract to Go-Ahead and why the decision was made to award the contract to Go-Ahead as opposed to our national fleet in Bus &Eacute;ireann?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#F01000","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1978,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Troy's questions first about who sets the policy.  It is the Oireachtas and the Minister who set strategic policy.  An organisation such as the NTA would certainly have a policy setting role, but that would be subsidiary to the policy set by the Government or the Minister.  I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the NTA should be trying to develop or implement policies that run counter to the policies of the Government.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the issue of public transport and the affordability of investment in the role of public private partnerships, PPPs.  As the Chairman is aware, I have had considerable involvement with PPPs in my time with the National Roads Authority.  PPPs generally worked well in those circumstances because they allowed us to build roads that otherwise would not have been built.  The point is well made that it is cheaper for the State to borrow as the State, than it is for any subsidiary State agency to generate or borrow money through a PPP offering.  There is sometimes a question in this regard.  If, because of the constraints on a government's fiscal space or EU rules and so on, one cannot borrow the money through national borrowing, then one is looking at whether money could be borrowed effectively through a PPP.  In those circumstances, the need for the investment and the return on it would have to be significantly greater than the cost through the PPP.  If State funding is available it is lower cost funding to the public than PPP funding.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the role of transport on housing, I believe the NTA has a particular role.  The NTA is responsible for the integration of transport and land use, planning with all the local authorities and the strategic transport planning in the Dublin area.  In regard to local authority county or area plans into which the NTA has an input, when the local authority is planning where the housing is to go and how it is to be developed, it is important this is done in conjunction with the NTA so that development of the transport and the housing goes hand in glove and when the housing is developed that there is transport for the people.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy made reference to the increasing numbers of people who cycle.  I include myself in that increase.  I do not know all the details of the NTA's cycling development plans.  I do, however, know they are looking at developing some 200 km of cycle ways in the greater Dublin area.  If this is done it will be a significant help in developing cycling.  Cycling facilities, especially within urban areas, are at a much lower standard than we would all like them to be.  The mingling of heavy traffic and cycling in particular is inherently dangerous.  We would all like to see an evolution of segregated cycling lanes with time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1979,"content":"<p>That would be safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1980,"content":"<p>Deputy Munster asked a number of detailed questions.  Because I am not actually in the job yet I do not have detailed answers for her on those issues.  Where I do not have a detailed response I will get back to the Deputy on it.  I shall comment generally on her questions.  Providing disability access in public transport is absolutely essential.  If there are areas where there is a better disability service provided - such as on the Enterprise  - than on other trains then we should certainly examine what can be done to move to the higher standard on those trains.<\/p> <p>  I am surprised to hear there are coaches being licensed that do not have to comply with the regulations.  Because it is news to me I cannot give Deputy Munster a response on that.  I expect that, if we are not at the point where all coaches are required to comply with disability access, we are moving in that direction.  I would expect that to be the case.<\/p> <p>  Whether or not a service is to be privatised is a matter for government policy rather than NTA policy.  That is a strategic policy position.  I am not aware of any.  In the interviews I went through, before arriving at this position, nobody raised the question of privatisation with me.  That matter is for the Government.  I have no particular agenda in that area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to outsourcing, I believe that competition is very healthy.  I spent most of my working life in the private sector, competing for work.  That made us more efficient and better at the job.  Not everything is suitable for outsourcing but when it is done in the right place I believe it is okay.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked also about plans to go outside the 10% level of outsourcing.  I am not aware of the plans but again because I am coming in to the job there may be plans about which I am not familiar.  As we sit here at the moment I am not aware of anything beyond that.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that Go-Ahead was awarded the contract for 10% of the bus routes but I do not know the details of the Go-Ahead contract.  I do not have the details of past contracts awarded by the NTA.  I assume that Go-Ahead won because it met the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criteria.  I believe we are all aware that under the EU rules for public tenders, the most economically advantageous tender has to govern.  Deputy Munster asked why it was Go-Ahead rather than the national carrier.  When it is a competitive situation, no matter how much one might want to give it to one party or a national carrier, under the current procurement laws that is not allowed.  That is the law as we have it.  This does not give the Deputy any details on the contract, but I do not have any details on the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1510752600,"counter":1981,"content":"<p>I would like a written response to all of the questions I have asked, including the disability access issue compared to the Enterprise service, the access to coaches, the reasons the contract was given to Go-Ahead above Bus &Eacute;ireann and if we cannot see details of the contract, why not?

They also look at his CV and see that Mr. Barry was involved in &euro;3 billion of private investment in roads through public private partnerships.  We have a very particular situation in Bus &Eacute;ireann at the moment and I am going to concentrate in my comments on that.  We have a ballot for strike action if the company tries to implement unilateral changes to rosters from next Sunday.  This is an immediate situation.  I said I would try to be the voice of bus workers and I make no apology for reading a few quotes from bus workers as reported by <i>thejournal.ie <\/i>on the current situation with rosters.  The first is from a bus worker:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Look, this is all coming from the NTA (National Transport Association),&quot; one source said.  &quot;They contact Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, etc, and say that Behaviour and Attitudes surveys say we need more services.  So you get the NX (Navan Expressway, launched on 19 September) launched to great fanfare.  They tell us to provide it.  But the company hasn't sat down to see whether or not we actually can provide it.  Do we have the buses?  Do we have the drivers?  The answer is no we don't, and it's knocked the whole applecart in the region.<\/blockquote> <p>The second excerpt is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Lads are doing 12-14 hour shifts and then being told to walk back to the depot.  Fellas are starting to walk out on the job.  There's no work life balance now,&quot; says one driver.  &quot;The company says it wants efficiency,&quot; says another.  &quot;Well, so do we.  But it&rsquo;s all very well aiming for 84% efficiency in driving.  That leaves no room for efficiency in family life.  There's no work\/life balance.  What are the younger drivers with families supposed to do?&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>The last excerpt from the article is a short one:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;At any one time Broadstone is short 100 buses per day,&quot; one source says.  &quot;And on a day towards the end of October there were 45 private operators in use.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>The general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union, Mr. Dermot O'Leary, has said these are oppressive and unworkable conditions.  I put it to Mr. Barry that what the NTA has done is set Bus &Eacute;ireann up to fail.  There have been 120 redundancies and trying to organise rosters for new routes, such as the Navan one, means that either the workers are crucified or private operators are brought in or, as is being done now, a bit of both.  The unions and the workers, who are the people who drive the buses every day and know more about the running of a bus company than anyone in the management, in my opinion, have put forward alternative suggestions on the way rosters might be organised.  Alternative suggestion after alternative suggestion has been shot down and we are now on the verge of a dispute.  I put it to Mr. Barry that it looks very much as though the situation has been set up to fail.  Is this an attempt to bring Bus &Eacute;ireann into disrepute in the eyes of the public and to further a privatisation agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017111500002#H00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510752600,"counter":1988,"content":"<p>I cannot make any comment on the detail of much of what Deputy Barry has just said.

The NTA has sought and will probably continue to seek outsourcing and competition.

I welcome Mr. Barry and the opportunity to engage with him.  My interest as a Senator, first thing in the morning and last thing at night, is the inclusion of people with disabilities.  That is the mandate I sought and, thankfully, the mandate I got.  We have a public sector duty on foot of equality legislation to provide public services for all of the public.  Ireland has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it is intended to ratify that.  It copperfastens the public sector duty towards people with disabilities.  The convention contains articles on free and easy access to public transport in all its different domains and modalities.  That is where I am coming from.<\/p> <p>   Like other Members of the Oireachtas, I receive contact regarding, and am very much aware from my work of, issues people with disabilities experience on a pretty constant basis, without over-egging it, of failing to access public transport, whether it is taxis, city bus services, regional bus services and trains.  Buses in particular are an issue, including the national bus fleet, Dublin Bus and contracted services.  The first and foremost obligation of the chairman of the NTA is around the governance of the organisation.  I am clearly stating that part of that governance and its linchpin is that it is a public service for all of the public.  It is a stretch to provide that but it is a commitment we have made and, in any event, it is what public services are supposed to be about.  I am concerned that places outside Dublin - beyond the Pale, to use that old term - do not get a fair shake when it comes to public transport.  There is the issue of the quantum of it but there is also a requirement for the NTA to ensure that it is even handed when making decisions to improve services for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  A young woman of 20, who is a wheelchair user, has come to me.  She went through all her schooling and has been supported to go to college.  In fairness, the State has put a decent investment into her education.  The fly in the ointment for her is that 20 times in 2017 alone, having booked and given advance notice, she was let down either on the outward journey or on the way back.  She cannot put her hand on her heart and say to a prospective employer or place where she is doing a project that she will be there for an interview.  Mr. Barry knows exactly what I am saying.  My point is that public transport is not an either-or thing.  It stands between that young woman and the possibility of a future.  She either goes one way or back the other way.  I am not trying to nag, but it is a critical issue for people.  I have given just one example but there are many others.  That is why I am passionate and strong about this.<\/p><p>During the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike earlier this year, Bus &Eacute;ireann took services off three routes.

There were sufficient seats to put bums on but all the Bus &Eacute;ireann buses that were taken off the route were wheelchair accessible and none of the remaining buses was accessible nor were any required, under the licence, to be accessible.  Whether the provider is public or private, it is unacceptable, if it is a public service, for the person with a disability who wants to go from A to B to have to worry who the provider is.  It should be equally accessible if it is a public service.<\/p> <p>  That still leaves us shy of the issue of whether those accessible buses would be available as accessible stock on the day of the outward or return journey, which brings us to this issue of the notice period.  We can change our minds.  Someone could get a phone call tonight that a relative is not well or such, say that there is a bus at a certain time in the morning and that he or she will get it.  A disabled person, using a wheelchair, cannot do that but has to wait two days with crossed fingers.  That is a huge issue as is the one of people who are blind or deaf being able to have advance notice of where they are on the journey and what the next stop is.  The whole service is patchy in that regard and is not up to the mark.  There is a range of issues.  I could go on.
