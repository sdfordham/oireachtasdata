It is another year of double-digit rental increases.  Over the past number of years, the increase in Dublin has been quite shocking and is having a huge impact on people.  In Dublin, rents have gone up 81% since 2010.  Outside of Dublin, that figure is 52% but that includes Meath, where they have gone up 81% and Louth, where they have gone up by about 78% in that seven or eight years.  Cork, Galway and Limerick are up 65%.  Alarmingly, only about 3,150 properties are available to rent now, which is 20% down on the number available this time last year.<\/p><p>Behind all these figures there are human stories.  Many families are under threat of eviction and are extremely worried, having been given deadlines by landlords to leave their properties because they need to renovate them or give them to family members.  Many families are now doubling and tripling up, as we know from our clinics.  There are people coming in who are living with their parents or siblings and so on.  There are young people getting their first jobs in cities and 40% to 50% of their income is going on rent.  The student experience is becoming hazardous.  It is almost impossible for students going to cities to attend universities and institutes of technologies to get any place to rent at a reasonable cost.  By any yardstick, for many families across the country, it is now the dominant measure of the cost of third level education.<\/p><p>Above all, it has an impact on homelessness.  There are 9,000 people in emergency accommodation, including 3,000 children.  Without doubt, the worsening situation in regard to rents is accelerating and making the homeless situation even more perilous.<\/p><p>All the initiatives undertaken under the various plans have failed.  The rent pressure zones introduced in 2016 are ineffective in stemming the rent increases.  Housing supply measures are very poor.  Housing targets set by Government have not been met.<\/p> <p> A report on the tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation, published by the Department of Finance in September 2017, made ten recommendations, short, medium and long-term.  It is extraordinary that not one of those recommendations has been implemented by Government.  There were approximately 212,000 landlords in 2012, whereas now there are only 175,000.  There is a problem there.  The Government received clear recommendations, yet it chose not to implement even one of them.

In terms of the substantive issue, everyone in this House, and certainly the Government, is very aware of the impact that rising rents are having on many people.  In some cases they risk driving people into homelessness.  In many cases people are required to pay a huge portion of their post-tax incomes in rent, thus leaving very little money for other costs, whether child care or the many other costs of living.  We acknowledge absolutely that rising rents are having an enormous impact on people, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet.<\/p><p>That is exactly why we introduced the rent pressure zones.  Let us not forget what they do.  They now cover more than half of people who are tenants and those people now have their rent increases capped at 4% or less.  They are not covered in the statistics published today by <i>daft.ie<\/i>because, as it acknowledges, they cover only new properties and new tenancies.  Most people who are renting have been protected by the rent pressure zones and face rent increases of less than 4% as a result of actions taken by this Government and Oireachtas.  Those whose rent has not gone up, or has gone up by less than 4%, will be very glad that is in place.<\/p><p>The <i>daft.ie<\/i>figures do not cover people covered by the 4% cap in the rent pressure zones, people already in properties.  They refer to new tenancies and properties and it is a relatively small sample.  There will be a bigger sample from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, when its numbers come out.  They will cover rents paid as opposed to the asking rent.<\/p><p>The Government is doing many things but there are some major things.  One is enhancing the powers of the RTB, turning it into a real regulator with more enforcement powers.  Another is taking measures to encourage landlords, and it is important that we encourage them to stay in the private rental sector and that more come into it.  That is being done by measures such as restoring mortgage interest relief which had been reduced to 75% during the economic crisis and has been increased towards between 80% and 85% in recent times.<\/p><p>We are getting building again.  It is very important that we build again.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is working on new guidelines, especially on apartment building to make it more economic to build apartments in our cities where housing is most needed.  The Deputy mentioned student accommodation and there has been an explosion in the amount of student accommodation in recent years.  It is being built and provided throughout the country and that will have an impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300004#B00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1518530700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Taoiseach lives in the real world because if he talks to any student or family he will learn that rents have gone through the roof.

In terms of substance and actions, I have already mentioned some of them.  First, we have introduced rent pressure zones.  Most people who rent are covered by a rent pressure zone and have seen their rent increase by 4% or less.  As they are not covered by the <i>daft.ie<\/i>figures, most are facing rent increases of less than 4% because of actions taken by the Government.  We are enhancing the powers and remit of the Residential Tenancies Board to give it the power to be a proper rent regulator and we are also building.  The Deputy can see the amount of student accommodation being built around the city in the past couple of years.  He can see that house building is being ramped up in the private sector.  We added 7,000 units to the social housing stock last year, which was very significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300005#C00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On 5 December 2017 the Taoiseach told the House that rent pressure zones were working and that 60% of renters had had the assurance that their rent could not rise by more than 4% per year.  He also made the astonishing claim that rent pressure zones had never been designed to cover new tenancies and that they did not apply to them.  The latest <i>daft.ie<\/i>rent report was published this morning.  It confirms that in the 12 months since the rent pressure zones were introduced, rents have increased by 10%.  This is the seventh report which indicates increases in rent which has been published since the pressure zones were introduced.  All four <i>daft.ie<\/i>reports show rent increases above the 4% cap, but, crucially, the three ESRI Residential Tenancies Board reports which include existing tenancies show rent increases above the 4% cap in each of the three quarters.  Therefore, on average it now costs in excess of &euro;20,000 per year to rent in Dublin, while on average it costs at least &euro;10,000 per year to rent outside Dublin.  Rents have increased by 65% since 2011 and are now 19% higher than at the peak of the boom in the Celtic tiger period.  How are ordinary people meant to afford this level of rent?  They include young working people, young couples, students or later in life couples.  Does the Taoiseach really believe they can afford such excessive rents?  Have their incomes increased by 65% since 2011?  Perhaps he might think they should ask their parents for the extra rent.<\/p><p>The rent pressure zones are not working.  That is what the figures in all seven reports tell the Taoiseach.  They have created a two-tier rental market.  Long-term secure tenants have some protection, but those in vulnerable or new tenancies have no protection.  The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report confirms that breaches of the 4% cap are widespread in the case of new tenancies.  There is also a growing number of landlords who are charging existing tenants illegal under-the-counter payments above the 4% cap.  Landlords outside the rent pressure zones in Waterford, Limerick and parts of Cork are actively encouraged to jack up rents to unsustainable levels within the rent pressure zones.  Worst of all, the Taoiseach expects vulnerable tenants to police the system.  <\/p><p>What has the Taoiseach got against renters?  Is he blind to the plight of tenants because so many members of his parliamentary party are landlords?  Is it because the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has been captured by large-scale institutional investors or vulture funds or is it because the Taoiseach is so out of touch that he just does not understand how working people are able to keep a roof over their heads?<\/p><p>My questions are very simple.  Will the Government now accept on the basis of evidence that rent pressure zones are failing?  Will it move to introduce real rent certainty, linking rents to an index, such as the consumer price index, to give struggling renters a break?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300005#C00900","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I assume most of those questions were rhetorical and therefore do not require an answer.

The majority of people who now rent in Ireland are covered by the rent-pressure zones and are seeing rent increases of 4% or less.  There are, of course, exceptions to that, for example, in the case of substantial refurbishment and other things.  The difficulty that arises is that for new tenancies and new properties, rents are continuing to rise at double-digit rates.<\/p><p>Therefore, what is the solution?  The solution is to ensure there is more supply in the rented sector.  Today's report from <i>daft.ie<\/i>shows that only about 3,000 new properties are available for rent.  The solution, therefore, must lie in ensuring we have an increase in supply, which is what we are doing.  The Deputy can see the amount of student accommodation that has been built around the country in recent years and there is more to come.  He can see the ramp-up in the building of social housing by government with 7,000 houses and homes added to the social housing stock last year, trebling the number of direct builds by local authorities.  He can see an increase in private sector builds with approximately 17,000 new homes built last year.  In addition, we are strengthening the powers of the Residential Tenancy Board to turn it into a proper regulator with more enforcement powers so that people are not expected to enforce these rules for themselves.<\/p><p>We need to be careful with any additional measures.  I have heard what Dr. Lyons has had to say and what people from the Irish Property Owners Association and others have had to say.  There is a risk that introducing rent controls that are too strict or too rigid could be counterproductive and could actually create even more of a black market in rent.  We have seen that happening in places with very strict rent controls where people end up paying cash amounts under the table or subletting to others.  We need to ensure we do not make those kinds of mistakes.  We also need to ensure we do not do anything that discourages people from staying in, or coming into, the private rented sector.  Landlords get a very bad press.  While some of them deserve it, they do not all deserve it.  We need to ensure we reverse the decline in the number of people who are renting out properties and measures can be taken in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300006#D00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I know the Taoiseach has difficulty with counting when it comes to housing.

In quarter one of last year, they increased by 7%; in quarter two of last year they increased by 6%; and in quarter three of last year they increased by 9%.  The data on all tenancies indicate that the 4% cap simply for the tenants covered by it, simply does not work.<\/p><p>It is not that we want rent controls that are too stringent; we would just like some that work.

Unfortunately these 84 welcome new homes we spoke of on that happy occasion will not be delivered until quarter 2 of 2019.  Probably like the Taoiseach and many other Deputies, I meet dozens of citizens and families every weekend who are in great anxiety and distress over the Government's continuing failure to deliver social and affordable housing.  I meet constituents who have spent 12, 14, 16 and even up to 20 years on housing and transfer lists and some of these are facing eviction from rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and rent supplement supported tenancies, sometimes on foot of a court order.  Other desperate families are approaching two years or more in emergency homeless accommodation.  It is also very depressing that homeless families with young children are still being allocated hotel-type accommodation, eight months after the T&aacute;naiste promised me that that practice would cease.  Recently, I came across two young people who were living in a car during the current dreadfully cold weather.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bay North, as the Taoiseach may know, comprises the largest Dublin City Council housing area, area B, and the southern part of the Howth-Malahide housing area of Fingal county.  The social housing statistics prepared by our city and county managers, Mr. Owen Keegan and Mr. Paul Reid, confirm the sense of hopelessness felt by my constituents in dire need of housing.  On the last Dublin city waiting lists and allocations report, there were an astonishing 7,114 families and individuals on homeless, housing and transfer lists in area B out of 27,000 citywide.  In the 2017 Housing Agency Rebuilding Ireland report, even before the numbers of households on the Howth-Malahide list are added to the city total, Dublin Bay North had the highest housing waiting list in Ireland, even bigger than the whole of Fingal and South Dublin.  It is much more shocking that almost 700 of these individuals and families are homeless and nearly 900 have been waiting for more than ten years with a further almost 2,500 waiting more than five years.  This is not just a problem for Dublin Bay North, as we have heard again today.<\/p>  <p>  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and national and local housing officials but the above data clearly show that Rebuilding Ireland is not working for our constituents.  Over the past decade, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have done everything possible to support a dysfunctional, rigged property market.  At the same time, it was the Taoiseach's Government and Fianna F&aacute;il which cut Dublin and local authorities' staff by 20% to 35% since 2008.  Is it not time to abandon the ideological posturing and commit to a massive emergency programme of public, social and affordable housing as advocated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its Charter for Housing Rights?  Besides the declaration of a national housing and homelessness emergency, that charter demands a referendum to put the right to housing into the Constitution, robust legislation on tenants' rights, rents and standards of accommodation, a ban on evictions of citizens, families and children into homelessness and a land management policy based on the Kenny report and necessary compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  These demands are echoed by the Campaign for Public Housing which I also support.  As part of this programme, will the Taoiseach now establish a national social and affordable housing development and construction company, even initially in the Dublin and other urban regions?  I know the Taoiseach was discussing an amendment of the National Asset Management Agency legislation to permit NAMA to have this function.  That seems impossible but we need a national effort because these figures are disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300007#E00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I do not think anyone in this House doubts the scale of the challenge we face with regard to housing and homelessness.

The number of families living in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels is down from the peak.  In the last month for which we have records, the number of families in emergency accommodation is down, but that may well just be a seasonal blip and I would not read too much into it at this stage.  It indicates some progress in some areas.<\/p>  <p>  We should not forget where we are coming from with regard to the crisis we face with housing.  We had a seven-year period after a severe economic crisis during which very few homes were built at all.  The banks were bust, the construction industry collapsed and the Government was not in a position to build new housing because of the fiscal crisis.  In that period, however, the population continued to grow and many new households were formed.  We are now playing catch-up and we are catching up.  The amount of social housing built by local authorities is being ramped up.  There were only 657 direct builds in 2016 and there were 2,045 last year.<\/p><p>The number of social homes built directly by the councils and approved housing bodies has trebled and we are also seeing an increased uptake in construction in the private housing sector.

The statistics in the reports we received recently show that only 322 direct build homes were delivered by Dublin City Council across the city of Dublin in the period 2015 to 2017 and that only seven homes were built by Fingal County Council in the period 2010 to 2015 and only 76 in 2016-17.  There are well over 7,000 applicants on the housing list in Fingal County Council, as well as over 400 homeless families.  It is no wonder that the European Commission, in its latest post-programme surveillance report, has severely criticised the Government's flimsy and lethargic housing policies.  The Commission highlights the almost 20% increase in rents since the crash-era peaks and the pathetic trickle of social and affordable housing.

It is a multiannual plan to be funded in a five to six-year timeframe.  The nature of a five or ten-year plan is such that it will not work after five or six months or one year.  The Deputy asked why does the Government not just get building.  That is exactly what we are doing.  The number of direct builds by local authorities and approved housing bodies increased from 650 in 2016 to 2,245 last year and that number will increase again this year.  The number of voids brought back into use last year was 1,757.  The number of houses acquired by local authorities last year was 2,266, an increase on the less than 2,000 acquired the previous year.  It sometimes makes sense for local authorities to acquire houses rather than build them because it is quicker and helps to develop more integrated communities.  In addition, another 798 houses were delivered through leasing arrangements.  Through different mechanisms over 7,000 homes were added to the social housing stock last year, which made a real difference.  It should not be forgotten that every working day the Government, through local authorities and approved housing bodies, houses 100 individuals and families.

These are hospitals which do not provide emergency services.  Model 2 hospitals resulted from the reconfiguration of the hospital system several years ago into centres of excellence as proclaimed by then Minister for Health, former Deputy Mary Harney, thus taking acute services away from many county and regional hospitals.  In return, the model 2 hospitals were to be developed to provide services such as acute medical assessment units, day care services and outpatient services and act as diagnostic centres to include scans in order that patients would access services close to their homes and within their own regions.  Model 2 hospitals, therefore, were to provide services that would be complementary to those provided in the regional hospitals and relieve footfall in them, particularly in emergency departments.<\/p><p>The development of hospital groups was to drive this development forward.  Model 2 hospitals are being starved of funding, finances and staff, and they are not being supported by both lay and medical management within the hospital groups.<\/p> <p> Ennis General Hospital is the only hospital in the Mid West Hospital Group that provides a medical assessment unit service seven days per week, yet the management of the group is proposing to close the unit and reduce the seven-day service to a five-day service.  This has much more to do with medical politics than the delivery of care to patients.  Effectively, it is a failure of the group to deploy resources properly.  Considering that the Mid Western Hospital Group is unable to open its own medical assessment unit on weekdays, not to mind weekends, it defies logic that it would now propose to close the only seven-day medical assessment unit within the region, namely, that in Ennis.  This will curtail services within the hospital in Ennis but it will also transfer considerable pressure to the accident and emergency services in Limerick because the patients who would occupy the medical assessment unit beds will now end up in the regional hospital in Limerick.  Medical assessment units are part of the integration of the primary and secondary care elements of our health service, and discontinuing them will break that continuity.<\/p> <p> Sl&aacute;intecare addresses these issues and provides solutions.  It demands that there be accountability and responsibility for decisions.  Decisions should be made not for medical or political reasons but for patient care.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the existing services in Ennis will be maintained on a seven-day basis and that all model 2 hospitals will be expanded to provide medical assessment facilities on a seven-day basis nationally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300008#F00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518533100,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It is not quite correct to say model 2 hospitals are being starved of funding.

Therefore, the Deputy's statement is probably incorrect.  I would imagine that the Minister, Deputy Harris, can provide the numbers to back me up.<\/p>  <p>  I have never been fully comfortable with the idea of crudely dividing hospitals into model 3 and model 2 categories because different hospitals have different roles in different places.  The hospital in Roscommon may have a very different role from the hospitals in Ennis or Nenagh, although they are all model 2 hospitals.  Roscommon hospital, as the Deputy knows, has never been busier.  It has seen major additions to its functions and patient numbers in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the whole point of establishing hospital groups was to give hospital groups autonomy and give them decision-making power regarding how best to deploy resources in their regions between the community and the hospitals, and among the hospitals.

The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has been pursuing this since he entered government.  Unfortunately, he has not been successful so far.<\/p>  <p>  Medical assessment units and model 2 hospitals are critical to health care delivery.  Not only do they deliver medical assessment services but they also deliver day care, theatre services and diagnostic services.  In Ennis, the theatre is idle for in excess of 50% of the time it is manned.  The CT scanner there is operated for three hours per day on a five-day week basis.  Therefore, it is operated for 15 hours per week.  It does not work at weekends.  This is a complete waste of resources.

Model 2 hospitals and hospitals that do not have emergency departments can play a very effective role in providing for elective surgery and day cases, access to diagnostics and giving GPs direct access to these hospitals through medical assessment units.  The fact that they do not have emergency departments means that they can plan care much better because they do not have to deal with the unpredictability as to whether 30 or 40 patients will need to be admitted from the emergency department on a given day.  They can plan their work much more than hospitals that have emergency departments.  Ultimately, decisions on resource allocations should not be directed by my office or the Minister.

In that case, the landlord has clearly broken the law, but in order for the tenant to get a hearing at the WRC, he or she has to wait at least eight months.  Availing of the Residential Tenancies Board offers two options to the tenant.  One is telephone mediation which can take about four weeks and with which the landlord is under no obligation to comply.

According to a report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the affected websites include those of the HSE, the Oireachtas, <i>safe<\/i>food and some local authorities.  According to the report, cyberattacks have become increasingly common in recent times, particularly on Government websites and IT networks.  What action has been taken by the National Cyber Security Centre in response to the latest attacks?  We have to accept that it is not just a domestic issue; it is also one that needs an international response.  The EU directive on network and information systems is supposed to represent a significant change in how countries in Europe approach cybersecurity and is due to be transposed into Irish law before 9 May.  Will that deadline be met?<\/p><p>In recent days the European Committee of Social Rights upheld the right of representative associations of the Defence Forces to better collective bargaining negotiating rights and affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Government has repeatedly blocked this on the grounds of so-called national security.  Yesterday the president of PDFORRA said &quot;the Government fought us every step of the way in respect of this complaint.&quot;  Is it not the right time to do the right thing and provide proper employee rights for members of the Defence Forces to allow for collective bargaining and affiliation to the ICTU?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300017#P02200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1518537300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the point made by Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin on the cyberattack by rogue hackers which infected a number of State agency systems, apparently mining for cryptocurrencies.  I do not know how it is done, but I am sure somebody does.  The impact is simply the latest manifestation of the vulnerability of State's Internet systems to external attack.  Obviously, the data held by organisations such as the HSE, the Oireachtas and local authorities can be very important for citizens.  What efforts are under way specifically to deal with the most significant potential assaults on us as a nation?  I understand the Defence Forces have only two personnel seconded to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to deal with this issue on an ongoing basis.  Will the Taoiseach give us an indication of the structure and size of the efforts made to combat cyberattacks and maintain cybersecurity in the State?  Does he believe it is enough?  Do we need a new agency?  Are the agencies in existence co-operating well?  How could matters be improved and have they been debated?<\/p>  <p>  I have two other brief questions.  One concerns foreign interference with our electoral processes.  We are aware from what happened overtly in the United States, France and a number of other countries that it is expected that external forces often try to influence the outcome of democratic elections by manipulating opinion online.  Do we have any defence mechanism against this or is it something that is on the Government's agenda?<\/p>  <p>  My third question is on a point I raised some time ago.  The Taoiseach might have had an opportunity to reflect on it.  If not, he might come back to me on it.  In the event of a national crisis, we issue a red alert.  We did it in the case of Storm Ophelia and there was a lot of confusion about what exactly it meant.  The Government task force on emergency planning was to have submitted a document in January for consideration by the Government.  That is what we were told at the end of last year about a national standard response that was expected when a red alert was declared.<\/p><p>Was that report submitted to the Government in January and will the Government issue national guidelines on how to handle a red alert?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300017#P02300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518537900,"counter":171,"content":"<p>On 22 May last year, the Taoiseach's predecessor said that the date and any element of the national security meetings should be kept confidential.  The Taoiseach has obviously changed this approach by tweeting the date and attendance of a meeting.  What is the current position on the public status of the committee?  Has the Government moved to a system where the dates and rotating attendance, as opposed to the fixed membership, will be public?  On several occasions the Taoiseach has said he wants to take time to examine what has been undertaken to neutralise cyberattacks which have been identified in the national risk as a threat of the highest level.  Has there been any progress on this measure?  Have any new steps been taken to join with groupings of European countries working together to identify and fend off cyberattacks?<\/p>  <p>  The Government recently opposed a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy Lawless which dealt with addressing the threat to democratic debate posed by illegally funded disinformation campaigns using social media.  This makes Ireland an outlier in Europe in saying that it is not interested in taking legislative action to protect its basic electoral financing and transparency laws.

The director of the National Cyber Security Centre attended the Cabinet subcommittee meeting last week and gave us a presentation on the work of that centre, what is being done and what more needs to be done.  Deputies will understand why I cannot disclose what is being done and what more needs to be done.  It is a relatively new centre, based in University College Dublin, UCD, and has approximately 20 members of staff.  It is fair to say there are real risks to information and data held by public bodies such as the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection when it comes to cybersecurity and cyberattacks.  We saw the impact of the WannaCry attack on the National Health Service, NHS, which thankfully we avoided in Ireland.  Given the many technology companies and data centres based in Ireland, we do have a particular responsibility to enhance and increase our actions in this area.<\/p>  <p>  On the cyberattacks, over recent years, having identified cybersecurity as an issue of national importance, we have steadily been building our cybersecurity capacity to ensure the State is protected against threats of security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of the network and information systems of critical national infrastructure operators and providers.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment published a national cybersecurity strategy 2015-17.  That formally established the National Cyber Security Centre, which is now up and running.  It is focused on the protection of critical national information infrastructure in sectors such as energy, health care, financial services, transport, drinking water supply, digital infrastructure and communications.  Recent cybersecurity incidents that have occurred globally were responded to and contained in Ireland but there was no cause for complacency.  By comparison with other jurisdictions the impact in Ireland has been limited.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in transposing the EU directive on the security of network and information systems.  That includes measures such as establishing a list of potential operators of essential services, OES, and the Department has published a consultation paper on the proposed security measures and incident reporting guidelines that these entities, once formally designated, will have to meet.  It will be on them and their obligation to provide such security but we will oversee it.  Work is progressing on the second area of legislation regarding the transposition of the directive and that will be finalised in quarter 1 of this year.  The current threat assessment for Ireland continues to be moderate.  That is, an attack is considered possible but not likely.<\/p>  <p>  The European Committee on Social Rights has considered a complaint submitted in 2014 by the European Organisation of Military Associations, EUROMIL, on behalf of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, concerning the lack of certain rights for military representative associations in Ireland.  Having considered the submissions made in 2015 and early 2016, the committee published its findings yesterday.  The committee concluded that prohibiting military personnel from the right to strike was not a breach of the European Social Charter but that the charter was breached in prohibiting the representative associations from affiliating with the national employee organisations such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and in respect of the right to bargain collectively.  The Government acknowledges the committee's findings and specifically the conclusion that the prohibition on the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces is not a violation of the European Social Charter.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military law, which is critically important for security and for the Defence Forces so that they are not restricted in undertaking their operations.<\/p>  <p>  Since the submissions which were the basis for the decision were made, the Government has taken steps to begin to deal with these issues.  The representative associations were invited to make submissions to the Public Service Pay Commission and were involved in the most recent pay negotiations that led to the Lansdowne Road agreement or its latest iteration.  The Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, has commenced a review of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme.  That is being chaired by Mr. Gerard Barry and PDFORRA is participating in that.  At the Minister of State's direction, the terms of reference require that the review now consider the committee's findings from yesterday.  This is the appropriate forum in which to consider the issues that arise from the committee's decision.  The Minister of State has also recently announced a review of the schemes and an initial meeting with the parties to the scheme will take place on 26 February 2018.  The committee's findings will be considered as part of that approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1518537900,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00400"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":174,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[5522\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his engagement with the Prime Minister of Estonia, Mr J&uuml;ri Ratas on 31 January 2018.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":175,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[5692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his planned meetings with foreign Heads of State over the next two months.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":176,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[5977\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent meeting with the Prime Minister of Estonia in Dublin; and the issues discussed at the meeting.","asker":"1360","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":177,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[6882\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Estonian Prime Minister on 31 January 2018.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":178,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[6905\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his travel plans over the next two months.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":179,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[7296\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the details of his forthcoming meetings with Heads of Government, Heads of State and EU Presidents over the next six months.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1518537900,"counter":180,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[7443\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300018#Q01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken to Chancellor Merkel since she has formed a government.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1518537900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, to 9, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I met the Estonian Prime Minister, Mr. J&uuml;ri Ratas, during his official visit to Ireland on 31 January.  This year marks the 100th anniversary of Estonian independence.  As a small EU member state approaching its own centenary, I congratulated the Prime Minister on Estonia's achievement and on the dynamic space it has created for itself in modern Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Estonia are like-minded on many issues, and we exchanged views on further intensifying our co-operation across the EU agenda.  This is particularly important in light of the debate on the future of Europe.  Our approaches are similar.  We both believe the EU needs an ambitious approach with a focus on implementing measures in areas that directly benefit our citizens' daily lives.  This means, for example, that we want to see completion of the Single Market, the digital Single Market, the capital markets union and the banking union.  We want to develop our trade relations with other parts of the world beyond the European Union. <\/p>  <p>  Estonia and Ireland have worked especially closely together on the digital agenda.  The Prime Minister and I agreed to continue our co-operation here, and we discussed some innovative new ideas, such as e-prescriptions.  We also, of course, discussed the Brexit negotiations.  I thanked Prime Minister Ratas for his support for our unique concerns, and highlighted the need to ensure that the commitments and principles agreed in December are translated into legal text in the withdrawal agreement, which is under negotiation.  We welcomed the negotiating directives on transitional arrangements that were agreed by foreign and Europe Ministers on 29 January, and looked forward to starting negotiations on these with the UK, as the EU 27.  We both agreed that the future relationship between the EU and the UK should be as close as possible while ensuring a level playing field and protecting the integrity of the Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  The Prime Minister and I discussed a range of other EU issues, including security and defence, where Estonia has some real concerns and where I noted our decision to participate in the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, as a founding member, and the EU budget, where we agreed on the need to ensure continued funding for agriculture and cohesion and to be open to looking at funding other new areas.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with our EU and international partners is crucial to Ireland's interests, particularly as Brexit advances and as we seek to form alliances around a range of issues.  I travelled to Vienna on 8 February where I had a bilateral meeting with the new Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.  We discussed several issues of shared interest, including the forthcoming Austrian Presidency in the second half of this year.<\/p><p>I also had the opportunity to meet the Austrian President, the Foreign Minister and the European Affairs Minister.<\/p> <p> I have not yet had an opportunity to speak with Chancellor Merkel since the conclusion of government formation negotiations.  As the House is aware, Chancellor Merkel and I had a bilateral meeting last June and I look forward to meeting her in the near future once a new government is established in Germany.<\/p> <p> I have met and spoken with Prime Minister May on several occasions, including most recently yesterday in Belfast where we assessed the state of play in the negotiations to restore the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and encouraged the parties to reach an agreement so that functioning institutions can commence work again in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  We are hopeful that the two main parties will be able to come to agreement this week allowing other parties to join thereafter and establish an inclusive Executive for Northern Ireland.  We also discussed Brexit and I made clear that we want and expect to see the agreement reached in December fully reflected in the withdrawal agreement.  This means spelling out the regulatory alignment option in detail but does not preclude exploring the other options proposed by the UK Government in parallel.  This is option B.<\/p> <p> I will meet with President Mattarella of Italy tomorrow during his state visit to Ireland.  On 23 February, I will attend an informal summit of EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels as part of President Tusk's leaders' agenda.<\/p> <p> I also plan to visit the US for the traditional St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  This provides a unique opportunity for us to advance our interests with a country with which we have deep connections and many shared interests.  I look forward to the visit during which I will meet with President Trump in Washington DC.<\/p> <p> I will attend meetings of the European Council in Brussels on 22 and 23 March and on 28 and 29 June.  As usual, I will report to the House both before and after those meetings.  I also hope to attend an informal EU summit which has been scheduled to take place in Sofia in Bulgaria on 17 May.  Further bilateral engagements are being planned, including a visit to Dublin by the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel.

I support Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's point of order, which is well made.  Estonia is a country with a history not unlike our own.  It has endured centuries of occupation and, as the Taoiseach said, celebrates a very significant centenary this year, which is the anniversary of its declaration of independence.  We have a relatively small but very vibrant Estonian community in Ireland and I think we will all extend our solidarity to it on this significant milestone.  In more modern times, Estonia is very similar to this country in that it is a small northern European country with an open economy that is heavily reliant on IT and technology sectors.  In that respect, it has many of the same objectives as us in the context of Brexit.  It is important that we build new and strong alliances and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments in respect of that.  I know the Taoiseach has met with the Estonian Prime Minister as well as other Prime Ministers from northern Europe and that in advance of the European Council meeting in October, he participated in a meeting of the leaders of the Nordic-Baltic Eight group of states, which includes Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  At the time, the Taoiseach referred to states as like-minded so did he attend the same meeting in December and does he intend to do so in March?  Does he intend to join this group on a permanent basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300019#R01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1518538500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Pretty much every week that goes by, the US President, Donald Trump, provides us with further evidence of the threat he represents to the world, peace, the environment and whole swathes of the world's population.  I assume the Taoiseach will meet Donald Trump on St. Patrick's Day in the White House.  I would prefer if he did not and made it clear why he should not but I wonder whether he has any thoughts about what he will say to Donald Trump.  If we just take two recent instances, in the past few days, Donald Trump has indicated that any discussion about Jerusalem is off the table.  He is not even willing to discuss what the whole world recognises as a dangerous development, namely, the recognition by his Government of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with all the connotations and provocation that represents for the Middle East.  He does not even want to discuss it.  He is saying it is off the negotiating table.  Donald Trump has also simultaneously ramped up further aid to Israel.

The Taoiseach mentioned that in his reply.  The UK and Ireland have traditionally been in agreement about many of the big issues confronting the EU.  Brexit is a big concern for us and other EU states adjacent to the UK from the point of view of trade but it is not a big issue for many other EU states.  I note that the Taoiseach recently met with the Prime Minister of Estonia in Dublin and the Chancellor of Austria in Vienna.  Estonia is part of the Nordic-Baltic Eight while Austria is a neutral country.  Their support for the prevention of a hard border on this island is most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, all of this is against the backdrop of a wider discussion on the future of the EU.  The Taoiseach is gradually outlining his vision in that regard.  I have noted his comments on such matters as the need to safeguard cohesion funding, particularly for central and eastern Europe, having regard to the principle of subsidiarity; the future of the CAP; our low corporation tax regime; the completion of the Single Market; the digital Single Market; the capital markets union; and the banking union.  Immigration is, of course, is a big issue for Austria having regard to the composition of its new Government.  Security and defence are obviously big issues for the Baltic states given their proximity to Russia.  What were the main issues of concern to Estonia and Austria as outlined to the Taoiseach and what assurances did he give the Estonian Prime Minister and the Austrian Chancellor in this regard when he met them recently as Heads of Government?

Now I find that I can ask questions about meetings with the British Prime Minister, the options presented after the December discussions or even the St. Patrick's Day visit to the US.  It is really not a good way to do that.  I am profoundly concerned about the viability of the December agreement and I think we need some opportunity in this House to debate that in a very frank and clear way.  It is important for both our UK and EU interlocutors to hear clearly the views of this House on that because it became crystal clear over the weekend that none of the options - a, b or c - can be achieved by the British Government or will be sustained by a majority in the British Government.  We need to have very frank discussions about that and where we lie in respect of that.<\/p>  <p>  My own question related to the meeting with the Estonian Prime Minister.  <\/p><p>Despite the distance, there are many synergies between Estonia and Ireland.  I acknowledge the important milestone in Estonian history.<\/p> <p> Did the Taoiseach discuss the notion of the transition arrangement with Mr. Ratas?  He said they had discussions on future relationships, in other words the final agreement between the European Union and the UK.  Did they discuss the interim agreement?  What is the Estonian position on free movement in the interim?  I presume Mr. Ratas's position is that Estonian citizens would continue to enjoy access to the United Kingdom.  Is that also our position?<\/p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, Estonia has been a leader in the digital economy.  It developed a concept of e-residency, which has been in place since 2014.  That allows non-Estonian citizens access to services, such as company formation, banking, payment processing and taxation.  I think it is a very good idea.  It gives e-residents a smart card that they can use for signing documents.  It is aimed at attracting entrepreneurs into the country.  Is it something the Taoiseach has reflected on and could we have something similar?<\/p> <p> Did the Taoiseach discuss the EU digital tax with Mr. Ratas?  Obviously the issue of changing how corporation tax works into a sort of sales tax would have a profound, negative impact on countries such as Ireland and Estonia.

The key issue was the regulatory alignment and essentially for the purposes of the North-South Border irrespective of whether the UK was in or out of the customs union there would be regulatory alignment.<\/p>  <p>  The bulletproof deal has since become a default deal that we do not want to get to.  This is in the Taoiseach's own words.  Michel Barnier and Commissioner Hogan have put it very starkly that if the UK stays out of the customs union and outside the Single Market, there will be a border.  That is in sharp contrast to what we were led to believe before Christmas.  Irrespective of whether it was over-hyped or oversold before Christmas, there was a clear sense which was communicated to us by Government personnel that what was agreed before Christmas was legally fireproof.

If President Trump were to come to Ireland, has the Taoiseach's protocol unit looked at the possibility or is it advising on whether that visit would include a visit to the Houses of the Oireachtas?

With regard to the Nordic-Baltic group, the Dutch Prime Minister and I, as well as Foreign Ministers and Finance Ministers, attended by invitation but we are not members of the Nordic-Baltic group.  I did not attend on the last occasion as I attended the European People's Party, EPP, summit.  A number of pre-meetings happen before European Council meetings, sometimes at regional level and sometimes at party level.  I decided to attend the EPP summit prior to the European Council meeting.  In attendance were President Tusk, President Juncker, Michel Barnier, Angela Merkel and Antonio Tajani.  I thought it was important to touch base with them before the European Council meeting which was held subsequent to that.  No decision has been made on the next meeting of the Nordic-Baltic group but it is fair to say that Ireland, the three Nordic countries and the three Baltic countries, along with the Netherlands, have very similar interests in a number of areas, particularly with regard to tax sovereignty, free trade and enterprise competitiveness.  We also have a similar approach to the future of Europe which we think should largely be led through the institutions and the leaders' agenda, and Donald Tusk's process rather than any particular proposals from particular governments.  We will continue to work closely on those issues.<\/p>  <p>  We may find that we have different allies on other issues, particularly with regard to agriculture and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget and related trade issues.

Austria's main concern relates to migration.  It had an experience of 1 million people crossing through the country, going to Germany and the Nordic countries, 90,000 of whom remained in Austria.  Austria is having real difficulties with that and it is the overwhelming political issue in Austria at the moment.  We differ on that particular issue.  Ireland has opted in to accepting quotas and has accepted thousands of people from Syria and other places whereas Austria and Hungary do not support a quota-based arrangement.  I am conscious that our geography is very different from Austria's and the experience of having 1 million people cross the country, with 90,000 staying, caused people in those countries to feel that they had lost control of their borders.  Even if we do not agree as to why different people have different views in different countries, it is good to understand why they have different views.<\/p>  <p>  Estonia had concerns about security and ambitions relating to the digital agenda.  Its major concern relating to Brexit is not trade and borders but rather the position of Estonian citizens already living in the United Kingdom.

We are very much aligned on that, as it is aligned with our objectives relating to the avoidance of a hard border.  On the EU digital tax issue, it is fair to say that neither country is enthusiastic but until countries see details of what is proposed, it is hard to form a considered view.

That will be hard to achieve but is absolutely our preferred outcome and is what we are currently working on.  The second option is the UK-specific solution.  It is up to the UK to come up with those proposals and convince the European Union that they can be done.  The third option, which I described at the time as a backstop and the Prime Minister describes as a last resort, is that there are special arrangements for Northern Ireland, where it continues to maintain full regulatory alignment with the European Union, allowing a hard border to be avoided.

I am very aware of the importance of the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme which issues annual payments in excess of &euro;200 million to more than 95,000 farmers.  The ANC scheme has always been recognised as a very important support for rural society and farmers across the country who farm constrained lands.  In light of the importance of the scheme, A Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to provide an additional &euro;25 million for the scheme in 2018.  I am pleased to confirm that this commitment was delivered in budget 2018 and that, subject to the European Commission&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to Ireland's rural development programme, this new funding will be available for payment under the 2018 ANC scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A number of different options were available in deciding how this additional funding was to be divided. \u00a0I was conscious of the need for money to be targeted at those farmers on lands with higher levels of constraint.  With this in mind and having considered the views of stakeholders, I have decided to distribute the additional &euro;25 million as follows: &euro;13 million will be allocated to the mountain type land\u00a0category; &euro;9 million will be allocated to the\u00a0more severely handicapped category; and &euro;3 million\u00a0will be allocated to the less severely handicapped category.  These allocations will have the effect of increasing the current payment per hectare rates across all land categories.  Those farming on what is known as mountain type land will see their payment increase from &euro;109.71 to &euro;135 on the first 10 ha and from &euro;95.99 to &euro;112 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 ha.  Farmers with land categorised as more severely handicapped lowland will see an increase from &euro;95.99 to &euro;104 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 ha, and those with less severely handicapped lowland will see an increase from &euro;82.27 to &euro;88.25 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 ha.  I am satisfied that these increased payment rates are consistent with the underlying logic of the scheme, where the highest level of support is targeted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land.  These changes must now be formally agreed with the European Commission by way of an amendment to our rural development programme.  My officials have initiated this process, with a view to introducing these new rates\u00a0for payment in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300022#U00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1518540300,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is unavoidably absent today.  The current forestry programme does not differentiate between a farmer and non-farmer but targets funding at all landowners who wish to convert lands to forestry.  It is important to note that the non-farmer category also includes recently retired farmers and the family members of existing farmers.  I am satisfied that the vast bulk of the grants and premiums paid under our forestry schemes are paid to, and remain in, rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Reinstating the farmer-non-farmer forest premium differential is not an option being considered by the Department.  Therefore the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 will continue to pay the same premium to all landowners to ensure that the maximum amount of land is available for afforestation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to land prices, the value of land is governed by the laws of supply and demand, and for those selling land, this is a positive development.  There are many reasons lands are put up for sale and there are also regional variations in terms of demand, supply and quality which influence the final price paid for land.  Forestry may be one of many factors which can influence movements in land prices.  According to my Department&rsquo;s own analysis, returns from forestry, while attractive for landowners, are not such as to drive excessive land prices.<\/p>  <p>  From an investment perspective, investors cannot afford to pay too much for bare forestry land given the returns available, and this should act as a natural brake for this type of investment.  For farmers, forestry offers a viable alternative enterprise which allows them to diversify their income stream towards the more stable timber market and for this reason the supports offered by the State are very much welcomed.<\/p><p> My Department is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the forestry programme 2014&ndash;2020, under which there will be proposals to make further improvements to the forestry schemes.  These improvements are aimed at encouraging farmers to see forestry as part of the farming enterprise as opposed to being an alternative to farming.

Large sections of the north west - the land to which the Deputy McConalogue referred, which is usually land of natural constraint - are being taken over by a monoculture of Sitka spruce forestry.  This is having an absolutely devastating effect on communities and farmers trying to buy adjacent land.  These farmers may be competing with farmers from very far away who are buying the land to obtain carbon credits from forestry to offset against other activities.  They are legitimately entitled to do this but, from the point of view of the people who live in the areas where the forests are being planted, it is devastating.

I realise the narrative on forestry in the communities to which he refers is not positive.  We all need to work collectively with the communities to explain the benefits.  The Deputy represents a constituency in which there is considerable employment downstream from the timber industry.  It is very valuable employment.  I am sure the Deputy agrees.  This employment would be put in jeopardy if we did not continue to have a supply of timber.  This message rarely gets out.  I refer not only to the major processing plants but also to local enterprises providing fuel and pellets for heating, for example.  In total, there are approximately 12,000 people working in the industry.  This is not to be sneezed at.  Significant export earnings are generated.<\/p>  <p>  I accept there is resistance, however.  Landowners almost regard forestry as throwing in the towel and accepting defeat.  A fundamental question must be asked, however, regarding what forestry will deliver for farmers, not through the selling of land and throwing in the towel but through tax-free income.  This is significant and sometimes overlooked.  We should try to acknowledge collectively that forestry has a significant role to play, including in terms of climate change mitigation.

As he is aware, the Irish dairy market, following on from broader EU and international trends, is currently in a much improved position compared to the relatively recent past.  Of course, we remain extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production.<\/p>  <p>  While the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place, particularly at the farm gate, the issue of intervention stocks overhanging that particular market remains a cause for concern arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder across the EU since September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  There are now approximately 376,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in public intervention stocks, effectively overhanging the EU skimmed milk powder market.  My Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to limit further stockpiling of skimmed milk powder in 2018 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed-price ceiling to zero, to which the Deputy refers.  I strongly argued that this measure should be specified as for 2018 only to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term.  This point was accepted and agreed in the final version of the measure as adopted by the Council through Regulation No. (EU) 2018\/147 of 29 January 2018, which came into effect the following day, 30 January.<\/p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of Ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative that the Commission remains vigilant in monitoring the market and that it have contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging, particularly in relevant markets, particularly the raw milk, butter and skimmed milk powder markets.  In common with the vast majority of EU member states where dairy production is of significance, I recognised that the current position on existing stocks could not be allowed to persist indefinitely and that there is general acceptance that doing nothing is not an option.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this measure does not represent a change to the fundamental provisions of the intervention mechanism, nor to the necessary supports that intervention provides during periods of market volatility.  Ireland has welcomed and made use of intervention during such periods of instability.  This measure responds and is framed around a very specific set of circumstances, namely very significant intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder, a significant divergence between skimmed milk powder and butter prices in negative and positive directions, respectively, and a generally more favourable market context in the EU dairy sector, including the farm gate in respect of more recent raw milk returns.<\/p>  <p>  I have clearly stated the system, as it evolves, will need to display flexibility in respect of adapting to market contingencies, including flexibility around proposed skimmed milk powder buying-in prices at tendering rounds, to react to the broader market situation at any given time.  The issue of current stocks cannot be disentangled from the issue of managing skimmed milk powder intervention in 2018 and beyond, however.  The issues involved, with respect to both market management and sentiment in the sector, are complex and require ongoing careful management.<\/p><p>Given the Commission's status among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the skimmed milk powder, SMP, market, and as such its capacity to affect market sentiment, it would be appropriate that it continues to act prudently and responsibly in the disposal of stocks.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed those stocks in a prudent manner.  My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other member states, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300023#V01200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541500,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Minister gave a very comprehensive reply but, unfortunately, I disagree completely with what he said.

Hopefully, we will not need that floor price in 2018 but unfortunately we needed it in 2016.  Skimmed milk powder never rose above the intervention price in 2017.

The measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January to 20 April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the introduction of a fodder transport scheme I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cashflow.

Therefore, in the recent budget we committed to the provision of funding for Teagasc for the development of a food innovation hub at Moorepark.

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter.  To immediately address this issue I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to this request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 basic payment measure and agri-environmental measures.  These payments commenced at the earliest date possible - 15 October 2017 - and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments, together with those issued under the areas of natural constraints measure, injected more than &euro;1.4 billion into the rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase, where necessary.<\/p><p>At this time I also requested Teagasc, through its farm advisory service, to identify farmers who would be most at risk of running out of fodder and provide them with support to carry out fodder budgeting on their farms and explore all viable options to ensure they had sufficient feed for the winter months.<\/p><p>In order to provide additional assistance for those livestock farmers severely affected by ongoing fodder shortages, mainly in parts of the west and north west, I introduced a targeted fodder transport support measure, operated through the co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was available and those where it was scarce.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January to 20 April 2018.<\/p><p>While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the west and the north west, the measure is not county specific within the region.  Teagasc is also monitoring the fodder situation in adjoining areas and will carry out further assessments, if necessary.\u00a0 Like all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers in a locality within the region identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their Teagasc adviser, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the cost of transport of fodder sourced through the co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>Teagasc assessment of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.  It is important to emphasise that this is a targeted and locally focused measure, centred on areas of fodder scarcity that normal local trading in fodder cannot service.  The measure will provide a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage towards the additional cost of transporting the fodder from the east and the south of the country to the affected areas of the west and the north west.  Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.  To ensure normal local trade in fodder is not disrupted, a minimum transport distance of 100 km will apply.<\/p><p>Financial assistance under the fodder transport support measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 on <i>de minimis <\/i>aid in the agricultural production sector.  No applications for support under the measure were received up to last Friday, 9 February.

They do not have enough fodder to keep their cattle fed, which is placing significant financial pressure and strain on already hard-pressed farmers.

As he will be aware, the Supreme Court judgments on the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2014 - SI 3 of 2014 - were delivered on 12 December.  This statutory instrument established a points system to apply to the licenceholder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy was detected.  My Department is examining the implications of the judgments on an urgent basis.  I expect this process to be completed shortly, and thereafter I intend to sign a new statutory instrument to revoke the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2016, SI 125 of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding stakeholder consultation, on 20 October I discussed with industry representatives at the sea-fisheries liaison group meeting my plans to introduce a new statutory instrument and explained some key amendments that I was planning and the justification for same.  I informed the meeting that pilot infringement proceedings by the European Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system had been taken against Ireland.  It remains an option for the Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licenceholders system.<\/p>  <p>  I also indicated at the meeting that there were serious implications for the release of funding under the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF.  The early enactment of legislation for the points system is essential to ensure the continued contribution by the EU to the costs of investment by the control authorities under Ireland's EMFF programme in infrastructure, equipment and skills to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of measures to enforce the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Commission is at this time poised to suspend EMFF payments to Ireland relating to control and enforcement because of delays in enacting legislation for the points system.  This legislation is a condition of the EMFF regulation and EU funding is tied to compliance with this condition.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the contents of the new instrument will, to the extent possible, take on board issues of concern relating to procedures and processes highlighted in the Supreme Court judgments and provide for appropriate procedures to ensure fairness in any relevant provision.  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non-Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependent.  The points system is equally applicable to foreign and Irish vessels fishing in our 200 mile zone.  This system will ensure that the majority of our law-abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300030#CC00800","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1518545100,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I must highlight the Minister's statement that he had consulted with the industry on 20 October.

I am raising issues with the 220, 220x and the 223 services on behalf of constituents.  The 220 is the service from Carrigaline through Cork city and on to Ovens.  The 220x is the same service with the addition of a service to Crosshaven.  The 223 is the Ringaskiddy to Cork city service and some of those buses go on to CIT.  The reason I am raising the issue is that I and others have been inundated with complaints about the quality of the bus service.  In particular, we have received complaints about the reliability of the service and ongoing capacity issues as well.  It appears that these routes are seriously under-resourced.  They are popular, successful and profitable routes and there are people who want to use public transport.  The types of issues that occur consistently unfortunately relate to buses running very late, buses being full or in some cases buses not turning up at all.  We are talking about people who rely on a bus service to go to college, school, work, a hospital appointment or to go about their day-to-day lives.  It is just not good enough.  I have tried to take this issue through the regular channels.  I have raised these concerns with Bus &Eacute;ireann directly.  It talks about traffic congestion, the need for greater investment in bus lanes and it says it is looking at increasing capacity on these routes.  I do not see any improvements happening at the moment and that is why I feel the need to raise these issues here today.<\/p>  <p>  The problems are both inbound and outbound and both the 220 and 223 serve communities that are rapidly expanding.  Towns like Carrigaline and Passage West are expanding very rapidly and they need a quality bus service.  I am not blaming the bus drivers, some of whom have provided really useful feedback on the nature of the timetable.  It may well be that the timetable needs to change to reflect the reality of traffic congestion which is not getting lighter.  It is not just in Dublin that there is traffic congestion; it is certainly in Cork as well.  More resources are undoubtedly needed.  There is no real-time information available.  If one is at a bus stop in Dublin or waiting for the Luas, the sign will say when the next Luas or bus will be along, for example, in two minutes or three minutes.  We do not have that service on these routes.  People stand there not knowing whether or not the bus will turn up.  That is the reality of the service that people are facing.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the extension of the city zone fares which both of these routes avail of.  The 220 and 223 are now deemed to be within the city zone.  That is a very beneficial reduction in fares, which is to be welcomed.  The message from people is that it is all very good and they welcome it but it is not much good if we do not have a service we can rely on.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a need to change routes and introduce new routes.  The town of Carrigaline should be connected with Passage West because there is a new primary care centre in Carrigaline, which the people of Passage West need to get to.  About 5,000 people work in the lower harbour area of Ringaskiddy and many of them live in Carrigaline.  There is no bus connection for them to get to work or to Little Island.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a lot of issues.  In some cases overtime is not available and is not being paid, which may explain why in some cases, buses have an out-of-service sign and are rushing back to the depot.  In other cases, private buses are being brought in, which means people cannot use the Leap card and so there is a loss of revenue to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister is in charge.  People are looking for answers and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300031#DD00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1518545700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this interesting issue.  I am not one who thinks it is a bad idea to bring up certain bus routes in Cork or anywhere in Ireland in the D&aacute;il.  I do not think any problem is too small for us to address because it may be a microcosm of what is happening elsewhere.  I am grateful to Deputy McGrath for bringing it up, although I may indeed wash my hands of some of the responsibility for it because of the structures the State has for dealing with these situations.  If this is a reflection of what is happening elsewhere, it is a good thing the Deputy brought it up today.  I hope I will give the Deputy a reasonably positive response.  I appreciate the fact the Deputy has raised the issue.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport.  I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  Deputies will understand that the operation of Bus &Eacute;ireann services is a matter for the company with oversight by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The NTA has entered into a contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of bus services in the State.  In accordance with the terms of that contract, the day-to-day operation of those services is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company is required to meet performance obligations on service delivery such as punctuality, services operated, vehicles in service and customer information.  The NTA has invested in a significant improvement to subsidised bus services in Cork city.  This has included the provision of cross-city services, increased frequency on existing services and new services linking residential areas to places of employment and education.  Further investment has been made in the city bus fleet which is 100% fully accessible and an increase in capacity through the purchase and deployment of double decker buses.  Passenger numbers have grown by 19.4% since 2013 to 12.6 million in 2017.  However, the 2017 numbers were lower than forecast due to the period of industrial action at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Further expansion of the Cork city network is planned in 2018.  For example, there are improved services planned on the Ballincollig-Carrigaline corridor, including routes 216, 220, 220x and 223 and frequency improvements on routes 202, 207a, and 208.  In addition, route 206 is planned to link with route 221 providing improved frequency to Glanmire via Cork Kent Station with the service also being extended to Cork Airport.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware Bus &Eacute;ireann has been experiencing some operational issues in the Cork area recently and that there have been some complaints regarding the non-arrival and late arrival of some services.  This apparent degradation of services for the customer is not acceptable and it is a matter for the company to resolve the issues promptly.  I take note of what the Deputy has said and presume the company will do the same.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised the NTA is currently liaising with Bus &Eacute;ireann regarding a number of complaints from Bus &Eacute;ireann customers regarding problems with services in Cork that it has received recently and no doubt some of them are from Deputy McGrath.  I understand the NTA wrote to Bus &Eacute;ireann last week asking that the company revert to the authority as a matter of urgency with the steps being taken by it to resolve the underlying issues and mitigate the effects of them in the short term until permanent solutions are put in place.  I assure the Deputy the NTA is continuing to monitor developments closely and has reminded Bus &Eacute;ireann of its performance obligations under its contract.  I look forward to this issue being resolved as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300031#DD00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1518546300,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

He can be sure these issues are not unique to the area I represent, but it is a matter for other Deputies to raise them on behalf of their constituents.  I would like the Minister to follow up on these problems with the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is welcome that there are plans to expand services, including the 220, 220X and 223, but will the resources be provided to back up the intention to expand these services because lack of capacity is a problem?

It is useful to hear the complaints on the floor of the House, particularly if there is an avalanche coming the Deputy's way.

To say his decision to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority under EU Regulation 598\/2014 has caused consternation is probably an understatement.  There is uproar in the community.  People certainly did not see this one coming because of the very obvious conflict of interest.<\/p><p>The regulation was intended to be the mechanism for the independent regulation of aviation noise designed to protect communities from that intrusion.  In order to transpose it, a competent authority had to be established to monitor such levels.  It is important because the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has made it abundantly clear that once the body is established, it will use it in order to try to overturn the two restrictions in place on the new runway and night time flights.  This is of vital importance to the surrounding community which does not resist construction of the runway <i>per se<\/i>but is asking that the terms and conditions on which permission was granted all those years ago when we were not as knowledgeable as we are now about the damage caused by aviation noise to the health and well-being of surrounding residents be upheld.  Even then, almost ten years ago, these conditions were imposed and the DAA has made no secret of the fact that it wants the restrictions to be lifted.  The local community thinks the idea of appointing Fingal County Council which gave the DAA the original permission without restrictions is absurd.  Not only that but 20% of the rates income of Fingal County Council comes from the DAA.  The council is renowned for its deferential relationship with the DAA, given the enormous value of the DAA to the surrounding community.  The idea of the council being able to be impartial against that backdrop seems crazy to residents. <\/p><p>It is ironic that the original choice, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, was broadly accepted by the community.  It has an international reputation for excellence and is highly technical in its assessment of this issue.  While it manages air traffic at Irish airports, there is no profit in it for it.  Its money comes from overflights, not use of the runway.  There is much less of a conflict of interest with the IAA which has the required experience. <\/p><p>I think I speak for the representatives from all of the parties who attended the briefing the Minister organised last week on this decision when I say we could not get our heads around the justification given by the Department, that the Minister was looking for an organisation that had expertise in making environmental impact assessments and dealing with noise and aviation issues.  With no disrespect to anybody in Fingal County Council, at a stretch, we might grant it the first one, but there is certainly no basis for the idea that it has expertise in dealing with noise and aviation issues, yet it has a clear conflict of interest.  The Minister needs to revisit this issue, go back to the drawing board and reconsider the IAA as the competent authority under the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300032#EE00500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1518546300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question and I am glad that it is being raised in the House, particularly after the briefing given to all of the spokespersons last week.  I know that the Deputy will understand it has been a very difficult journey dogged by legal problems for nearly two years which has led us to this conclusion, with which I am happy.  It was not easy because there will be people who, no matter who is appointed as the competent authority, will say this is the wrong one and that we should have appointed a different one, not least the lawyers, certainly Deputies and others.  That is understandable, which is why this is a useful debate.  I am happy now, having listened to the Attorney General, the IAA and others, that this is the correct appointment.<\/p>  <p>  I have made several contributions in the House on this matter over the course of the past 12 months or so, particularly in response to questions posed by Deputies Clare Daly and Robert Troy.  As the Deputy knows, the EU noise regulation, Regulation 598\/2014, establishes a set of common rules and procedures to deal with noise issues at major airports within all EU member states.  We do not have any option but to appoint a competent authority because of the EU regulation.  As the Deputy mentioned, it was previously proposed that the IAA would be designated noise regulator for the purposes of Regulation 598\/2014.  However, as I explained in the D&aacute;il before Christmas, when this approach was subject to final legal review, it was found to be impracticable in the light of emerging EU case law.  It was as much a surprise for us as it was for the Deputy.  Specifically, the advices were that the IAA would be conflicted, given its direct commercial interests in traffic growth at Dublin Airport.  Offseting these conflicts would have required the establishment of a noise regulation unit within the IAA that would have had to be wholly separate from the parent organisation in terms of resourcing, recruitment, performance management and human resources management.<\/p><p>This was considered wholly unworkable and clearly against corporate governance best practice.  Having re-examined the matter as to how best to implement the EU Regulation fully, Fingal County Council, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la as an independent appeals body, was considered the best way forward.  Fingal already has responsibilities under an EU noise directive, which covers non-airport noise, and it has experience and expertise in environmental impact assessments and in managing extensive public consultations.  There are quite a lot of synergies already and so it makes sense to give it responsibility for airport noise regulation.<\/p> <p> Unquestionably, Fingal will have to build some additional expert capacity and so the draft legislation will provide for additional funding to provide for this.  The Government has endorsed this proposed course of action and I now intend to get on with implementing it.  There are challenges.  This regulation has already proven quite a complex provision to transfer and align with existing Irish planning and development arrangements.  Indeed, on my instruction, as the Deputy has already alluded to, departmental officials met the Deputy and a number of other Members of this House last week to hear their views, concerns and also to talk over the complexities and challenges.  It is so important that the runway goes ahead, that we have a competent authority and that we involve anybody in this House and others outside in the decision-making process.  As I understand it, that engagement was constructive and it has been agreed to have follow-up engagement with the Members.  I hope the Deputy will attend those follow-up engagements.  My Department and I are sensitive to concerns raised and are willing to find an agreed way through these if at all possible.  It is my intention to publish a draft Bill as soon as possible.  Doing so is a priority.  It will set out precisely how the new regulator will operate in accordance with Regulation 598\/2014.  There will be plenty of opportunity for examination of the proposals as the Bill comes through the House.  I welcome them starting with pre-legislative scrutiny at the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, which will be attended by many Members and which can also be attended by others, including the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300032#EE00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518546900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that it has been a difficult journey, not least for the Minister because he is in a very difficult position.  The reality is that a previous Attorney General gave a diametrically opposed view on this issue to the one we currently have.  Previously, we were told that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, was the best organisation for the job and that a statutory instrument was sufficient to bring it into law.  Now we hear that there is a conflict of interest in the IAA and we need primary legislation.  We welcome the fact that there will be primary legislation but one of the purposes of this discussion is to tell the Minister in no uncertain terms that he will never sell Fingal County Council as an independent competent authority on these issues and it is best that we address those issues now rather than wasting even more time in dealing with this in the future.  Fingal Organised Residents United Movement, a community organisation that has been very vocal on this issue, has said that it wants to see Dublin Airport prosper and increased connectivity and has no wish to stop the development of the northern runway but it believes there needs to be a totally independent body.  The problem with the Minister's response is that it does not stack up to analysis because an independent body within the IAA is not wholly unworkable.  It already exists in terms of other areas like safety.  There are two independent bodies operating under the umbrella of the IAA.  It is entirely possible to set this up.  The IAA does not benefit financially from planes landing at the airport.  It mainly makes its profits from overflights so the conflict of interest is far less than it would be for Fingal County Council, which gets 20% of its rates from the DAA which has a disproportionate influence on development in that county and to which the council gave the go-ahead years ago without the conditions on night-time restricted flights, the retention of which is so important for the local community so that the airport can be a good neighbour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300033#FF00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1518546900,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I think it is unfair, or most unusual, of the Deputy to suggest that a local authority is conflicted in its role with regard to its statutory environmental protection and enforcement responsibilities and wider economic and physical development roles.  As the Deputy knows, local authorities already have a wide range of statutorily based regulatory and enforcement functions relating to environmental quality, planning enforcement and other areas which necessarily sit alongside their rateable income and property tax collection functions.  This is how local authorities operate.  Assigning Fingal County Council as the airport noise regulator is wholly aligned with that very long-established multifunctional role played by all local authorities.  Importantly, it will also be subject to independent appeal.  We must not forget that it will not be acting completely on its own.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be sitting there to hear appeals in all cases of noise regulation and it cannot be considered to have a conflict of interest.  I understand the Deputy's point of view.  I know that whoever we appoint will come under scrutiny, particularly from the lawyers.  Obviously, the IAA came across legal problems.  I know that this one will rightly come under scrutiny from Deputies and other Members.  This is why we have involved and will involve Deputies in as wide an engagement as possible on this and why we will do everything to ensure that their wishes are listened to and indeed adhered to and consented to by the Government so that we get the best possible result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300033#FF00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","time":1518546900,"counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300033#FF00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1518546900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>First, I record congratulations to PDFORRA and EUROMIL on winning their case against the State in the European Committee of Social Rights.  The committee ruled by 11 votes to two that Defence Forces personnel were having their right to organise breached and that the Government should recognise their right to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The committee also ruled unanimously - by 13 votes to zero - that the right of Defence Forces personnel to bargain collectively was being breached and that they should be able to participate in pay negotiations, so congratulations and hats off to PDFORRA and EUROMIL.  I also want to record here the historic role of the wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces whose protest movement in the 1980s paved the way for the creation of PDFORRA and whose recent work has helped raise general awareness of the dire working conditions endured by Defence Forces personnel and the consequences for their families in terms of living standards.  I have no doubt that this has been a source of pressure on this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State prepared to give a commitment in the House tonight that he will now arrange to meet Ms Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss putting in place the necessary arrangements in the wake of this important judgement?  I also ask him to give a commitment not to go down the road of obstruction, denial of rights and foot dragging, which this Government has attempted to do in recent years.  From the moment the Garda organisations won their equivalent case at the European Committee of Social Rights in the autumn of 2016, we put the argument to the Minister of State's office that the Government should short-circuit the EUROMIL case rather than force a rehash of the same arguments in Brussels.  The fact the Government persevered and contested this case all the way to the bitter end is shameful.  Even since the ruling in favour of the Garda organisations, there has been more foot dragging with a promise of a Bill to give effect to the Garda ruling only listed for this D&aacute;il session a full year and a half after the ruling.  A Bill of mine entitled the Industrial Relations (Defence Forces) Amendment Bill 2017, which grants trade union rights to the Defence Forces in anticipation of yesterday's ruling, passed First Stage last year.  The Government could easily progress this Bill to Committee Stage in this term.  The Minister of State might comment.<\/p>  <p>  The denial of union rights to the ranks of the Defence Forces has facilitated many abuses in terms of pay and working conditions.<\/p><p>The number of Defence Forces personnel on family income supplement alone is testament to this as is the exodus of technically skilled personnel in recent weeks and months.  There are issues still outstanding in respect of the Organisation of Working Time Act and the loss of annual leave, Lariam, hazardous working conditions in the Air Corps paint shop in Baldonnel and so on.  These issues have been argued out <i>ad nauseam<\/i>behind the closed doors of the conciliation and arbitration scheme run by the Department of Defence.  This is a sham process.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach holds the portfolio of Minister for Defence.  Some class of statement from him today regardless of this Topical Issue debate was warranted.  I call on him now to make a statement on this ruling and to commit to bring forward legislation immediately to give effect to it in this session.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply with interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300033#FF00500","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518547500,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The European Committee of Social Rights has considered a complaint submitted by EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, on behalf of PDFORRA, concerning the lack of certain rights for military representative associations in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In a non-binding ruling, the committee has concluded that prohibiting military personnel from the right to strike was not in breach of the European Social Charter, but that the charter was breached by prohibiting the representative associations from affiliating with a national employee organisation, such as ICTU, and in respect of the right to bargain collectively.<\/p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the conclusion of the European Committee of Social Rights that the prohibition on the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces is not a violation of the European Social Charter.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the complaint predates a number of significant Government initiatives.  Regarding collective bargaining, the Government established an independent Public Service Pay Commission in 2016 to provide objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.  The Permanent Defence Force representative associations took the opportunity afforded to them to make submissions to the commission.  Following the publication of the report of the public service pay commission, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Permanent Defence Force representative associations were subsequently invited to the negotiations on the agreement, which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  They were afforded equal standing with other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to acknowledge once again that in mid-December, both PDFORRA and RACO accepted the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  This provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus on the lower paid.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Defence Forces have a range of parallel complaint and adjudication mechanisms in law to compensate for the limitations on their access to the normal industrial relations machinery which applies in wider society.  This includes a redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces Ombudsman and a conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p>  <p>  The conciliation and arbitration scheme, since its inception in the early 1990s, has provided the framework to progress many successful negotiated agreements between Defence Forces management and the PDF representative associations.  However, there have been many changes in the industrial relations landscape in the intervening period.  In this regard I have initiated a fundamental review of the scheme to ensure that it remains efficient and effective for all parties.  I have appointed Mr. Gerard Barry to conduct the review.  While the focus of the review will be primarily on the operation of the Permanent Defence Force conciliation and arbitration scheme, on my instruction the terms of reference of the review require that the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights are considered as part of that process.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  The right to affiliate with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015, military personnel are subject to military law at all times.  By association with a trade union or similar body, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, members of the Defence Forces would have to comply with certain obligations and rules of that body.  This could have implications having regard to the roles assigned to the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have in the past and may again in the future, be called on by the Government to contribute to maintaining vital services.  Serious difficulties and conflict of interest for Defence Forces personnel would arise if the Government were to direct the Defence Forces to undertake a task to ensure the maintenance of essential services in an area where the trade union umbrella organisation has authorised any form of industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  It would be unfortunate for any question to arise over the authority of the Government to require military personnel to serve in such circumstances and to observe the commands given by their military superiors.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Report of the European Committee of Social Rights are receiving consideration.  There are a number of stakeholders involved who will also have input to the review of the PDF conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to pre-empt any conclusions arising from the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300034#GG00200","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1518547500,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I asked if the Minister of State would give a commitment to make arrangements to meet Ms Patricia King of the ICTU to put in place arrangements in the wake of this judgment.  The reply the Minister of State gave me is that the recommendation from the European committee is receiving consideration.  I note that reply.  I express disappointment at it.  I also take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State how long this consideration will take.  Is it consideration that will play out over days, weeks, months or years?  It will not be acceptable to the men and women of the Defence Forces and will not be acceptable to those who sit in these benches here and, I hope, others in this House, if the Minister of State attempts to kick to touch and do with the soldiers what the Government has done with garda&iacute;, which is to drag its feet for a long period of time.<\/p>  <p>  The one area where the European committee ruled unfavourably was in the area of the right to strike.  Basically its ruling leaves it to member states to uphold a ban and the point was made by the EUROMIL representative that the right to strike exists in the Austrian and Swedish armed forces.  The Minister of State said it was irreconcilable, but it exists in Austria and Sweden.<\/p>  <p>  I want to put on record my support for the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces notwithstanding the fact that this right is not being actively sought by PDFORRA.  The arguments against the right to strike are quite ridiculous.  No worker or group of workers embarks on a strike in a light-minded way.  Besides the financial hardship that comes with industrial action, public service workers weigh up the impact of their action on the service they provide to the public.  The best that the Government and others in the establishment can come up with is the laughable notion that the Defence Forces might take action in the midst of an invasion or attack.  Whether it is our Bill or the Bill that the Government must produce eventually, we will introduce Committee Stage amendments upholding the right to strike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300034#GG00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1518547500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry would love everyone to strike; all he wants is anarchy in here and outside here.

There comes a time when official replies do not always tally with what is happening in broader community and society.  This is an occasion where we have to address an underlying problem, the fact that the withdrawal of the Versatis patch has left many people with pain thresholds they can no longer tolerate, anxiety and concerns.  There is no doubt that there has been a huge escalation in the prescribing of the patch and in the demands on the budget.  At the same time, we have to accept that many people claim that this has had a major impact on their lives with regard to their ability to deal with pain.  Some of the longest waiting lists in the country include very long waits in the area of neurological illnesses and diseases and waiting for outpatient and inpatient appointments with neurological consultants and neurosurgeons.  That was only alluded to last week in the context of parliamentary replies in this Chamber last Thursday.  Huge numbers of people need this patch to function on a daily basis because they are waiting for a long time to see consultants or to get treatment for a neurological condition.  At the same time, we now have a situation where there is withdrawal of reimbursement and a change of what it can be prescribed for.  When a huge cohort of people are saying things, highlighting them on \"Liveline\" and in many other fora, and are contacting our offices, it reminds me of the time of the medical card debacle of 2014 when officialdom told us that there was no change of policy but at the same time it was evident that the change was having a profound impact on people's lives.

Somebody should put his or her hand up and say that he or she has got it very wrong.  Those who benefit from the patches, numbering tens of thousands, are being denied this medication that gives them relief.  I know the HSE has said it is based on clinical grounds but most people listening in or who have been on radio or television think it is a monetary decision.  A number of people contacted our office about this, and to say they are distraught is an understatement.  They are going through life with a condition that has chosen them.  They have not chosen the condition of chronic pain or neuropathic pain.  The patches give them some sort of relief.  The decision by the HSE has put those people outside of the reach of these patches.  The HSE might save money in the short term but it will cost the HSE much more money in the long term and hardship, particularly for the people benefitting.  I know the Minister remarked this morning that a radio station should not make decisions.  I think that is a flippant remark and I do not know if the Minister meant anything by it.

I welcome the opportunity to put some facts on the record of the House and to try to provide some guidance and information into how best patients might be able to proceed with regard to this important issue.  I am conscious of the impact of changes on individual patients and I would like to use this opportunity to set out the background to the decisions made by the HSE's medicines management programme and the process by which patients can apply for continued access to the patches.  I am concerned that I have heard many patients worried and upset about this and it is important that they hear how they can have their case reviewed.  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed to treat neuropathic pain from previous shingles infection, or post-herpetic neuralgia, PHN, in adults.  They have been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  When the patch was first introduced, its projected budget impact was low because of the very specific licensed indication.  It was clearly a clinical cause of concern when the reimbursement cost increased from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mostly from unlicensed use of the patch.  When one has clinicians in a medicines management programme seeing that a patch which was expected to be used for a small cohort of patients is now being used for a large cohort, and in many cases for indications for which it was never meant to be used, it is important and appropriate for clinicians in the HSE to review it.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the HSE's medicines management programme reviewed the use of this product.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that only 5% to 10% of prescribing of the patch has been for the condition it was licensed for.  In light of this clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for lidocaine patches from 1 September 2017, as has been done for other medication, including Entresto, a heart failure drug.  This process supports its appropriate use and ensures that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.  I heard accusations in this House earlier which led to my response about this being a Government decision.  It is not a Government decision.  This was a clinical decision made within the HSE.  Under this protocol, all patients who were receiving antiviral drugs for shingles were automatically registered on the HSE's primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, system.  These patients continue to receive this treatment under the community schemes.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically - which is the important word - receive this item.  The HSE advised GPs and pharmacies in August 2017 of these changes and of treatment alternatives for non-shingles patients.<\/p>  <p>  I stress that it is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the medicines management programme through the online system.  That medicines programme will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.  I am not talking about some abstract thing.  I am informed that, as of today, over 450 such applications from GPs have been approved.  That represents 450 people whose GPs have applied, saying that their patients do not have post-shingles but have a condition and need this patch.  Where a GP's application is rejected, it can be appealed.  I am informed that, as of today, over 220 appeals have been granted, which represents over 61% of appeals being accepted on clinical grounds.  Nearly 700 patients are receiving these patches despite that it is beyond the shingles indication.  While this is a clinical decision for the HSE and its medical experts, a process is in place for appeals.  I want to see that process applying the maximum compassion, which I have conveyed in the clearest possible terms to the HSE.  This needs to be done in a compassionate way where, if a GP highlights to the HSE's medicines management programme that a person needs these patches, that application and appeal would be looked upon compassionately.  I am encouraged to see the successful rate of appeals increasing from 50% in recent days to 61% today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300035#HH00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1518548100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>We had discretionary medical cards in previous times and the word \"compassion\" was invoked on numerous occasions.

Deputy Kenny is right that the process needs to be compassionate and I want to see that happen.  I am encouraged by the fact that the number of successful appeals has increased from 50% in recent days to over 60% today.  People can try if they wish for political reasons to liken this to previous issues in the health service but is not at all comparable.  This is a clinical decision.  This is about medication that, if used incorrectly or long-term, can have adverse consequences.  It is important that the medical experts in the HSE have a role in this area.  They are doctors too.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the answer I gave here earlier did not give anyone the wrong impression.  I am very concerned about the worry and upset I have heard from patients.  I want them to know that I am listening and I want them to receive the compassion and treatment they need.  The point I was making is that there is an application and appeals process in place that doctors can use to gain access to these patches for patients.  Almost 700 patients in this country have gained access to these patches as a result of that process.  I did not mean to be dismissive of people feeling that they had no option but to call a radio programme that is rightly highlighting an issue that is concerning people, but I have always been clear that when it comes to our citizens accessing medication, I want them to be able to do that through engaging with their doctors and in this case their doctor engaging with the medicines management programme.<\/p>  <p>  I am listening.  I believe those patients who need these patches can and must continue to receive them through the process that has been put in place. Doctors can make a case to the medical experts on behalf of their patients.  These applications are being turned around quickly and, as I said, the success rate for these applications is increasing significantly because of the compassionate approach being taken.  I want to see the HSE continue to take that compassionate approach so that anyone who needs these patches on the advice of their GP should be able to receive them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300036#JJ00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Third Interim Report from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes: Statements","time":1518548700,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300036#JJ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1518548700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300036#JJ00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1518548700,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  In particular, I would like to update Deputies on the commission's third interim report and the measures I am progressing with Government colleagues to respond to the issues which have emerged so far from its work.  I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery who participated in influencing measures in this direction.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, I published the third interim report from the commission in December last.  In its report, the commission requested a one-year extension to the timeframe to submit its three final reports.  The commission is of the opinion that all three reports, the confidential committee report, the investigative report and the social history module, are interlinked and should be presented together.  Following careful consideration, the Government decided to grant this extension.  The commission is now due to deliver all three reports by 17 February 2019.  I know that many former residents have been eagerly awaiting the completion of the commission's work.  I understand that many who contributed to the process and shared their information were disappointed and frustrated by this development.  However, it is important that we do not underestimate the scale and complexity of the task that the commission has been set.<\/p><p>The commission is seeking to establish facts and make findings and recommendations.  In outlining its reasoning for requesting an extension, the commission's third interim report states that the confidential committee has met a considerable number of former residents and others with connections to the institutions under investigation who wished to share their experiences.  The commission asked for more time to allow those who had applied, and were still waiting to share their experiences with it, to be heard.  Hearing these stories pays tribute to the memory of those who spent time in these places.  The commission also stated that its wide terms of reference have necessitated the collection and analysis of a vast range of documentary material relating to the institutions under investigation.  The analysis of all relevant records will not be completed until mid-2018.  All of the information uncovered during the course of this investigation plays its part in painting as full a picture as possible of the events and experiences of the time.<\/p><p>I recognise the absolute importance of the commission's work and I support it as it continues to investigate the matters within its terms of reference.  It is a comprehensive task and it needs time to complete its work.  The commission concluded at the time of publishing the interim report that extending the terms of reference into any further matters was not in the public interest, and I agree with this approach.  In recent days the commission has advertised nationally seeking to hear from anyone who has any personal knowledge, documentation or any other information concerning the burial arrangements of children who died in Bessborough mother and baby home in Cork.  I would strongly encourage any person with relevant information to contact the commission directly to divulge what they know to aid the investigation.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Over the course of 2017, I held two facilitated meetings with former residents and their families, one in Dublin and one in Cork.  More than 130 former residents of mother and baby homes and their advocates were in attendance.  I thank all who attended these meetings and acknowledge the generosity, willingness and courage of all participants in contributing to the dialogue.  One cannot but be moved by their stories.  The key theme that emerged from these facilitated consultations was &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;, the idea being that former residents want direct input into the decisions made on their behalf.  I have adopted this as my mantra.  The establishment of a collaborative forum is a progressive response to this idea.  Participants will create and drive forward a process that they can support and trust and actively participate in, recommending actions and solutions to address their concerns.<\/p><p>I am pleased to announce that Mr. Gerry Kearney has accepted my invitation to chair the collaborative forum.  Over the course of his career, Mr. Kearney has demonstrated a strong commitment to public service as former secretary general of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  He was appointed chairman of the Moore Street consultative group established to consider views on the best way forward for Moore Street, a monumental task in diplomacy I think Deputies will agree.  I strongly believe that gives him the expertise and management experience required to work with the forum.  His experience will be of considerable benefit to the forum in developing proposals and framing its recommendations.  I know that Mr. Kearney is looking forward to beginning what we hope is an extremely engaging and fruitful endeavour.<\/p><p>I have published a charter for the forum that will facilitate its work and that gives the blueprint for its methodology and demonstrates my commitment to innovative approaches to facilitate and empower former residents to contribute actively to decisions on matters that affect their lives.  The forum will consist of 20 members.  I am moving forward in identifying members for the selection panel that will establish the collaborative forum.  Selection of the correct people is critical to the success of the project.  The selection panel will include representation from the areas of human rights, former residents' advocate groups and academics with experience in this field.  I have made contact with these organisations and individuals and I am now awaiting confirmation of their agreement to participate.  I hope to announce the members of the panel shortly.  I hope they will have held their first meeting by the end of February.  I will then be advertising for members of the public and interested parties to express an interest formally in participating in the forum.  The selection panel will select the members of the forum from these expressions of interest at its second meeting, which should take place in early March.  I anticipate that the collaborative forum will meet on a monthly basis for a period of at least a year.  If it reaches consensus on any issues before then, however, I will of course be happy to hear from it.<\/p> <p> The forum will establish three sub-committees, which will cover a large range of issues of concern to former residents, such as terminology, identity and representation for former residents; health and well-being supports; memorialisation; and the recording of personal narratives.  I thank the Government for its support in establishing the collaborative forum.  I look forward to the beginning of its work.<\/p> <p> I have previously relayed my commitment to the House to inviting the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Mr. Pablo de Greiff, to come to Ireland.  I believe he can assist us in our endeavours to establish the truth and advise us on how best to move forward and deal with this part of our history.  Arrangements are at an advanced stage and I expect an invitation to be issued to Mr. de Greiff in the coming days.<\/p> <p> As we approach the anniversary of the tragic findings in Tuam in March 2017, I wish to update the House on the progress being made in responding to the discovery of the burial chambers.  Deputies will know I commissioned a team of international experts to produce a technical report.  It advises of five options, which are now available to us.  The team was appointed to ensure that any action taken on the site is in line with international best practice.  The report is a detailed technical document.  It outlines the unique nature of the site and the vast technical challenges involved.  The options range from memorialisation with no further excavations in option one to exhumation, forensic examination and further investigation of the wider site in options two to five.  All options can include memorialisation and appropriate internment at the site.<\/p> <p> Having visited the Tuam site several times, I am extremely conscious that this is a very sensitive and difficult matter for many former residents, their families and those living in the vicinity of the site.  I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to contribute to the discussion on the future of the site has the opportunity to do so.  I have asked Galway County Council to facilitate an independent consultation process on the five options as presented in the expert technical group's report.  The contributions from these consultations will be used to produce a report that will inform the interdepartmental committee, which in turn will make proposals to me on these sensitive matters.  I will bring these proposals to the Government for its final recommendation.<\/p> <p> Galway County Council has asked interested parties to complete a questionnaire-type document to generate data to use as part of the consultation process.  A number of families and representatives have contacted me to express their concerns about the approach and methodology used to gather information.  It appears that some have likened it to a simplistic popular voting process.  The process is far more comprehensive than that.  I have raised these concerns with Galway County Council.  I would like to assure the House that there is no intention to trivialise the memories or feelings of those wishing to partake in this process by using such a document.  The key part of this process is to offer those with an interest to express their opinion and collate this information.<\/p> <p> The consultation process has been designed to facilitate various parties while ensuring there is certainty in regard to the preferred course of action of each respondent.  I expect Deputies will be asking me some questions or making comments on that.  I look forward to coming back to this in my concluding remarks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300036#JJ00600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518549300,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her submission.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomed the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation when it was established.  We recognise the vital importance of the commission in delivering justice and accountability for all those affected by mother and baby homes in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The third interim report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation makes a request to extend the deadline for its reports on its findings on the institutions being investigated.  This would change the deadline to February 2019.  It should be noted that this represents the third extension of the deadlines for these reports.  While we appreciate that the commission is undertaking a complex and somewhat unpredictable task, Fianna F&aacute;il is of the view that the commission must complete its work as quickly as possible as it is an important mode of investigation and recognition for the experiences of Irish women and their children in these homes.  All three reports should be issued together.<\/p>  <p>  We have always supported this commission as a means to bring justice to the victims of the homes and we remain supportive of it.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the publication of the third interim report.  While I would like us to be at the final stage now, we will stick with the process because we want to see it through.  It is 12 months since I stood before the Minister on this matter and I believed we would be coming to the end of the process today.  We will try, however, to reach the end as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Given the UN comments about the current terms of reference being too narrow and feedback from survivor groups, we are supportive of these terms being expanded, as the Minister has outlined.  Furthermore, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the establishment of a forum for survivors to share their experiences and viewpoints in an open and safe environment.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of mother and children in these institutions is a dark chapter in our country's history and it is a complex issue.  Questions still abound about the nature of justice and retribution for survivors and we must be thorough in our search for the best possible model of justice for survivors. <\/p>  <p>  Now, as always in this process, we believe it must remain survivor focused.  While I cannot critique the Minister's speech, I believe it is survivor focused.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the formation of the forum.  I welcome the panel and the fact that survivors of the homes can engage in the process and have representation.  I welcome the fact the forum will have human rights people.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred in her speech to Galway.  As spokesperson for children and youth affairs and coming from the constituency of Galway East, which includes Tuam, it would be very remiss of me not to focus a little on the experiences on the ground in Tuam.  I spoke earlier this evening to Tommy, about whom I spoke this time last year, to receive an update on how he feels the process is progressing.  He urged me yet again to stay with the process.  He thanked the Minister for the work taking place.  He had a number of concerns over Galway County Council, which the Minister has adequately addressed.  While I do not mean to be critical, I wish to ask some questions that need to be teased out a little more.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lack of clarity at present on the role of Galway County Council in respect of some voting that was taking place.  The Minister explained it may have to do with the panels or selection criteria but those with whom I have been communicating do not know the exact role the council will play in the future.  Will it spearhead the process or will an independent person do so for it, drill down deep and engage?  That is one of the issues Tommy wanted addressed.  I can understand that.  Would the Minister believe people started to fill in the questionnaires only on Sunday night?  It is in light of the fact that we are here on a Tuesday evening that the engagement was at that level.<\/p>  <p>  The interim report states there is one institution for which records are probably not available and one whose records may be available but which are difficult to extract from a larger collection.  Does the Minister know exactly the mother and baby homes on which there are missing data and whose records are hard to find?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300037#KK00200","speaker":"1231"}]
