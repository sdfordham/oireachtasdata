Currently, Ireland's transport demand and emissions are increasing, with approximately three quarters of all journeys made by private cars accounting for over 55% of our transport emissions.  Increasing modal shift away from cars and towards public transport and active travel will play a vital role in our national mitigation effort.

Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy. Considerable progress has been achieved\u00a0in increasing capacity on the light and heavy rail networks.  For instance, the Luas Cross City project is scheduled for completion before the end of the year and it is estimated that the new line will add an extra 8 to 10 million journeys per annum on the Luas network.

In this context, on 23 January 2017, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan T.D. and I hosted an All-Island Dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector.  At that event Tourism Ireland presented on the research they had commissioned to assess the propensity of consumers living in Britain to travel overseas in a post Brexit world.  The research shows that 7% of people living in Britain say they are less likely to holiday overseas in 2017.  The research also indicates that spending patterns are likely to change, e.g. 50% of people expect that they will spend less while on holiday abroad.<\/p><p>Tourism Ireland also presented research which estimated that outbound travel from Britain will decline by 2.5% in 2017.  Given Ireland's reliance on Britain, from where 41% of our overseas visitors came in 2016, tourism to Ireland is likely to be more impacted than to any other destination.<\/p><p>Tourism Ireland's strategy for responding to Brexit will involve various strands, including defending key segments of the British market, very focussed competition in existing markets in Europe and North America, and pursuing new, potentially lucrative, markets further afield.  <\/p><p>In terms of markets further afield, a commitment is given in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement <i>&quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash;  Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;<\/i>to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.<\/p><p>As regards competing more vigorously in existing markets, a key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification which has seen Mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue and will see the United States overtake Britain as the number two contributor to tourism revenue over the next few years.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.<\/p><p>In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.

The IRPP was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time bound.<\/p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.<\/p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>In relation to the EU Relocation Programme, Ireland has to date taken in 241 people from Greece.

An IRPP mission to interview 80 people took place in Athens from 12 &ndash; 16 December.  A further mission has already taken place in January which interviewed 61 people.  An IRPP team are currently on the ground in Athens interviewing another group of over 90 asylum seekers.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme. <\/p><p>Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  However, as explained in responses to previous Parliamentary Questions, matters relating to security assessments of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation from Italy to Ireland remain to be resolved.

This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve this 20% target by way of a twin-track approach (i) a civilian by default policy  and (ii) the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational policing posts and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  <\/p><p>The &quot;civilian by default&quot; policy refers to a policy where all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, are to be filled by suitably qualified civilian staff.  In relation to the redeployment policy, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority to identify posts suitable for redeployment having regard to the indicative figure of 1,500 posts identified by the Garda Inspectorate in its report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot;.  These policies are designed to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, trained police men and women, are available for and utilised in operational areas.  The Authority, in view of its statutory functions in relation to approving the number of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appointing or approving the appointment of such staff has an important role to play in this regard. <\/p><p>The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in this year's budget will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.  These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.<\/p><p>In addition, and again having regard to Garda Inspectorate report I have already mentioned, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.  It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level.  In this regard, the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out.  The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained.<b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table the number of civilian staff for  each of the years from  December 2010 to 31 December 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Commissioner regarding the civilian strength in the years 2010 and 2011 and I will write to the Deputy on receipt of same.  <table><tr><th>YEAR END<\/th><th>CIVILIAN STRENGTH<\/th><th>GARDA STRENGTH<\/th><th>TOTAL STRENGTH<\/th><th>PERCENTAGE CIVILIAN<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>2028<\/td><td>13,424<\/td><td>15,452<\/td><td>13%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>2071<\/td><td>13,093<\/td><td>15,164<\/td><td>14%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>2054<\/td><td>12,799<\/td><td>14,853<\/td><td>14%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>2006<\/td><td>12,816<\/td><td>14,822<\/td><td>14%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>1998<\/td><td>12,943<\/td><td>14,941<\/td><td>13%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800069#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Data","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800069#WRF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[6132\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800069#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Syrian refugees the State has accepted in 2015, 2016 and to date 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Ireland is one of 27 States that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.

My officials' understanding is that it relates to the inclusion of an institution that is not one of the 12 covered by Scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage as to do so might serve to prejudice the respective ongoing consideration processes. <\/p>  <p>  The Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme was set up following the publication of the report in February, 2013 of an Inter-Departmental Committee set up to establish the facts of the State's involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.  It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.  Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.<\/p>  <p>  The centre named in the details supplied with one of the questions above is An Grian&aacute;n Training Centre.  Although located on the same complex as the Magdalen Laundry in High Park, i.e. one of those 12 named institutions, An Grian&aacute;n was a separate institution in its own right.  Its function was to rehabilitate teenage girls and provide education to prepare them for reintegration into society.  It thus served a different purpose to that of the traditional Magdalen institutions which dated back to the 19th century and which were open to women of all ages.  An Grian&aacute;n Training Centre, officially established in 1971, had a separate legal status as a certified place of detention and an approved residential children's home.  An Grian&aacute;n is among the 130 institutions listed in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 and was therefore covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from An Grian&aacute;n's own separate legal status and its different function to that of a Magdalen laundry, it should be further noted that the terms of the Scheme specifically exclude institutions that are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme.  This is to prevent a situation arising where an individual could receive compensation under two separate schemes for the same period of time spent in one institution.<\/p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to give some background to the operation of the Scheme.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  Processing of all applications under the Scheme operates on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have an incomplete or no record for an applicant, my officials must carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive; they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  To date, over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme.  The Scheme remains open to new applications but it is important to note that decisions have been made on all of the 819 applications made to date.  The difference between that figure and the 669 payments made is accounted for by refusals and for other reasons including probate cases, applicants still considering provisional offers, and the application of the Assisted Decision Making Act, 2015 in relation to those women who lack the necessary capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension in recognition of the fact that they were not paid for the work they did while in the laundries.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 provided for certain services to be made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the women.  The services, which are free of charge, include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy.  The HSE has administrative arrangements in place for health and social services for women living outside Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800070#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme Data","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800070#WRG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[6309\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800070#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the investment funds for which applications under the immigrant investor programme have been approved to date; the investment funds for which such applications have been refused; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that currently there are three Funds approved by the Central Bank from which applications will be accepted to the Immigrant Investor Programme (IIP).

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency in vetting has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where has been such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.<\/p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.

This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.

This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.<\/p>  <p>  All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy may be aware, section 3.5 (Ensuring Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Action 62 of the APJ 2017, officials from my Department will collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.

The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.

Working capital\/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Fuel and Tobacco Products","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[6147\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the number of seizures of illicit cigarettes and tobacco has dropped 16% from 7,154 seizures in 2015 to 6,024 in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>I am assured by Revenue that action against illegal activity involving tobacco products is a central element of their work and that significant successes continue to be made in tackling this illegal trade.

Seizure statistics are also very variable because of the effect of individual very large seizures on annual data.

I am advised that the proposed structure was first presented to the NAMA Board in February 2010 and was formally approved by the Board in June 2010.  The Revenue Commissioners were informed of the proposed structure in 2010 and raised no objection to it.<\/p><p>It is important to note that\u00a0NAMA's use of Section 110 structures is not new information.  NAMA has repeatedly and publicly disclosed its utilisation of SPVs, which include Section 110 structures,\u00a0in its Annual Reports.  The C&amp;amp;AG has also been aware of NAMA's use of Section 110\u00a0company structures since NAMA's inception.  In October 2010, the C&amp;amp;AG published its Special Report entitled\u00a0&quot;National Asset Management Agency - Acquisition of Bank Assets.&quot;  Appendix E within this report\u00a0outlines\u00a0in detail\u00a0NAMA's Group Structure and its use of Section 110 Companies.  It also contains a detailed description of the principal tax benefits that accrue to a qualifying Section 110 company.  This report is publically available at : .<\/p><p>NAMA's accounts have been audited, since inception,\u00a0by the C&amp;amp;AG and filed with Revenue and reflect activity by NAMA that is, and has been, operating in full compliance with the tax code.  Following\u00a0the change that\u00a0we, as a legislature, made\u00a0to the tax law governing Section 110 companies last year, NAMA paid &euro;158 million to the Revenue Commissioners as a preliminary tax payment to reflect its expected tax obligations under this new tax regime.  Thus, NAMA has always and continues to act\u00a0in accordance with tax law.  Through this payment, NAMA\u00a0is now simply moving,\u00a0as would be expected, to operate\u00a0in line with the recent\u00a0change\u00a0to tax legislation.<\/p><p>Under Section 214 of the NAMA Act, NAMA,\u00a0the Agency - which owns 49% of the NAMA Group companies, is exempt from income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  NAMA Group companies, which contain all of the assets, liabilities and activities\u00a0of NAMA, do not benefit from such an exemption and are\u00a0tax-equivalent to any other market operator.<\/p><p>The tax\u00a0exemption of the NAMA Agency does not adversely affect the Exchequer given that any surplus generated by the NAMA Group companies will accrue to the NAMA\u00a0Agency and will vest in the\u00a0State on a tax neutral basis.<\/p><p>The purpose of utilising Section 110 companies was\u00a0to ensure that there was no unnecessary cash leakage from within the NAMA Group.  This is no different to any other\u00a0market operator.  In NAMA's case, this was particularly important given the need to redeem guaranteed senior debt expeditiously and also the need to apply available cashflow to fund development projects ultimately intended to preserve and enhance the State's return from acquired assets, as required by Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Under an\u00a0alternative tax regime, the amounts applied by NAMA towards debt redemption and development funding may well\u00a0have been different.<\/p><p>I would also point out to the Deputy that all NAMA proceeds, whether through tax payments or a dividend surplus at dissolution, are ultimately destined to be transferred to the State.<\/p><p>I am advised that some NAMA entities are minority shareholders in a limited number of investments.

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Agri-Taxation Review found that long-term leasing has a number of advantages over the more traditional conacre system and it recommended the continuation and enhancement of measures to assist in rebalancing the market in its favour,\u00a0including the amendments brought forward to\u00a0this tax incentive.  This tax relief has a very specific policy aim of accelerating land mobility and productivity\u00a0through making additional agricultural land available to farmers\u00a0on a medium to long term basis for husbandry purposes.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of specific\u00a0criteria that must be met in order to qualify for this relief, including the use of the land itself, that the lease must be completed in writing, it must\u00a0run\u00a0for a minimum of 5 years, and that it cannot be made between connected parties.  The incentive is targeted and designed to achieve a specific policy objective in terms of making more land available for husbandry and therefore increased agricultural production.  Extending the relief such that it was available for the leasing of agricultural land to sporting organisations, would have no impact on the achievement of the socio-economic objectives for which the exemption was designed, and could potentially, lead to circumvention of the original policy intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Controls","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[6306\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800071#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of visits by Customs and Excise officers to Casement Aerodrome in each of the years 2013 to 2016 and to date in 2017; the number of those visits that were not notified in advance to the owners, officials and staff of the location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a decision on whether to undertake a visit to or an intervention at an aerodrome is dictated by Revenue's assessment of risk, having regard to a range of factors, including intelligence.

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.<\/p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.<\/p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.<\/p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.<\/p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.<\/p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.<\/p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight<\/i>online programme &ndash; aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.<\/p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.<\/p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.<\/p><p>Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.<\/p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.<\/p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.<\/p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However, the following table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.<\/p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4 million and in 2016 the total number of student  for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.<\/p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:<\/p><p>- Tourism\/Hotel\/Leisure\/Event<\/p><p>- Hospitality and Culinary<\/p><p>- Heritage and Cultural <\/p><p><b><font color=\"#1F497D\">  <\/font><\/b>I also<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>Summary of 2015-2016 Tourism and Hospitality

The remaining 218 were special classes service children with mild to moderate\/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties including speech and language difficulties. <\/p><p>There are currently 1,153 special classes,\u00a0which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.\u00a0 Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes.<\/p><p>The NCSE has advised that there are almost 18,000 students with ASD attending schools nationally. Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post primary ASD classes. <\/p><p>The NCSE continues to review special class placement requirements nationally and have informed the Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.<\/p><p>The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school\u00a0to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.  Of the total enrolment in schools currently 68% of students are enrolled at Primary Level (which includes all Special Schools) and 32% are enrolled at Post Primary level.<\/p><p>As such my Department does not consider the lower number of Post Primary Special classes for students with ASD currently constitutes a shortage of placements.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department acknowledges that there are challenges in opening special classes in some Post primary schools.  The NCSE is working with these schools to address this. <\/p><p>My Department\u00a0continues to\u00a0consider all options to improve the situation, including whether there is a need for legislation.  However, my Department is of the view that the legislation option carries significant risks and would clearly prefer that all schools would open classes where needs arise voluntarily.  My Department believes that, in the light of recent improvements in Special Class numbers in Post Primary schools, there are some grounds for optimism that schools are becoming more positively disposed to requests to open such classes.<\/p><p>The attached NCSE guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes as requested by the Deputy.  The guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.<\/p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, my Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800073#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[6260\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a person (details supplied) can be put on the pay rates that were in existence in 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The teacher\u00a0the Deputy refers to\u00a0is employed in the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult with the NEPS service should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to the Principal raising the situation with NEPS. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Incidence","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[6269\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in Fingal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[6271\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800074#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children availing of autism spectrum specific services in Fingal, by type of service, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 141 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to ensuring that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.<\/p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of children with ASD who are unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports, they may be enrolled in special classes within mainstream schools or in special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions relate to the prevalence of children with a diagnosis of ASD and those availing of ASD services in a specific area, I have referred the questions to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for their consideration and direct reply.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE's Autism Policy Advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Schools noted that there were almost 14,000 students diagnosed with autism in schools.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<\/p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  The Valuation Acts come under the aegis of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  In a revaluation all rateable property within a rating authority area is revalued so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.  Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.<\/p>  <p>  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in ten local authorities, including Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes from 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.

Since taking up office as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I have been open to ideas and proposals from private sector bodies to assist the delivery of social housing and affordable private housing.  I have met with a range of organisations, including representative bodies, private companies and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).<\/p><p>On 14 June 2016, I met with Irish Residential Properties REIT plc where the matters of housing and building regulations were addressed.

Meetings were held involving WK Nowlan Property Ltd. on 7 September 2016 and 25 January 2017, which I attended, where proposals to improve the delivery of affordable housing were raised.  On 22 September and 6 October 2016, I attended meetings involving the Construction Industry Federation where housing development issues were addressed.  On 29 September 2016, I attended a meeting with Atelier Capital LLP, a private body interested in investing in student accommodation provision.  On the same date I participated at an event hosted by the Cork Chapter of the Irish League of Credit Unions at which the potential for credit union investment in social housing was addressed.<b><\/b>On 19 October 2016 I met with a representative of the European Investment Bank, during which the potential for investment in social housing was discussed.<\/p><p>A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the Mortgage to Rent Scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for Mortgage to Rent and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.  In this regard, Minister of State English met with Beacon Social Housing on 1 July and 21 September 2016, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) on 21 September 2016, Bartra Capital on 1 December 2016 and the Arizun Group on 15 December 2016.<\/p><p>Currently, the mortgage to rent scheme relies on Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) purchasing from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.

The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.<\/p><p>I routinely meet with Approved Housing Bodies in the course of my work, where issues relating to investment by the voluntary housing sector in social housing are raised.

The Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016, further reinforces the Government's commitment to the area of urban regeneration.  <\/p><p>In this context, the Government launched the Town and Village Renewal Scheme last August with an allocation of &euro;10 million in funding for the year.  A sum of &euro;380,000 was made available to each of the 26 counties for 2016 under this initial phase of the scheme.  Local Authorities, in conjunction with local communities and businesses, were each invited to submit up to eight proposals by the end of September for approval.  Following an assessment of the proposals received, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs <b><\/b>announced (on 4 November) details of 172 towns and villages which will benefit from the funding available under this year&rsquo;s Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  The full list of towns benefitting under the scheme is available on the website of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (<i>www.ahrrga.gov.ie<\/i>).  Increased funding of &euro;12 million has been provided in Budget 2017 to enhance this scheme with a view to increasing the attractiveness and sustainability of our towns and villages as places in which to live and work. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to examining a series of further initiatives, such as:<\/p><p>-the introduction of a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate urban centres and villages throughout Ireland,<\/p><p>-  examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors,<\/p><p>-  the establishment of a National Register of Derelict Sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes,<\/p><p>-  the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional CPO capabilities, and <\/p><p>-  various other measures, which were further developed under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<i>,<\/i>and especially those under Pillar 5 aimed at re-using vacant housing stock and which have already been launched, such as &ndash;<\/p><p>-  the Repair and Lease Initiative, providing funding to the owners of vacant properties for their refurbishment and subsequent long-term leasing to local authorities for social housing purposes (&euro;140m funding over 5 years), <\/p><p>-  the Buy and Renew Initiative, facilitating local authorities to purchase and renew housing units in need of remediation and make them available for social housing use (&euro;25m funding for 2017),<\/p><p>-  the purchase by the Housing Agency of vacant buy-to-let properties on the portfolios of financial institutions and investors for social housing use (&euro;70m funding in 2016).  <\/p><p>To drive forward these and other considerations, a Working Group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal and comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant bodies, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.

The primary objective of the first NMP is to track implementation of measures already under way, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration will focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond\u00a02020 and out to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  I recently published a\u00a0briefing document\u00a0outlining the development of the NMP to date.

A public consultation is planned for mid-March before a final plan is submitted to Government in early June.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A key part of developing the NMP has been the preparation of appropriate technical, environmental and economic analysis to inform the decision-making process as to what should be included in the plan.  These analyses are still ongoing as part of the iterative approach to the development of the plan, and will be an important input into resource allocation as part of future expenditure planning, including as part of the Capital Review. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that funding climate action to the required level presents an enormous challenge for Ireland.  Early action is imperative to find the most cost-efficient and cost-effective solutions.  However, finding the appropriate and most equitable manner to address this issue is not going to be easy, particularly given the economic circumstances of recent years and where finances are still continuing to stabilise and recover.  A whole-of-Government approach is essential to\u00a0identify the optimal mix of measures\u00a0and policy tools to enable an effective transition.

However, the evidence of a good adult spawning stock over\u00a0five years would\u00a0indicate a\u00a0healthy population of juvenile salmon\u00a0which migrate to sea and return to the Owenea as adults to spawn and replenish the stock.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Harvest<\/th><th>Catch and Release<\/th><th>Total \u00a0Angling Catch<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>252<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>299<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>177<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>231<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>286<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>355<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>345<\/td><td>110<\/td><td>455<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>437<\/td><td>120<\/td><td>557<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800085#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800085#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[6237\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800085#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if consideration will be given to appointing a number of liaison officers from his Department to deal with different regions in taking broadband queries on behalf of members of the public submitted by elected representatives; if further consideration will be given to supplying elected representatives with the contact details of a liaison person from each of the broadband service providers within regions that elected representatives can communicate with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department welcomes queries from public representatives and members of the public in relation to the National Broadband Plan (NBP) and has a dedicated inbox,\u00a0<i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie<\/i>,\u00a0for this purpose.

This provides for a future proofed-solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.

The Preclearance service is available to all travellers on a voluntary and non-discriminatory basis.  The terms and conditions of the Preclearance arrangements with the US are covered by an International Agreement and by domestic legislation, the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009.<\/p>  <p>  The preclearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and the laws of Ireland apply at all times, enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is expressly confirmed at Article II(5) of the Preclearance Agreement.  Given the fact that US law does not apply, provision is made at Article II(6) of the Agreement to confirm that passengers who wish to avail of preclearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse preclearance in accordance with its laws.<\/p>  <p>  If someone is refused permission to fly to the US at preclearance in either Dublin or Shannon Airports, the passenger then becomes the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who deal with them, in line with Irish law and in accordance with\u00a0the full human rights protections that apply.\u00a0 A refusal at US Preclearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland.\u00a0 If they apply for asylum they will be dealt with in the normal way or if they wish to return to their point of origin they will be facilitated.\u00a0 These are issues for Irish Immigration authorities and US officials have no role in relation to them.\u00a0 It should also be noted that my Department does not have responsibility for policy in relational to international refugees.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement does not conflict with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, nor does it give rise to any breach of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.\u00a0 The Agreement expressly provides that\u00a0nothing in the Agreement diminishes the rights enjoyed by individuals under the Constitution and laws of Ireland or the US.\u00a0 While the right to travel is recognised under the Irish Constitution, there is no right under the Irish Constitution whereby Ireland could require another sovereign State to allow an individual entry to that State.\u00a0 The right of a passenger to enter the US is a matter for US law.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, by giving one year's written notice to the other party.  There is no provision in the Agreement for suspension.  Therefore, Ireland has an obligation, under International law, to adhere to the terms of the Agreement unless it is terminated in accordance with the procedure laid down.

In this context, on 23 January 2017, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan T.D. and I hosted an All-Island Dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector.  At that event Tourism Ireland presented on the research they had commissioned\u00a0to assess the propensity of\u00a0consumers\u00a0living in Britain to travel overseas in a post Brexit world.  The research shows that 7% of people living in Britain say they are less likely to holiday overseas in 2017.  The research also indicates that spending patterns are likely to change, e.g. 50% of people expect that they will spend less while on holiday abroad.<\/p><p>Tourism Ireland also\u00a0presented research\u00a0which\u00a0estimated that outbound travel from Britain will decline by 2.5% in 2017.  Given Ireland's reliance on Britain, from where\u00a041% of our overseas visitors came in 2016, tourism to Ireland is likely to be more impacted than to any other destination.<\/p><p>Tourism Ireland's strategy for responding to Brexit will involve various strands, including defending key segments of the British market, very focussed competition in existing markets in Europe and North America, and pursuing new, potentially lucrative,\u00a0markets further afield.<\/p><p>In terms of markets further afield, a commitment is given in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement <i>&quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot;<\/i>to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.<\/p><p>As regards competing more vigorously in existing markets,\u00a0a key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification which has seen Mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue and will see the United States overtake Britain as the number two contributor\u00a0to tourism revenue over the next few years.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.<\/p><p>In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.\u00a0 A strong focus on the &quot;culturally curious&quot;, who tend to stay longer and spend more,\u00a0will assist\u00a0Tourism Ireland in their defence of their British market.\u00a0 Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland is currently\u00a0finalising \u00a0its corporate plan for the period from 2017-2019.\u00a0 This plan will,\u00a0<i>inter alia,<\/i>include the agency's response to marketing Ireland in Britain in the new situation that has developed following the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800088#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800088#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[6391\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020800088#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"to outline the degree to which he proposes to deploy the capital sports grants throughout the country to ensure a high quality and standard of facilities in all areas within reason in keeping with demographics and the demands of a growing population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.

Funding of &euro;51m for current expenditure is available from my Department in 2016 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.

This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department has commenced the process with national organisations and local services to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree the 2017 allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.

The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.
