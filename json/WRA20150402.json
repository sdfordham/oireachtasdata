To assist in the overall reform process a Strategic Transformation Office has been established at Garda Headquarters to co-ordinate the implementation of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report. <\/p><p>Notable steps already taken in response to the Report's recommendations include the establishment of Risk Compliance and Continuous Improvement Offices in each Region to ensure the standardisation of processes and to support Regional Garda management in improving the delivery of local policing services and ensuring governance and accountability. In addition, the development of a new Incident Recording Process which addresses the challenges identified in the report is currently being piloted in three Garda Divisions.<\/p><p>Other important measures which are underway include the development of a new accountability framework for crime investigation, incident management and administration,  as well as the introduction of a new IT strategic planning process to oversee the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology.<\/p><p>The Garda commitment to improving the support to victims of crime is highlighted in early developments following on the Inspectorate's recommendations. These include the establishment of Garda Victim Service Offices in each Garda Division on 16th March 2015.In addition, a new Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Human Exploitation Unit has been established and a Chief Superintendent appointed to oversee the new unit under the auspices of National Support Services.  Updates are also being made to PULSE to facilitate better communication with victims.<\/p><p>I should also note that important work is being led by the Central Statistics Office in relation to the recommendations concerning crime statistics. This includes a detailed analysis of PULSE data in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent the recommendations may have implications for the crime statistics which the CSO produces.  The CSO is also chairing an expert panel to examine the Inspectorate's recommendations on crime statistics.<i><\/i>The expert panel will review the crime counting and detection rules, as recommended by the Inspectorate, with a view to introducing new national standards.

Niall Molloy.   The report was published with a number of redactions which were made following  consultation with the Attorney General and in agreement with Mr. McGinn.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge, as I did when publishing the report, that first and foremost this case involves the tragic death of a man much loved by his family and by those in the community. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of concerns raised by the family of Fr Molloy, the SCRT carried out a major review of the case which involved an extensive examination of the original investigation, as well as detailed inquiries into the additional issues raised.  The SCRT report was submitted to the DPP who advised that there be no further prosecution in the case. <\/p>  <p>  While I, as Minister, have no role in the prosecution process I am of course very aware of the claims which have been made about Father Molloy&rsquo;s death over many years.  In an effort to address concerns about this matter, it was decided to appoint Mr. McGinn to independently assess what information could be put into the public domain regarding the case, and to advise as to whether further inquiry would be warranted.  This was an exceptional course of action, motivated by the desire to bring the greatest possible transparency to bear.<\/p>  <p>  The thrust of Mr. McGinn's report has been to shed light on as many issues as possible in order to minimise the number of unanswered questions regarding the case.  The report outlines how some of the concerns expressed about this case are simply not supported by evidence.  It also details shortcomings in the original investigation, which were identified by the SCRT Review.  <\/p>  <p>  While unanswered questions do remain, the report concludes that the precise events surrounding Father Molloy&rsquo;s death cannot now be ascertained.  It concludes that, given the passage of time, the death of many of the pertinent witnesses, and the reluctance of others to give evidence, that it is unlikely any further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.   In these circumstances I have accepted the report's recommendation that examination by a further inquiry would not be warranted.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is not the outcome that Fr Molloy's family have sought but I believe it is the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached following Mr McGinn's careful analysis of the SCRT review.

This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The independent review is ongoing and 318 cases have been referred to the Panel. The volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking longer than originally anticipated, but it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully.  Counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as is reasonably practicable.<\/p>  <p>  The review in each case consists of an examination of the papers by independent counsel, who then make a recommendation as to whether any further action might be taken. I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but with respect I think that is to misunderstand this process. The purpose of the review is to triage the allegations to see if further investigations are needed. To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical.  In view of the fact that it was thought that the review might be completed within three months it was clear that the process did not envisage hearings or interviews.  The fact that it is taking longer is due to the higher number of cases than originally notified, the complexity of some of those cases and the fact that counsel have their other commitments to their clients and the courts.<\/p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur. However I would also make the point again that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process, such as an investigation by GSOC or a court hearing, even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome. The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The Panel has made significant progress and the submission of recommendations to me is being prepared by officials.

This has resulted in the median processing times at first instance increasing from 12 weeks in January 2014 to 21 weeks in January 2015. The median processing time for appeals of refugee status decisions in 2014 was some 49 weeks for appeals involving an oral hearing and 39 weeks in the case of appeals decided on papers only.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is refused refugee status and has applied for subsidiary protection the investigation of this application follows. The Deputy should also be aware that the time taken to process a protection application to finality can be prolonged by the taking of judicial review proceedings against decisions made at various stages of the protection determination process. <\/p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged that the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed particularly in light of the sharp increase in asylum application volumes in 2014 and so far in 2015. The Deputy may be aware that an Independent Working Group was established in October 2014 to recommend to the Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure. <\/p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices. The Working Group is due to report to Government with its recommendations by May 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I have also committed to introducing legislative change in the Protection area to provide for a single application procedure with a view to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the protection process.  On 25 March 2015 I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, which was approved by Government last week. This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 - 2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system.  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for indeterminate periods of time.  The single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and should be granted status and those who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law.  My aim is for the legislation to be enacted by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Working Group on the Protection Process and the future publication of the International Protection Bill, a number of other initiatives have already been put in place to address the number of cases on hand in the protection system which are yielding significant results. Various strategies are being utilised to deal with cases on hand including the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays. The transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013 has resulted in the scheduling of 1,500 interviews so far and the production of decisions in some 1,000 cases at first instance. In addition, a further 1,300 subsidiary protection applications have either been withdrawn or deemed withdrawn. The processing of these cases has been greatly aided by the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work. Based on the success of the use of the panel it is now planned to expand it and extend its remit to include the processing of asylum applications. <\/p>  <p>  To assist with processing at the appeals stage of the process I have recently appointed nine additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. These members have been selected from those who were considered suitable for appointment following a competitive process involving the Public Appointments Service. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200028#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Authority Establishment","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200029#WRB00100"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[13370\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200029#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Garda authority will be fully operational; the amount that has been spent on its establishment to date; the role the authority will have in Garda promotions; the number of staff she envisages it to have; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>The introduction of legislation to provide for a Policing Authority is a key element of the Government's comprehensive programme of justice reform.

to take Questions Nos. 38 to 61, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made in increasing the number of participants on the community employment (CE) drug rehabilitation scheme.  Table 1 shows that in December 2014, there were 936 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places (644 male and 292 female) and 220 support workers (103 male and 117 female).  In total, in December 2014 therefore, there were 1,156 places taken up on CE drug rehabilitation schemes.<\/p><p>This compares to December 2012 when there were 655 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places (407 male and 248 female) and 169 support workers (59 male and 110 female).  In total in December 2012 therefore, there were 824 places taken up on drug rehabilitation schemes.  Overall, there has been an increase of approximately 14% in the number of females (clients and participants) from December 2012 to Dec 2104.<\/p><p>Support worker places are additional to the 1,000 ring-fenced drug rehabilitation places as these participants assist in the delivery of the CE Scheme while at the same time having their own job seeking needs addressed.  These participants must comply with normal CE eligibility conditions and are assigned tasks associated with the work of the projects.<\/p><p>At December 2014, there are 936 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places which is close to full capacity (1,000 places).  The Deputy will appreciate that during any given year, participants may exit for many reasons, including illness\/relapse, gaining employment, maternity leave, retirement, emigration, transfer to another scheme, exit to a training programme or completion of CE.  There is, therefore, a cycle of places becoming vacant and being filled on an on-going basis on CE schemes.<\/p><p>Table 2 and Table 3 show a gender and age breakdown for referred clients in December 2012 and December 2014.  In December 2014, there was an increase in the number of referred clients in all age bands compared to December 2012.<\/p><p>There has been no change in the entry requirements for CE drug rehabilitation schemes.  These places are available only to service users who are in drugs rehabilitation and referred to a place by an addiction service practitioner.  Referral practitioners are Key Workers or Case Managers, Counsellors, GPs, Treatment Centre practitioners, and Health Service practitioners.<\/p><p>A Drugs Stakeholder group chaired by the Department was set up in May 2013 to inform and advise on the delivery of the drugs rehabilitation response within CE.  Membership includes representatives of the community and voluntary sectors, Drugs Task Forces and statutory organisations.  Two workshops have been held for CE Scheme Supervisors and Departmental staff to support and advance the CE drugs response.

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of the adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State.  Revenue has received 141 complaints to date, the majority of which originated in Revenue's Border Midland West Region. <\/p>  <p>  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent for analysis by the State Laboratory.  345 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory.<\/p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples.  Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location.  The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol.  If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating vigorously the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instances where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against alleged offenders where possible.  They have been working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on this matter, and will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that they continue to undertake an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data.  In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible action to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200032#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Legal Cases","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200032#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[13790\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200032#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to discussions between the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and a family (details supplied), the way the interests of the taxpayers will be protected within such discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[13791\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200032#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the implications of the legal proceedings being undertaken by a family (details supplied) in relation to the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; its implications for the distribution of any surplus arising from the liquidation to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Special Liquidators of IBRC are unable to comment on individual cases.

Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy (of 28.6 cents\/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production. It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.  I have, on numerous occasions, proposed action at EU level to mitigate the impact of super levy, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing overall EU production was within quota.   However, given the opposition of a blocking minority of Member States, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. <\/p>  <p>With respect to the impending super levy, there are a number of initiatives which I as Minister have taken to help ensure that the Irish dairy sector enters the post quota era as smoothly as possible. Flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the super-levy fine on a phased basis over 3 years and my Department is working on the details of a scheme to give effect to this flexibility at national level. I hope to be able to announce more details on this in the near future. This announcement will serve as a major boost to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cash flow burden of paying the super-levy bill.   <\/p>  <p>On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. I have also ensured that Priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. In addition, I have impressed upon the Irish banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.   <\/p>  <p>The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. However, it is important that dairy farmers plan prudently for this new era.

This  includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support frontline Garda&iacute; and intelligence led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the  Commissioner as provided for under Section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 January, 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 12,763. There are also 1,100 Garda Reserves and 2,000 Civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I was very pleased that my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to the resumption of Garda recruitment.  Last September, 100 new Garda recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore, the first intake of Garda recruits since May 2009. This was followed by an intake of a further 100 recruits in December and a third intake of 100 in January of this year.  The first of these intakes will attest as sworn members of the Force in May of this year with the additional recruits attesting in September and October.  In addition, I have received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for two further intakes of 125 Garda recruits later this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity and terrorism.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, scheduled to become operational shortly, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured a further &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet of which &euro;7 million was made available in 2014. This funding brings the total investment in the Garda fleet in 2014 to &euro;11 million. The remaining &euro;3 million is being made available for the purchase and fit out of additional Garda vehicles in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In October, 2014, an order was placed for 370 new vehicles. These vehicles were delivered towards the end of 2014, and following fit out, are being allocated in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's operational requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I have also clearly signalled my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address deficits which were identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for additional resources across a number of areas will be examined within that context.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has commenced an in-depth examination of all recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report with a view to determining what can be  implemented in the short, medium and long term.  I also look forward to the significant contribution to this process of reform that will be made by the new policing authority which is to be established shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organised Crime","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM01300"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[13800\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which best Irish or international practice continues to be applied to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle effectively the activities of Irish criminal gangs, or those outside this jurisdiction, controlling criminal activities here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the operation of organised crime groups is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that tackling these groups remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In this regard the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Within this framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle local crime issues including public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce crime and enhance community safety. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour and related criminality. I am advised that there is a community policing team in each Garda District.<\/p>  <p>  Particular developments in recent years include, the national &lsquo;Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo; which reaffirms the community policing ethos through the hosting of various local activities and as part of which Garda&iacute; give important Crime Prevention and Road Safety Advice. In addition, Garda Community Crime Prevention Guidelines, which build on the work of existing partnership programmes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, were published in January 2013. The guidelines give information and advice to help establish new community &ldquo;watch&rdquo; groups and also to revitalise existing groups where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Garda Text Alert Scheme was launched in September 2013 and it provides a further mechanism for Garda&iacute; to provide crime prevention information to community contacts who in turn forward the information to all members of a community groups. This initiative has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 600 local groups involving in excess of 120,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice 1984 as amended by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive but if imposed in the District Court the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed two years.<\/p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at an advanced stage in my Department.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences are committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I am taking the opportunity in this legislation to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the CSO to forward relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[13803\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200037#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which free legal aid remains available, in respect of criminal cases, to those who have re-offended while on bail; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.

An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.

Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure. <\/p>  <p>  Huge improvements have been made in prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to reducing overcrowding in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is intended to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,982 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. An examination of the figures on 30 March 2015 when there were 3,748 prisoners in custody shows that this figure was 94% of the Inspector's recommended total of 3,982.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 or less is being considered. <\/p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering an unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prison on short sentences. <\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service. 1,216 prisoners have taken part in the Community Return Programme since October 2011, and 909 have completed the programme. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to Community Return, the Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release. At present there are 70 persons on temporary release with over 220 prisoners released onto this Scheme having successfully completed their sentences. <\/p>  <p>  All this points to a reducing trend in prisoner numbers indicative of the progress being made by this Government to reduce the prisoner population and pursue alternatives to custody. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200038#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200038#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[13807\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200038#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which resources remain available to her Department for the pursuit of so-called cold cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the function of the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) is to assist Senior Investigating Officers assigned to the case in question in bringing investigations to a successful conclusion by identifying further investigative opportunities and ensuring that investigations conform to approved best practice guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  At the conclusion of each review a substantive report is provided to the Senior Investigating Officer who considers the opportunities for further investigation for dissemination back into the investigative and operational units.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  <\/p>  <p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on FETAC accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison. <\/p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<\/p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.   Work Training Officers have recently been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.

More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12.2 million people in need of immediate life-saving support within Syria. Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries. In December, the UN launched humanitarian appeals for US$8.4 billion to help nearly 18 million people in Syria and the region in 2015.  This was the largest UN appeal in history.<\/p><p>This week, I attended the major humanitarian pledging conference for Syria which was chaired by UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon and hosted by the Government of Kuwait. The aim of the Conference was to mobilise the required financial resources to enable the UN and its partners to meet urgent humanitarian needs, and to harness solidarity among concerned nations for the plight of the Syrian people. <\/p><p>I made a significant pledge of &euro;12 million on behalf of the Irish Government to provide Irish Aid funding and emergency supplies to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the Syria conflict in 2015.<i><\/i>This contribution will bring the total value of the Irish Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis in Syria to over &euro;41 million. Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Our aid will be delivered through UN partners, the Red Cross and NGOs and will support people displaced within Syria and those across the wider region.  One of the most difficult features of this crisis is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian workers, with vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly being particularly affected.  It is disappointing that cross-border access has actually diminished over the last year. Ireland continues to advocate strongly for the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on humanitarian access in Syria. The EU has been the largest single donor in response to the crisis. At the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council, in which my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Charlie Flanagan, T.D., participated, a strategy was adopted outlining how the EU and its Member States are planning to counter the threat posed by ISIL and help restore peace and security in Syria and Iraq.<\/p><p>At the Pledging Conference in Kuwait, I called on all parties to the conflict to work towards a political solution to the conflict, and highlighted the plight of Syrian refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.

He also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.<\/p><p>The Association responded positively to his  approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. <\/p><p>The publishers have also given assurances  that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.<\/p><p>My Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding was provided in 2013 and 2014. <\/p><p>It will continue to be paid in 2015.<\/p><p>Budget 2014 provided funding of &euro;5 million for three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that did not operate such schemes.

Every primary school has now been given the opportunity to benefit from the funding secured for the School Book Rental Scheme.<\/p><p>The previous Minister also launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January 2013. These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes. Schools which already have book rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.<\/p><p>A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. <\/p><p>Educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department. <\/p><p>One estimate from publishers' sources suggests that the Irish school book market is worth approximately &euro;60million per annum.<\/p><p>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes. Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme. In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on other businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs.  As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers.     <\/p>  <p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Donegal County Council has already introduced, for 2015, a Small Business Grant Scheme under which businesses can avail of a 5% reduction on their rates bill (subject to a maximum reduction of &euro;250) if their rates are paid in full before the end of the year and there are no arrears on their account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200049#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Septic Tank Grants","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200050#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[13753\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200050#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if it is possible to combine the grant for septic tanks with the grant for group sewerage schemes, where septic tanks have failed inspections and where they are close to the current foul main, but where the current grant under the group sewerage scheme is insufficient to make the project viable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":607,"content":"<p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of individual septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA's National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.

The report concluded that the Irish ELV system is not performing to the optimum level and outlined the need for comprehensive structural change. The key recommendations of the report included: The establishment of a compliance scheme for the ELV PRI, and an increased enforcement focus by local authorities on unauthorised ELV sites.<\/p>  <p>  The report also contained several further recommendations concerning technical aspects of the current system, simplification of reporting requirements and enhanced enforcement and awareness raising measures.<\/p>  <p>  An ELV Working Group was established in June 2014 comprising industry, local authorities and other regulatory bodies to assist my Department in implementing the recommendations of the report. Arising from the Group's work, a compliance scheme for the sector, End-of-Life Vehicle Environmental Services (ELVES) Ltd., has recently been established, comprising &ldquo;producers&rdquo; in the sector. As recommended in the ELV report, local authorities and the compliance scheme should collaborate to improve the identification of non-compliant businesses.

A core objective in so doing is to bring a greater consistency of approach to the application of waste legislation and its enforcement at local, regional and national levels. To this end, my Department has recommended the establishment of a lead enforcement authority in each of the three waste management planning regions. Each of these new Lead Regional Waste Enforcement Authorities would have responsibility for co-ordinating waste enforcement actions within regions, setting priorities and common objectives, ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation across the three regions, while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground to address specific breaches of waste legislation. These proposals are currently being considered with a view to an enhanced system of waste enforcement being introduced later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of these lead enforcement authorities will allow for co-ordinated, specific action on particular waste streams such as ELVs.<\/p>  <p>  The enforcement of road traffic legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200050#WRZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[13857\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason the allocation of Leader funding to the County Cork region is 70% less than the previous round of funding; his views that this is fair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[13858\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the average of the national allocation of Leader funding County Cork received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[13859\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the rationale of using and allocating funding to a sub regional area; the extra areas that received funding under this category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[13860\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the way the criteria of sub regional areas were applied to the County Cork area, in view of the fact it has twice the population living in the county compared to its city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 251, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>I refer to the reply to Question Nos. 617, 618, 620, 632, 633 and 635 on 31 March 2015 which sets out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[13627\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040200051#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to improve the broadband service, as per the national broadband plan, in an area (details supplied) in County Galway; if he will ensure businesses have access to high speed broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

The first such EU Regulation commenced in 2007, followed by amending Regulations adopted in 2010 and 2012 to further reduce the maximum permitted wholesale and retail roaming charges within the EU. The Regulations also introduced measures to protect users from bill shocks when roaming.    Ireland supported each of the EU Roaming Regulations which the EU Commission calculates have achieved regulated retail roaming price reductions of over 80% since 2007 in calls, SMS and data. These reductions have benefitted all roaming mobile phone users without adverse impacts on users who do not use roaming services. This was achieved by reducing both wholesale and retail prices simultaneously.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, the European Commission introduced a wide range of proposed measures, including changes to current roaming regulations, as part of a comprehensive Telecoms Single Market (TSM) package. In early 2014, the then out-going European Parliament, having discussed the TSM proposal, voted to significantly amend the Commission's proposals on roaming.

The draft strategy found that there remains a clear need for the North South transmission Line, and that the existing proposal for a 400kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project.
