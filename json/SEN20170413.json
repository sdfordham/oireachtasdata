The national training levy is crucial source of revenue in the context of the ongoing national debate on the funding of third level education.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the Cassells report released last year has painted a bleak picture of the state of our higher education sector.  The report has made it clear that we must act decisively to save a third level education sector which is in serious financial trouble.  I firmly believe that the national training levy must play a central role in our response to this crisis.<\/p> <p>The report correctly identified employers as major stakeholders in and major beneficiaries from higher education.  Our highly educated workforce is a major structural advantage for Irish businesses and enterprise, and it is logical that they would contribute towards its funding.  I welcome the public consultation process currently under way in the Department of Education and Skills on a proposal for an increase in the levy from 0.7% to 1% and strongly support such an increase. <\/p> <p>I note that the consultation process is specifically framed with the intention of responding to the Cassells report and the challenges facing the higher education sector which include funding issues such as the poor spend compared with other OECD states and the lower spend in comparison with primary and secondary education, but also the STEM skills gap and the growing demographic of students expected to attend higher education, with a 27% increase expected by 2028.<\/p> <p>It is welcome that the Department is aware of and preparing for these issues.  However, since the Government recognises that the national training levy will be a key part of our response to the third level funding crisis, it is crucial for us to understand the administration of the revenue generated by the levy since its introduction in 2000.  How much has been allocated for expenditure?  Where has the money been spent?  What money has not been spent and why?  How are such decisions made?  What does the Government plan to do with the increased revenue?  It is important for us to properly examine the record of the levy and the national training fund.  We need to ensure the fund is fit for purpose and is being managed well for the benefit of citizens.<\/p> <p>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  How will the additional income generated by an increased levy be distributed?  None of us wants Irish businesses to play a direct role in higher education policy and decision making, and demanding that their skills gaps be prioritised above other important factors.  Given that we need the arts and other such subjects to be supported just as much as STEM projects, how will this be managed?<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State consider investing the increased revenue in capital infrastructure in higher education institutions, as universities are not ready to respond to changing demographics or opportunities that may arise as a result of Brexit?  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that this funding will come as an additional resource for the higher education sector and is not used as a replacement for the loss of any existing revenue streams?<\/p> <p>I note that section 2.4 of the legislation provides that the Minister shall manage and control the investment account of the fund.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Can the Minister comment on what investment return the fund has achieved in the last five years?

The levy is collected through the pay as you earn, PAYE, and pay related social insurance, PRSI, system and funds are transferred monthly to my Department.  Funding from the NTF is allocated by me, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in accordance with the provisions of the National Training Fund Act 2000.  While the NTF does not form part of the Vote of my Department, the allocation for each scheme is determined as part of the annual Estimates process.  The NTF is included as an annex to the published Estimates of the Department and such funding has been included in the overall expenditure ceiling for my Department since 2011.<\/p> <p>Prior to 2012 income from the NTF levy had fallen from a high of &euro;413 million in 2008 to &euro;299 million.  However, since 2012, receipts from the NTF levy have increased annually, due to improved employment levels.  The NTF levy generated &euro;299 million in 2012, &euro;317 million in 2013, &euro;338 million in 2014, &euro;364 million in 2015 and &euro;390 million in 2016.  It should be noted that the operation of the EU fiscal rules and the inclusion of the NTF in the Department of Education and Skills overall annual expenditure ceiling mean that, in the absence of an increased rate of contribution, additional expenditure cannot be sourced from the NTF without a corresponding drop in Exchequer expenditure.<\/p> <p>The accumulated surplus in the fund has been critical in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed, in the years when receipts fell below the expenditure levels required.  It is considered prudent to continue to maintain an adequate surplus in the fund to meet demand in future years and it should be noted that, while the current surplus of &euro;232 million represents a very significant sum, it would only cover seven months of NTF expenditure at current levels.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skills needs.<\/p> <p>NTF funding is used to raise the skills of those in employment, to provide training to those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment and to provide information relating to existing or future requirements for skills in the economy.  The majority of the funding is expended under the broad headings of training for employment and training in employment.  Training for employment provides a range of training programmes for jobseekers, including training for early school leavers and for people with disabilities and targeted skills programmes such as Springboard and ICT skills conversion.  Training in employment funding supports the training of employed people, primarily the apprenticeship programme and employer-led and contracted training through the Skillnets model.<\/p> <p>There has been a shift recently in the focus of investment with more funding allocated to training those in employment and less allocated to training jobseekers, due to the upturn in our economy and growing numbers of people in employment.  In 2017, I am providing funding of &euro;366 million from the NTF.  As part of this allocation, I have provided an additional &euro;24 million to training those in employment to meet demand which will arise mainly in the expansion of apprenticeship opportunities.  I am also reviewing the allocation of funding to programmes in the further education and training and higher education sectors as between NTF and Exchequer sources in terms both of the appropriate emphasis required on training for employment and training persons in employment and of satisfying the needs of enterprise to meet strategic skills requirements.<\/p> <p>I hope I have answered the Senator's questions.  There is a consultation process and she is more than welcome to contribute to that.  I would appreciate her contribution.  If I have omitted to mention anything, I will get that information from the Department.

I am calling on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to introduce new wind energy development guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker as a matter of urgency.  It is more than three years since the closing date for submissions under the public call for submissions on the proposed revision of the 2006 wind energy guidelines, but we are still no closer to the new guidelines being introduced.<\/p> <p>The guidelines were first introduced in 1996 and they were revised in 2006.  In the intervening years, the size and scale of wind turbines and industrial wind farms have increased dramatically.  Where turbines were approximately 90 metres in height, many are now 170 metres to 200 metres in height.  While we wait for new wind energy development guidelines to be introduced rural communities such as mine are sitting ducks for the highly subsidised wind energy industry.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was highlighted that interest had been conveyed to timber companies about the development of a wind energy farm near to where I live in Castlecoote.  The Minister needs to do two things.  The subsidy for onshore wind energy is far too high.  The industry is subsidised but it has created great difficulties for families and residents, particularly in the Slieve Bawn area.  Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na built a wind farm in the Roscommon-Strokestown-Ballyleague area but it has caused major difficulties for the residents.  The Minister must introduce new wind energy guidelines where the setback is ten times the height of the wind turbine.  For example, a 150 m turbine would be setback 1,500 m or 1.5 km from residents.  The most critical things for consideration are the potential impact the noise generated will have on residents in close proximity, the associated effects on sleep and subsequent health, the potential for shadow flicker on residential homes, the overall impact on the landscape, the general amenity of the residents and the loss of tourism and economic benefits.<\/p><p>Coillte is the national company that organises and runs the timber industry.  I am concerned by the fact Coillte has been approached by a German company with a proposal to develop wind turbines in my area.  The German company is only interested in erecting wind turbines in the area.  The project would have a detrimental effect on the communities in the area - for instance, Aghagad, Aghagower, Bracklin, Carrowkeel, Cornaveagh, Creemully, Aghagad Beg and Derryhippo, County Roscommon.  A major project has been put forward by the local action group.  It has met practically every week over the past number of weeks in order to put forward a very good policy decision or request to Coillte, which I hope will be considered in the very near future.  I call on Coillte to desist from dealing with the wind farm proposal for the area.  I also ask the Minister to introduce guidelines as quickly as possible.  The guidelines are a number of years out of date.  I look forward to the Minister responding in a positive manner with new planning guidelines for wind turbines that will be erected in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#B00900","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The Senator has finished spot on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#C00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#C00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#C00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

The Minister recognises the need to bring the review to a close in order to give certainty to all stakeholders, local authorities, the energy sector and the wider community.<\/p> <p>In light of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to finalise the guidelines and the ongoing policy and legal developments in this area, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is continuing to advance work on the guidelines and related matters in order to bring the various issues to a conclusion as early as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, expects to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks when he will outline the proposed revisions to the guidelines and the timelines for implementation of the various elements.<\/p> <p>As part of the overall review, and having regard to a recent European Court of Justice judgment on the Belgian-Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is proposed to undertake a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, of the proposed revisions to the 2006 guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes that act as frameworks for development consent prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  In light of the SEA requirement, which will take approximately nine months, it is likely that while the proposals for revisions to the guidelines will be available shortly the guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until the end of the year.  When finalised, the revised guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the guidelines issued under section 28 in their assessment of planning applications and in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.<\/p> <p>In the interim, the 2006 guidelines will continue to apply to existing planning applications that are with either the local planning authorities or the board for determination.  As mentioned earlier, there has been close engagement between both Ministers and their Departments with a view to advancing the revision of the guidelines to a conclusion.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, recently had a constructive meeting with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his officials.  Both Ministers will further discuss the matter today.  In light of the recent progress made on the matter, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is confident that he will be able to make an announcement on the final proposed revisions to the guidelines which will be subject to the SEA process in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#C00500","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It is encouraging that the Minister is moving in this particular regard.

In Donegal as many as 700 adults and children have type 1 diabetes and 6,000 adults and children have type 2 diabetes.  We need a team of endocrinologists and nurse specialists who can deal with children and adults.  We need a centre of excellence in the north-west region of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  The nearest centre of excellence for diabetes care is in Limerick and the paediatric endocrinologist at Sligo University Hospital has left her position to work in the centre of excellence in Limerick.  The Minister has known about this matter since January.  The position has been advertised and God knows how long it will take to fill the post.  There is no commitment to provide cover, which is the vital issue from a Donegal perspective, in the clinics for children.  There are 161 children with type 1 diabetes who rely on the monthly clinics for pump therapy.  The pump therapy is the accepted way to deal with diabetes care and prevent long-term issues.  Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition and these children must live with it.  We urgently need reassurance that the monthly clinics will continue and that the post will be filled.<\/p> <p>The Donegal Diabetes Association has also made it clear that we need to double the number of endocrinologists and specialists at Letterkenny University Hospital.

I will relay the Senator's concerns about the failure on occasion of Ministers to appear in the Chamber to deal with Commencement matters.<\/p> <p>A paediatric insulin pump service was initiated in May 2015.  The service is based in Sligo University Hospital, with outreach clinics in Letterkenny University Hospital.  The Saolta University Healthcare Group has confirmed that the consultant paediatrician with specialty interest in diabetes who was instrumental in commencing the service is leaving the post in mid-April.  It has recently advised the Department that a consultant paediatrician has been appointed to the post on a temporary basis.  The permanent post is to be filled through public competition via the Public Appointments Service and this process is ongoing.<\/p> <p>To address the issue of continuity, the clinical service arrangements for the management of the insulin pump service are being examined in consultation with the relevant clinical teams.  There is one consultant endocrinologist at Letterkenny University Hospital providing the adult diabetes service which serves approximately 700 patients with type 1 diabetes and 6,500 patients with type 2 diabetes.  The consultant endocrinologist is receiving support from a locum consultant general physician who has a diabetic interest.  Additional clinics are being run on a monthly basis, with one or two extra clinics per month, to address waiting lists for the service.<\/p> <p>The major focus in the past 12 months has been on seeing newly referred patients.  The overall waiting list for no patients to be seen by the consultant endocrinologist has been reduced by 20% from 313 patients in 2015 to 249 patients at present.  More significantly, the number of new referrals waiting for more than one year for a clinic appointment has been reduced by 80% from 97 in 2015 to 19 at present.<\/p> <p>With regard to addressing waiting times for patients who require repeat appointments, work is continuing with the diabetic service to address this pressure, while simultaneously ensuring newly referred patients are seen promptly.  The Saolta group advises that an adult insulin pump therapy service is provided for patients in the north west.  The current number of adult pump therapy  patients is 24.  However, eight additional patients are transitioning to the adult service, while a further eight will move to the service in three to six months, bringing the number of adult pump patients to 40.<\/p> <p>On the future of diabetes services in the north west, the Saolta group advises that a business case is being prepared in support of a second consultant endocrinologist, a diabetic nurse specialist and a diabetic dietician to further support the Lettekenny diabetes service.  On the recruitment of health care workers generally, significant efforts are ongoing at national and local level to address staffing issues across the health service.  It should be noted that the numbers of consultants increased by more than 130 between February 2016 and February 2017, while numbers of nurses and non-consultant hospital doctors increased by approximately 460 and 230 whole-time equivalents, respectively, in the same timeframe.<\/p> <p>I note the Senator's dissatisfaction about the Minister's absence.  I will convey to the Minister the various issues raised, in particular, the Senator's view that the Minister should be present in the Chamber.

This is a serious issue, given that it has been well documented that diabetes care will prevent long-term interventions such as amputations and long-term conditions such as loss of sight.  The paediatrician endocrinologist at Sligo University Hospital has moved to the centre of excellence in Limerick.  The failure to deliver a centre of excellence in counties Donegal and Sligo, as justified by the numbers involved, has resulted in the needless loss of top class professionals to another centre of excellence.  I reiterate my request that the Minister meet representatives of the Donegal Diabetes Association as soon as possible to assure them that the monthly clinics for their children which offer pump therapy essential to their care will not be lost.

It is good to have the correct Minister of State in the House.  It is not the case that Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn was shooting the messenger because this issue affects all Senators.<\/p> <p>The issue I raise is the care of children outside the State.  A small number of children need special care which cannot be provided here and are sent abroad to avail of a broader range of treatment options, supports and interventions.  In the past two years six children were sent abroad for this reason.  However, records are not held for other years.  Data must be collected nationally for future reference and use.  Of the six children sent abroad, three were sent to the St. Andrew's facility in Northampton in England.  I do not know where the other three were sent, but perhaps the Minister of State might provide that information.  The lack of facilities for children who require them means that some children are sent abroad where they do not have access to family, friends and someone who will fight their corner.  These disturbed and vulnerable children do not have a voice abroad and are in a dire position.  The cost of placing three children in facilities abroad for one year is &euro;1 million. <\/p> <p>A few weeks ago Channel 4 broadcast a \"Dispatches\" documentary, \"Under Lock and Key\", which painted a damning picture of disgraceful conditions at the St. Andrew's facility.  It found that children were held in an institution that did not meet their needs, make them better or keep them safe.  The facility is operated by one of the largest and wealthiest health care charities in Britain.  Serious concerns arising from the \"Dispatches\" programme include that patients were subject to restraint, seclusion and frequent sedation.  An inspection by the Quality Care Commission, the British equivalent of the Health Information and Quality Authority in this jurisdiction, noted the use of a technique known as prone restraint.  This face-down method of restraining a person, with which I am familiar, is widely used across all wards in the St. Andrew's facility which caters for young children aged between 11 and 18 years.  The use of prone restraint has been banned here because it compromises respiratory function and has caused deaths in the past.  If someone sits on a person and restrains him or her in a prone position, it cuts off his or her airways.<\/p> <p>In a six-month period between 2015 and 2016 prone restraint was used 600 times in child and adolescent wards.  One 15 year old patient remained mainly in segregation for 22 months in a room with very little natural daylight.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Four patients died within seven months of each other in one ward between October 2010 and May 2010.

I know a programme such as the \"Dispatches\" programme can be very upsetting, particularly for someone with a child with a mental health problem or disability, and even more so for a parent whose child is there.  As the Senator said, three young people with mental health problems have been sent over there.  I am sure people in Tusla and the disability sector are speaking to the HSE officials who, I know, are over and back quite frequently.  They were over in October before the new facility was occupied.  They have been over since then and have assured me they have not found any issues with the three young people currently over there.  However, it is extremely important we are not complacent and that we ensure the checks and balances we have are up to the highest standard possible.<\/p> <p>The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of mental health services are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion.  However, on occasion as we know, the presenting clinical need of children is such that current service provision is not in place to address identified need here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Child and adolescent mental health services fall within the secondary and tertiary levels of care provision, based on the increasing severity of the mental health need.  Tertiary services provide specialist mental health services for those children and adolescents who have complex and severe mental health problems or who are at high risk of harm.  It also includes those with an eating disorder.<\/p> <p>The four HSE CAMHS units operate as a national network of inpatient care.  Each has a regional remit and co-operates with other units to ensure optimal utilisation of available bed resources.  I know we have a difficulty in recruiting staff at the moment which, of course, has a knock-on effect on the ability to use all our beds.  We are trying to deal with that.<\/p> <p>There is a small group with particularly complex needs who may require a level of specialised intervention not available in Ireland.  In such cases, a child or young person may be placed in out-of-State care at a facility abroad, which offers a wider range of treatment options or interventions than those provided in Irish facilities.  In such cases, priority is always given to the care of the young person's needs, and placements are made in the best interests of the child.<\/p> <p>The HSE operates a treatment abroad scheme for people entitled to treatment, along with associated costs, in another EU state.  The scheme is governed by EU regulation, and in accordance with Department of Health guidelines.<\/p> <p>The scheme allows a consultant, based in Ireland, to refer a patient normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets various relevant criteria as follows.  Following clinical assessment, medical evidence must be provided by the referring hospital consultant, giving details of the patient's medical condition, the type of treatment envisaged and the proposed provider of the treatment abroad.  The referring consultant, having reviewed the patient in the immediate previous two weeks, must certify that they recommend treatment in another EU or EEA country.  The treatment must be medically necessary and meet the patient's needs.  The treatment must be a proven form of medical treatment and not be experimental or test treatment.  Care must be in a recognised hospital or other institution and under the control of a registered medical practitioner.  The treatment must not be available in Ireland or otherwise not available within the timeframe normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the young person's current state of health and the probable course of the medical condition.<\/p> <p>The HSE keeps the needs of young people with mental health issues of greater severity under review, where the treatment abroad is considered necessary and in the young person's interests.<\/p> <p>The process of finalising the design brief for the national paediatric hospital is near completion.  This will include a 20-bed CAMHS inpatient unit, incorporating an eight-bed specialist eating disorder service.  We know the reason that many of our young people are sent abroad is to deal with eating disorders.  The provision of a ten-bed adolescent secure unit is part of the planned redevelopment of the national forensic services at Portrane.  We hope the contracts will be signed in coming weeks so that we can get moving on that.  Such additional service initiatives should assist in providing services not currently available.<\/p> <p>Children with difficult life experiences and mental health difficulties require the highest possible standard of multi-agency supports to address specific needs.  The HSE is committed to working to ensure this is attained.  It is also committed to ensuring that those children who are on the island of Ireland receive the same level of care as those here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#E00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>That was a very thorough response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#E00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

It is highly unlikely that the deal will be concluded within two years and, on that basis, Irish farming and the agrifood sector are very vulnerable given the figures quoted.

This is a most disturbing case.  The children were aged nine,  six and 21 months old at the time social services took them away.  Since then, she has done everything she can to try to get her children back.  What is really disturbing is the fact that the family court system in Britain operates a system of forced adoption.  It is the only country in the EU to operate such a system, although of course it is leaving the EU now.  The court decided that because it would take Elizabeth a year or more to learn how to read or write, it would be too long for the baby to be fostered, so her now two year old baby son has been put into forced adoption.  In other words, she was told she would never see her child again.<\/p> <p>This case is not a one off.  I have been researching this policy of contested or forced adoption, and I find it particularly disturbing because the system operates in secret.  A number of Irish citizens have been affected by the system.  My colleague in Tipperary, Councillor Catherine Carey, has been approached by a number of people in recent times to tell her stories of mothers who, because they suffer from a mild disability, again, because they cannot read or write, have had their children taken away from them and told they will not see them again.<\/p> <p>We began the week speaking about Tuam and a very disturbing situation there and the horrors inflicted on women.  I find it absolutely shocking that today, just across the water, there is a system of contested or forced adoption, which seems to be picking on vulnerable people in particular.  Elizabeth's heart is absolutely broken, but it gets worse.  Given that the system in Britain operates in secret, once a child is forcibly adopted, if one speaks out, one can be jailed.  Elizabeth is being threatened with jail by the British court system at present.  It is not just a threat because at present 200 parents of children are in jail in Britain because they have spoken out about the fact that their children have been taken from them.<\/p> <p>Let us be clear: I fully understand the State has to be responsible and must intervene at times to protect children.  We all agree on this point.  However, it is particularly disturbing to find that parents are effectively gagged, threatened and jailed if they have the temerity to say their sons or daughters have been taken from them and they have been told they will never see them again.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to address urgently the specific issue relating to Elizabeth Crumlish Doran, and to come to the House to discuss this issue because it affects thousands of citizens.  It has been addressed by the Council of Europe, which has expressed concern.  The European Parliament has also expressed particular concern and the Italian courts have expressed concern that it may be in breach of the UN Convention on Human Rights with regard to children.  I ask for the full support of the Leader on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#H00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of the child care subsidy.

It probably does not seem like much to some, but &euro;48 per month for child care for some families, who would have already begun to consider it part of their budget from September, is a massive deal.  The articles I have read today point out it was down to the new computer system.  We should get answers.  For the past number of years, we have been updating and installing new computer systems for the public service card.  I thought there would be some crossover in terms of being able to administer the child care subsidy through the administration put in place for the public service card.

My father grew up in a one-bedroom tenement in poverty on Usher's Quay, and places such as here and Trinity College were so out of bounds for someone growing up in that situation that he never got to walk through the gates of Leinster House.  He taught me two things about politics.  One of these was the importance of voting.  He never explained why it was important, and I am not sure he had the language for it, but he made sure we all marched up to the booth every time there was an election and he always took time off work to vote.  This was as far as he got at explaining why it was important..  Obviously, I learned over time why it is so important for people to exercise their democratic right.  The other thing he taught me, at which I have failed miserably, is not to talk about politics in the pub.  I wish to remember him today, and the fact he never experienced this building, but I am here today, I hope after taking his lead with regard to exercising my democratic right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#H00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I am sure he would be very proud of the Senator, and the advice he gave her was very wise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#H00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Too often we do not acknowledge the progress we have made over the past six years.

This is despite issues with regard to bogus self-employed people, precarious employment and low-cost hours.  Overall, huge strides have been made in getting people back to work.  I was always very conscious of one particular group, who were in their 40s when the recession hit.  They have probably experienced two, three or four years of unemployment.  If they were late 40s when the recession hit, they are now in their early 50s and mid 50s.

The budget in JobsPlus is underspent for this year.  There is a possibility we could develop a specific targeted mechanism through JobsPlus for this particular age group, which has many challenges.  There is automatic discrimination by many employers against people because of their age.  Young men or women in their 30s or 40s do not necessarily want to employ somebody older than them, often with much more experience than them, as they can feel threatened.  We have an obligation to look at this group of people and to see what we can do and how we can assist them to get back into employment and bring forward particularly targeted measures.  There is also a subgroup who received no benefit and so are excluded from any of the back to work programmes because the qualifying criteria mean they must be in receipt of a benefit from the State to access them.

It is a very comprehensive document and on an initial perusal it points to many of the successes, obviously, but also the shortcomings and the glaring weaknesses of some of the governing bodies.  Anyone reading through it would wonder why it has taken until now to sort out some of the issues but that is the situation.  I ask the Leader to arrange that the Minister responsible for sport come to the House.  There is a little confusion over whether that is the Minister, Deputy Ross, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, but that is for the Leader to sort out.  There are many inquiries into the ticket issue and the Olympics and so on but that should not prevent debate and action and corrective measures being put in place.  It would be good to have the discussion.  There is nothing that can lift a nation like sport can, whether at national or international level.

It is important the Minister comes to the House to outline his plans and what additional services he plans to install in the post office network to ensure that network has a sustainable future.  It is another symptom of the decline of rural Ireland, of which, unfortunately, there are many.

The reason I am concerned about this is that it was the case that the former Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, and I, together in our respective Departments in the period 2002-2007, instituted major reforms in personal injuries law and insurance law, including the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  There was a general downward movement in insurance premiums at that time.  Even though the economy of the country was probably overheating, the level of insurance premiums noticeably went down.  Since the downturn in the economy it is strange to see that insurance premiums have been climbing back up again.  There must be a number of reasons for this but it cannot just be a matter that there are more cars on the road or there are more people at work.  The number of premiums being exacted by insurers from employers and people who depend on insurance for their livelihood has gone up very substantially.<\/p> <p>The plight of taxi drivers deserves particular mention.  They are being driven off the ranks and out of business in the city of Dublin, with some finding that their premiums have gone up from, say, &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400 monthly to &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, depending on whether they have had to make a claim of any kind.  Some have been forced to retire because of the burden of insurance.<\/p> <p>I am aware the Government has asked the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, to consider the whole question of personal injuries awards.  It is strange that although newspapers often report on fraudulent claims where, for instance, someone might have got into a car which might have been rammed by another car, and there are patterns of this in different locations around the country, I am not aware that there has been any effective Garda prosecution of those involved.  Given that during early 2000, making a false claim became a criminal offence, the law needs to be enforced.  Most of all, we need a genuine Government response to the rise in the cost of insurance and frequency of claims and the rise in fraudulent claims so that the progress that was made between 2002 and 2007 can be reinstated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#J00600","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Is the Senator minded to second the earlier proposal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#J00700","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Yes, I second Senator Craughwell's proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#J00800","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I was unsure whether the Senator was anxious to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#J00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#J01000","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I rise to speak about the flood relief scheme in Bandon.

As late as yesterday, the farmers representative bodies met with departmental officials as to how the money will be paid out in compensation.

These counties have a significant older population.  I believe that Government action is required to address this issue or these regions were be left further behind.  In County Mayo, where I am from, I can safely say that the young people are leaving the country and are migrating to the cities.  The young people who are leaving are putting more pressure on housing and on school places in the big urban centres.  People cannot live on fresh air.

The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee, is dealing with it.  It would be appropriate to have a debate in the House on the matter and how we can develop a comprehensive policy for the country on home care.  As I have said on previous occasions, the changing demographics of the country mean the nursing home sector will not be able to accommodate the growth in the numbers who require care.  We will have to set up proper support mechanisms.  It would be appropriate to have a debate here before the document is finalised because many Members have experience in the area and could make useful contributions.<\/p> <p>I raise also the issue of dementia.  Private nursing homes are finding it difficult to get the necessary support from the HSE in regard to taking in dementia patients.  Community hospitals cost approximately &euro;1,700 per week per patient whereas it is approximately &euro;1,000 in the private sector.  Private nursing homes are not getting the necessary supports for patients with dementia as they need a higher level of care.  It is a matter we need to debate because there are many people who would like to get a parent or relative into a nursing home near where they live but cannot because there is a lack of availability of beds in their local community hospitals.

Senator Horkan raised the very important issue of Brexit and, in particular, the farming community.  It is important to recognise that in 2016 agrifood exports to the UK amounted to &euro;4.8 billion, or 39% of total agrifood exports.  That is something that is not necessarily communicated and it may be lost.  On the other hand is the issue that agrifood imports from the UK to Ireland came to &euro;3.7 billion, or 46% of total agrifood imports, which is also important.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, has been very proactive on this matter and I commend Senators Paul Daly and Tim Lombard who have raised the issue of the farming community in the context of Brexit on a regular basis.  Just this week, the Minister engaged in the Brexit consultative stakeholder committee which is providing a platform within the Department and the wider agriculture community to raise matters. A dedicated Brexit unit has been established in the Department and additional resources have been provided to Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which are interacting with Enterprise Ireland.  A &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme was launched in January.  Along with agritaxation measures and increased rural development funding, all of these measures are aimed to Brexit-proof the farming community.<\/p> <p>It is important to build on the civic dialogue which took place on 15 December last.  The Minister held two further events in February and has been proactive and engaged at EU level and across the Continent.  These are matters on which the Brexit committee of the Seanad must keep a very vigilant eye as we must not allow any dent to appear in our agricultural community.  As Senator Paul Daly said in his contribution, the inclement weather last year caused havoc for cereal farmers.  We must be very careful and vigilant in regard to the farming community.<\/p> <p>The child and adolescent figures from CAMHS were mentioned.  It is disappointing that the figures are as they are.  Notwithstanding that, the Government has included in the last allocation for the HSE service plan increased funding from &euro;826 million in 2016 to &euro;851 million this year.  It is acknowledged that further development is required under the HSE service plan.  There is a detailed need to make child and adolescent mental health services a strategic priority and to create a focused, targeted incentivisation scheme of recruitment to address the inevitable rise in young adolescents who require services.  All Members recognise from their own constituencies and communities that this is an issue which is not going away and which requires targeted funding.<\/p> <p>Bus &Eacute;ireann was raised as an issue.  I join the Senator in hoping that the Labour Court will resolve the dispute today.  As I said yesterday, I hope the dispute will be resolved.  It is having a profound impact on bus drivers, their families and on the company.  It is also having an impact on businesses.  In the city of Cork, where I live, there are businesses which are laying people off and retail trade is down.  In everyone's interest, the strike needs to be fixed.  From talking to bus workers, I know there is a willingness on their behalf to go that extra mile to reach a resolution.  I hope we will have it today and that the Labour Court can bring both sides to a place where the dispute can be ended.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the matter of the Department of Defence.

It is great to see the visitors in the Gallery and we, the custodians of these seats, are the representatives of the people.  Leinster House is the people's House and I hope we see more people, such as school groups, community groups etc., coming to visit because it is about the people and their representatives engaging.  The events of 1916 demonstrate the need for us to be more in touch and this may be something for CPP to consider.  On culture night, the gates of Leinster House are opened but perhaps we could have an open day on one other day of the year when Members of the Oireachtas could talk to people in different groups.

It is important to have such a debate in this House and I would be happy to hold one after Easter.  Senator Gallagher raised a number of issues.  It is unusual for public service bonuses to be paid to Department officials but if Senator Gallagher has information on that, I would be happy to take it back to the relevant Department.

It is just a question of whether we have it now or after Easter.  Senator McDowell raised the issue of insurance costs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was in the House on 22 March and he and the Oireachtas committee on finance commissioned a report on the matter.  The report should be highlighted.  There are 33 recommendations and 71 action points.  The intention is to bring about a reduction in premiums but it is also important to recognise that there is a compensation culture in our society and we all pay a premium for that, whether individuals in their motor insurance or local authorities and people in public buildings and shops.  We have to try to change that.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland figures reveal that the level of uninsured driving in Ireland rose from less than 5% in 2013 to 7.1% in 2015 and the payout of between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million is being passed onto motorists.  There is a need for motorists to recognise that we cannot be a compensation-culture society.

The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, and previous Ministers Brian Hayes and Deputy Simon Harris, were committed to the flood relief scheme for Bandon.  Those of us who know Bandon recognise that there are home owners and businesses which are affected annually, sometimes on multiple occasions during the course of a year, and I commend Senator Lombard on his involvement in the scheme.  I will ask the Minister, who is committed to the scheme, to come to the House between Easter and the summer.<\/p> <p>Senator Daly raised the plight of cereal and grain farmers.  The Minister is committed to ensuring that affected farmers receive compensation and it is disappointing to hear there are delays in the redress scheme.

Senator Davitt raised the issue of housing.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, was here on 21 March and I would be happy to invite him back, with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, on a regular basis to provide updates on Rebuilding Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Mulherin joined in the commendation of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, who launched the town and village renewal scheme.

They had a very rumbustious and robust debate with the Senator on the issue of Good Friday.  There are diverging views.  This morning on \"Morning Ireland\" we heard Senator Horkan and Senator Reilly have a very passionate debate on the matter.  I am sure the matter will be debated again.  There is no uniformity of view on it.  The one issue Senator Norris is right to raise is the issue of binge buying of alcohol on Holy Thursday.  It needs to be addressed because we have an issue with the misuse of alcohol in our country.  The Government is committed to doing that in the sale of alcohol Bill.  The Bill will be with us before the summer recess.  The issue of alcohol is one we need to see addressed as a society.  It is a societal issue.  It is important we work to reduce the sale of alcohol and also the harm of alcohol.

It is an interesting point that as a society we have become reliant on our phones and social media.  It is a worry when one sits on buses or is in a pub or restaurant and sees people on the phone rather than engaging in conversation.  Perhaps we will try it as an exercise some day.

In both the House and the health committee, the Senator has been a very strong advocate of the need for a plan to use nursing homes as step-down facilities and also to have a national project on the issue of home care.  He is right.  We have a change in our demographics and we need to plan for it.  We need to have a national plan.

The only problem is that it will be impractical to implement.  The amendment would restrict Waterways Ireland's ability to provide new infrastructure such as moorings and weirs along the canals.  For example, water levels need to be lowered due to flooding and other circumstances which would impede navigation.  Waterways Ireland, through its marine notices, regularly closes navigation to allow special events to take place.  This system has been in place for many years, works well and allows all navigation users' interests to be represented and accommodated.  It has never caused any difficulty.

Therefore, it is very simple.  May I just say that the two examples provided by the Minister are clearly covered by this amendment.  I, therefore, do not understand the Minister's difficulty.  There may be some other reason that the Minister has not put on the record, but I see no reason.  The amendment states \"unnecessarily\".  In other words, whether one can perform the function one wants to perform without closing the canal relates to the whole concept of it being necessary or unnecessary.

In other words, it is the intention of the Minister and the Department to make the canals as accessible as possible to the general public.

I have it.  The Minister is of the view these amendments are unnecessary.  However, the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, can provide evidence that in recent times marine notices are occasionally issued after closures have taken effect.  There is not much point in sending out a notice stating something will be done when the thing has already been done.  This is the actual historical fact.  In the past, marine notices have been sent out after a closure has taken place.  Many notices are occasionally issued after closures have taken effect and works commenced.  There have also been occasions where water level management has not taken into consideration the needs of boat owners.  This is a serious point.  Alterations, notices and all the rest need to be given to people with boats on the water so they can then take the necessary action to protect their boats from damage, either by moving them to a different location on the canal or doing whatever is necessary.  It would risk serious damage to vessels if levels drop from underneath moored boats, grounding the boats, putting pressure on mooring lines and risking boats taking on water and sinking.  At a meeting between the IWAI and Waterways Ireland management, Waterways Ireland assured the IWAI that procedures would be put in place to ensure situations such as that which I described would not happen again.  However, the facts demonstrate, and I have written evidence to this effect, that the situation has occurred again since the meeting took place, and I will give the House the specific locations and dates.  It happened in Lowtown on the Grand Canal in late October 2016, and in Robertstown on the Grand Canal in March 2017.  It actually is a real situation on the ground that has happened.

In this context, with regard to our housing crisis, we must ensure any laws impacting on canal residents are done in such a way that the crisis is not exacerbated.

It simply seeks to ensure that the cost of permits and licences is set at a level that correlates to the intended use and to ensure that there is some linkage with the general level of prices in the economy.

If she feels she cannot accept it, amendment No. 11 is a compromise and also provides for some joined-up thinking in respect of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and rent pressure zones.  As homes on canals might also be homes in rent pressure zones that legislation should link up so that it applies to houseboat owners as well.  Amendment No. 11 deals with increases in costs for permits and licences.  Will the Minister at least accept that canal residents moored in designated rent pressure zones are living in areas where there is huge pressure in the local rental market and that people who live on the water, as opposed to the land, deserve protection from cost increases as much as others?

However, it is not practicable or workable to give due notice before closure of the navigations in an emergency situation.  I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 10 proposes that licences and permits would have to be issued to everybody who is using the canal.  Everybody who uses the canal is not a boat owner.  There are also walkers and cyclists, so they would have to have a licence to use the canal property.  I am aware of what the Senator is trying to achieve in the amendment, but the amendment would not achieve what she seeks.  Waterways Ireland and its predecessors traditionally have only charged boat owners on the canals.  This seeks to widen the charge to all users which would not be practical, for example, with regard to towpath users walking or cycling and whose use and the benefit derived are recognised and supported by the local authorities and Waterways Ireland which are working together to create these off-road amenities.  The amendment is over-restrictive.<\/p> <p>I know what Senator Ruane is seeking in amendment No. 11 but the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 do not apply to Waterways Ireland.  Section 7(1)(p) of the Heritage Bill already provides for the power to make by-laws for the charging and fixing of fees, tolls and charges in respect of the use of the canals by boats, including the use of locks and moorings on the canals and the taking of water from the canals.  The Department's legal advice is that this provision would also include the powers to charge a fee for the issuing of such licences, so there is no need for the additional sentence at section 7(1)(e).<\/p> <p>With regard to linking the costs to the rate of inflation in the economy, the canals are a public asset.  In setting costs for boat users of the canals, such as permits for mooring, Waterways Ireland would set the costs having regard to the fees paid by boat owners for similar facilities on other navigations provided by the private sector.  Costs and fees linked to the rate of inflation could be significantly higher than the modest increases currently being proposed by Waterways Ireland.  The permits or licences issued by Waterways Ireland for boats and residential boats or houseboats are not tenancies.  They are permissions to moor a boat, which could be a houseboat, and usually the boat is owned by the licensee.  Waterways Ireland does not charge rent for moorings.  A licence fee or toll is charged.  As I said earlier, the Residential Tenancies Acts do not apply to Waterways Ireland.  If one applied the inflation rate or the consumer price index since 1988 to the licence fees they would be approximately &euro;300 at present, rather than the modest increase being proposed by Waterways Ireland in the revised canal by-laws of &euro;4, bringing it from &euro;126 to &euro;130.  If we had gone with the consumer price index it would have been much higher.  That is the reason it is not included.<\/p> <p>With regard to amendment No. 12, it is the Department's opinion that there is not need to put in primary legislation what will be in the by-laws.  All of this detail will be in the by-laws and it is more appropriate to include it there.  For that reason it is over-prescriptive to put it in the legislation.  The by-laws will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This sort of detail would be better served in the by-laws and not in primary legislation.

The proposed amendment No. 14 would narrow the power to make by-laws in this area.  Safety, security and access by the emergency services are considerations in everything Waterways Ireland does, so Waterways Ireland has to take account of that anyway.  It is best not to put that in.  Amendment No. 15 is unnecessary as it is a repetition of section 7(1), which is about the powers of Waterways Ireland to make by-laws.

We do not suggest a prescriptive matching with the rate of inflation.  I also note the spirit of what we are doing here follows a very intensive debate in this House on the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  Severe concern was expressed right across the House, including by the Minister's own colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, about the great pressures in areas that have been identified as areas of rental pressure.  I would like if the Minister would indicate that she is understanding of the spirit of it.  In effect, as I know from our meetings with departmental officials, there was a concern that the best market rates available could become a determinant for moorings when looking at the areas of canals.<\/p> <p>We have a community of dwellers.  It is a neighbourhood very close to us here, in Grand Canal Dock.  If Grand Canal Dock were to be treated simply as a commercial proposition, with the aim of maximising the return, I think we would see a displacement of a number of residents who live on the canals and have their homes there.  We would see a further lack of diversification within the area.  We are supposedly committed to a social mix within our neighbourhoods.  There is a real concern.  We have not yet had any assurances that there will be any break put on the costs that may be attached to those who, for example, would seek to moor in an area like Grand Canal Dock.  We have a real concern that we would see a further addition to the high levels of displacement, rental insecurity and persons who may become homeless unless some kind of measure is put in place to manage that issue.

I can assure the Minister that Waterways Ireland did not want to hear anything that would question its authority as a North-South body.  If it is not willing to listen to us as Members of the Oireachtas within the confines of Leinster House, then I would hasten to add that there is little chance that it will listen to ordinary users or to people who are representative of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  There are concerns and there has to be a clear remit given to Waterways Ireland that it cannot drastically increase these costs.  I know that the Minister mentioned an initial increase from &euro;126 to &euro;130, but that is not in the Bill.  There may be some indication from Waterways Ireland that that is what it is about to do, but it is not underpinned in the legislation, nor should it be underpinned in the legislation.  Consultation is required and I very much welcome that.  If there are to be increased by-laws, there should be consultation and that should form part of the 90-days consultation.  I presume that that is the case and any increase in fees will form part of this new 90-day consultation.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>There has to be a bit of leeway here.  It cannot be written in the legislation, but Waterways Ireland, as a North-South body, which receives substantial funding, in the region of 80% from the Irish State and 20% from the Northern exchequer, has to listen to the users here.  The taxpayer is funding its activities.  It has to listen.  It has not done that up until now.  It certainly has not done so in the Barrow network or in other areas.  As I understand it, it is undertaking an investment in the region of &euro;16 million to develop towpaths without any analysis of the impact on flooding or economic analysis of the benefits or otherwise of the project.  There are questions to be asked.  I posed some of these questions at the briefing in Leinster House but there were no answers to very simple questions.  If &euro;7 million is being spent to develop a towpath along the River Barrow, it may or may not have implications for flooding.  A senior engineer working for Kildare County Council said it would have major implications.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Despite this, no study or analysis of the flooding implications was carried out on the project.<\/p><p>Consultation is required and Waterways Ireland, which has done some excellent work, must listen to ordinary stakeholders.

If all else fails and the North-South body is unwilling to listen, the stakeholders need a pathway into the Department through which they can raise concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#S01200","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Some of the matters raised by the Senator regarding the River Barrow are subject to the planning process and a matter for the planning authorities.

I ask Senators to raise any concerns they may have with me and my officials and we will address them.  I was able to arrange a briefing for them, for example, when they sought one.  <\/p> <p>This is enabling legislation to allow the making of by-laws.  Some of the issues causing concern can be included in the by-laws, which is the appropriate forum for addressing them.  <\/p> <p>Waterways Ireland does a great deal of collaborative work with local authorities.  I visited Moate, County Westmeath, this morning to launch the town and village enhancement programme, under which &euro;20 million will be provided for investment in towns and villages in the next 15 months.  Speaking to members of the local authority, they complimented Waterways Ireland on the way it had worked with them in developing blueways and greenways along the route of the Royal Canal.  This was an unsolicited compliment as I had not mentioned Waterways Ireland.  From my experience of working with Monaghan County Council, which works with Waterways Ireland on collaborative projects along the route of the Ulster Canal, the agency is frequently complimented on the collaborative approach it takes to delivering projects along the canal route for the benefit of the wider public.  These projects are good for attracting tourists to areas that do not normally receive many visitors.  Waterways Ireland has a good record and it is appropriate that I defend the organisation.  I often hear it complimented on the good work it does. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#T00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I am 73 years old and I have never been confined by political correctness.

I am glad the report of the proceedings will show that she made that statement because it will enable us to hold her to it later.  However, I remind her of a principle in philosophical logic known as Occam's razor, which prohibits the hypothetical discussion of the non-existent.  Given that the by-laws do not yet exist, any discussion of them is hypothetical.  In this case, Occam's razor rules out the Minister's argument completely because, as I stated, one cannot discuss the hypothetical existence of the non-existent.<\/p> <p>With regard to amendment No. 14, the Minister stated Waterways Ireland would take these matters into account.  This is a highly generalised phrase which does not mean the matter should not be addressed in the legislation.  It is very important that safety, security and access by emergency services are provided for in the main Bill, rather than being left to the goodwill of Waterways Ireland.  I ask the Minister to reconsider her position on this very important amendment because I intend to press it.  The issue of safety, access for the emergency services and so on should not be left to the goodwill of Waterways Ireland.  While nobody questions the agency's goodwill, and I am glad compliments have been paid to it, I also strongly support Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's comments, particularly on the River Barrow pathway and the use of inappropriate materials.  I do not believe planning permission was sought for this project, although retrospective planning permission may be sought.  It is not good practice, particularly for a semi-State body, to rush in, wallop matters through and subsequently seek planning permission.  <\/p> <p>I hope the Minister will reconsider, even if she regards the amendment as somewhat redundant in the sense that it is already provided for.  By saying that, she ceded the principle that access for the emergency services and so forth should be taken into account.  It is no big deal for her to accept the amendment because, according to her, it will not affect practice.  It means, however, that something that is so fundamental to the use of the canals as access by the fire services, ambulances, rescue services and so on should be guaranteed.  That is crucial to the proper and safe use of the waterways.  It should be provided for in the main Bill, rather than being left to the goodwill of Waterways Ireland, which I do not doubt.  I hope the Minister will give way on the amendment because there is no contraindication and it is not causing a problem.  She stated the amendment was redundant because Waterways Ireland already does that for which it provides but Waterways Ireland is not required to do so in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#T00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator that Waterways Ireland is obliged to have regard to safety, security and access by the emergency services.

I get the feeling that the Government was pushed to an extent by the existence of our amendment No. 25 and it is for that reason that it is publishing the notice.  That is very welcome because that shows a certain degree of collegiality between the Minister and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>However, amendment No. 25(iii) now reads to: \"provide to authorised officers for presentation on request for reference purposes a copy, either hard copy or copy by electronic transmission by smart phone, iPad, etc., of the bye laws in the event of a bye law issue being raised by the authorised officer.\"  This is a change from our proposal on Committee Stage because then the Minister said that the authorised officers could not be expected to hump around an enormous book all the time.  Our response was that it is the modern age, there are iPads and smartphones and so on, and it would be no great imposition to have the authorised officers carry the regulations on their smartphones.  <\/p> <p>The Minister makes quite a good point about garda&iacute; not having to produce the Statute Book of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann and the Republic of Ireland which would be very onerous.  However, this was a situation that was established before the existence of smartphones, iPhones and iPads and so on, and now that we have these things, it is not too much to expect that regulations be uploaded onto the smartphone of any authorised officer.  For the sake of convenience, it would be a very good idea if someone is being charged with an offence, that the officer can just turn on the phone and show the person the exact section of the code under which he or she is being charged.  It is not onerous.<\/p> <p>We have listened to the Minister's argument and changed this amendment and it is perfectly reasonable to expect an authorised officer to have the by-laws on a smartphone.  The by-laws of the canals of Ireland are nothing like as extensive as the enormous collection of statute books that a garda would be required to carry around in similar circumstances, had I introduced an amendment covering the Garda.  I do not think that is fair and I am inclined to stick on this.  I am interested in what my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, thinks, what his arguments are and if he has any additional information to add to this if the spirit moves him to contribute.  It seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  When the Minister returns, I will listen to her or any of my other colleagues on either side of the argument and then I will make a decision on whether to pull a vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#X00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Senator Norris's excellent contribution and acknowledge his input into this area of the communication element of enforcing by-laws.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Minister's willingness to accept our recommendations to increase the period of consultation around the objections to by-laws from 21 days to 90 days and placing the onus on Waterways Ireland to have an adequate consultation period which is in line with the consultation period in its own corporate plan.  It affords an opportunity to all stakeholders and users, more importantly some of the stakeholders who are the local authorities or councillors, and the Minister has acknowledged that.  It is important that there is a direct point of interaction between Waterways Ireland - a North-South body - and local councils, where democracy interfaces with the public at the closest point.  <\/p> <p>The Minister's amendment No. 19 places an onus on Waterways Ireland to furnish each local authority with a written copy of any proposals within the functional area of the local authority.  That is vitally important.  The 90 days is important.  Take the example of a by-law issued in July.  If a council did not hold its plenary meeting in August, the 90-day period means that it would still be able to raise objections by its meeting in September.  <\/p> <p>The issue of communicating the by-law by publishing it on the website has been addressed in section (ii) of amendment No. 25.  <\/p> <p>Senator Norris spoke on section (iii) of amendment No. 25 and the need for authorised officers to present the by-law in an electronic or hard copy format.  I am relatively easy on that.  I am not sure whether other authorised officers, such as fisheries officers within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment working for Inland Fisheries Ireland, have to provide regulations.  If they do not, it may be difficult to implement or request Waterways Ireland officials to implement it.  I agree with the thrust of Senator Norris's request.  I can only assume that there are going to be a lot of new by-laws coming down the tracks from Waterways Ireland, given its investment programme and developmental works.  There is nothing wrong with that, and there is consultation built in, but if there are new by-laws coming down the tracks, then if people are in contravention of a by-law, they need to be clearly aware of what it is.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There may be a need to update communications and there are ways of doing it.  For example,  Electric Ireland meter readers bring an electronic device to one's home which can read the meter.  I do not see why officers, whether of Inland Fisheries Ireland, Waterways Ireland or any other State agency, would not have an electronic device.  If one gets registered mail through the post, one does not sign a piece of paper rather one signs on an electronic device.  There is a little pen.  Technology has advanced, albeit I am not sure that is the perspective Senator Norris comes from with the amendment.  It might be something to look at.  I am not sure whether it can be incorporated at this stage.  Is there a rationale for refusing to accept the amendment?  Is there a constitutional issue which prevents it or another reason?<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for accepting the 90-day period.

I appreciate the Minister has now accepted and agreed to a 90-day consultation period, which is a significant improvement.  Government amendment No. 19 is positive in that it clarifies not simply that there will be consultation but that there will be clarity around information on by-laws and an invitation to consultation.  It is positive both in terms of its communication with local authorities and in terms of its general public advertisement provision.  I commend the amendment.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak in favour of amendment No. 25, which is important.  It is not simply a matter of technology but of accountability and transparency.  The authorised officers who will come under this legislation will be the front line of Waterways Ireland and will implement the by-laws.  It is a considerable evolution of the original points put forward by Senator Norris.  He argues not that presentation would be required but for presentation on request.  It is extremely reasonable where one is being told one is in breach of a by-law that one should be able to know, on request, what exact by-law that is and to see it.  It is a reasonable point.  We should bear in mind that in other provisions of the Bill authorised officers are being given the power to issue fixed notice fines.  I urge Fianna F&aacute;il to look at this.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate that she will take it on board on Report Stage.  However, I urge others to support it.  Do we want a situation in which an authorised officer can say one is breaking a by-law, hand over a fine and walk away with no mechanism for appeal in place while one never sees the by-law of which one is supposedly in breach?  It is a reasonable request and it is updated.  It is simply a hard copy or it could be as simple as a phone.  It places an onus on Waterways Ireland to provide authorised officers with the materials they need to do their jobs responsibly and appropriately.<\/p> <p>It is a reasonable amendment to allow one to be clear.  While the analogy of garda&iacute; was used, I note that there are appeals mechanisms where one is fined by a garda.  They may not be adequate and we may have had problems with their implementation but there are structures in place.  With due respect to the Minister, it is not right to suggest that people who feel wrongly treated having been fined under a by-law which they have never seen should pursue redress through the courts.  It is the policy of the Government as stated elsewhere on other occasions to take these kinds of tiny cases out of the courts system.  We do not need someone clogging up the courts system or having to take on the cost of legal counsel simply to contest a &euro;200 fine he or she feels was wrongly imposed.  It is a simple measure.  If we are introducing these powers for authorised officers and the power to introduce by-laws, the least we can provide is a simple transparency at the point of contact.  It is very basic and extremely reasonable.  I cannot understand why it would not be taken on board.  Perhaps the Minister would like to suggest a reworded amendment and carry it through herself, but if it is opposed, I will certainly support Senator Norris should he wish to press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041300002#Y00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1492075800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome some of the points that have been made.  My concern, as I said to the Minister the last time, is that in Carlow-Kilkenny there was no power given in respect of the River Barrow.  One had the local authorities, the OPW and Waterways Ireland but one could not get them when one wanted them.  My main concern is to ensure that in the 90-day consultation period Waterways Ireland contacts every local authority.  I see that it says there should be communication with every local authority in the long term, but local authorities have a 90% input on this because every local authority is different from rural ones to city ones.  Waterways Ireland needs to have meetings with them.  Everyone will know his or her own area best and that is half the work done.  By-laws are also crucial.  Where some small works have needed to be done on the River Barrow, there has been no real point of contact and one did not know who was responsible.  No one took responsibility.  Going forward, by-laws are crucial but they cannot be made without every local authority having an input into the consultation.<\/p> <p>Fees are something that need to be minimal.  We must ensure that this does not go under the radar and that we cannot vouch for it.  Fees must be kept as low as possible.

I do not see why those policing the canals should have to go around with a set of rules and regulations.
