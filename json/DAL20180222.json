I will address the issue of children in situations of immediate risk first and then I will address the issue of neglect.<\/p>  <p>  Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases.  Tusla, when alerted to a child at immediate risk, for instance a young child left alone at home or abandoned, will contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if the child needs to be removed from the situation.  The Garda may, under its section 12 powers in the Child Care Act, remove the child from danger and Tusla will then receive the child into its custody and, following an assessment, may apply for an emergency care order.  Tusla has emergency foster placements available for such situations.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child is identified as being at immediate risk from an adult, Tusla will identify if the child can be protected from that person by their parent or by the removal of the adult posing the risk.  In such situations, Tusla will consult with relevant professionals to share information and to develop a safety plan for the child.  If a child cannot be protected in their home, Tusla will apply to the courts for an emergency care order.<\/p>  <p>  In cases of child neglect, a comprehensive assessment is needed, often involving a number of professionals, and progress needs to be tracked over time.  Neglect is more common than physical abuse or sexual abuse, although there is evidence that children who are neglected may also suffer from physical and sexual abuse.<\/p>  <p>  In neglect cases, parents will be supported to improve their parenting, and parental problems that contribute to the neglect will be identified for intervention.  Parental substance misuse is a key indicator of risk for children.  This was highlighted by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in his report on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a feature in some cases that an immediate improvement may not be sustained, which is why it is important for the child's situation to be monitored over time.<\/p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, concerns should be reported to Tusla.  Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, the Garda should be alerted without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200003#A00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1519295400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>With respect, if that process was working, I would not need to be here raising the issue with the Minister this morning.

The request for tender for the IT system has been published but until such time as an IT developer is in place and agrees a delivery timeframe, it is not possible to confirm and communicate a definitive start date for the scheme.  However, for the purposes of planning and procurement, the scheme's project team has produced estimated target dates, which are set out in the published request for tender.<\/p><p>These dates involve the system being available to accept applications from the end of May 2019, with subsidies being paid from September 2019.  I am committed to updating Deputies, the public and child care providers regarding the expected timeframe as the project progresses.  It is important to note in the interim that enhanced child care schemes and subsidies introduced last September will remain in place.<\/p> <p> The Government delivered on its commitment to make child care more affordable from September 2017 by introducing these enhanced measures.  Currently, over 67,000 children, that is 96% of estimated eligible children, are benefitting from these measures, which include both universal subsidies for children under three and targeted subsidies for those on lower incomes or in training.  The door remains open for more families to apply.  In other words, many of the immediate benefits for parents of the affordable child care scheme have been fast-tracked without compromising on the rigour and time needed to develop and launch this major new scheme.<\/p> <p> Alongside the development of the affordable child care scheme IT system, we continue to make good progress on other elements of the affordable child care scheme.  For example, the Childcare Support Bill has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> When I reported to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 24 January last, I noted that the full affordable child care scheme would mark a radical redesign of the legal and technical infrastructure underpinning our support for child care in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200004#B01500","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519296600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Zappone, for her response.

When we added extra Departments it of course put on extra pressure.  The Minister has outlined certain timelines.  However, the timeline regarding the delivery of ICT concerns me.  If we do not have that timeline in place, while the legislation is working its way through, I cannot see how this will work seamlessly for the providers in September.<\/p>  <p>  That also sets another red flag for me.

In particular, the Act provides for the adoption of any child, regardless of the marital status of his or her parents.  It also provides for the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in respect of any matter, application or proceedings under the Adoption Act 2010.  The Act also provides for the views of the child to be ascertained by the Adoption Authority or a court and for those views to be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>In 2017, I signed the commencement order to give effect to the provisions in the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.  All provisions of the Act other than section 24(1)(<i>a<\/i>) were commenced on 19 October 2017. \u00a0Section 24(1)(<i>a<\/i>) provides that before making an application for a child to be adopted because of parental failure, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, must be satisfied that every reasonable effort has been made to support the parents of the child in question.  This provision came in to operation on 1 February 2018.<\/p><p>I regard the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 as important and progressive legislation.  It makes adoption a realistic option for children of married parents, where appropriate.  It allows the High Court to dispense with parental consent to adoption in certain circumstances and provides for the adoption of a child by civil partners and co-habiting couples.  Importantly, the Act allows for the adoption of a child by his or her step-parent, without the previous requirement for the child's other parent to adopt his or her own child.  This provision addresses a very unsatisfactory situation that prevailed under the earlier legislation.<\/p><p>The legislation has been enacted and commenced.

When introduced, the affordable child care scheme will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, especially lower-income families and lone parents.  It will be available to all families and not just those working full-time or studying full-time.  I will explain this further.<\/p><p>Support for labour market participation as a route out of poverty is central to assisting low-income families and lone-parent households.  Consistent with this objective, participation in work, education or training by parents will determine the maximum number of hours of subsidy available under the new affordable child care scheme.<\/p><p>When parents are engaged in work, education or training, they will be eligible for what we call an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  The enhanced subsidy of 40 hours per week will be awarded to parents in full-time or part-time work, including those on zero-hour contracts as well as those in full-time or part-time education and those participating in labour market activation programmes.  Indeed, it is my intention to define work and study in regulations made under the Bill in broad inclusive terms to recognise the diversity of progression routes to labour market participation.  As such, it is not the case that the enhanced subsidy of 40 hours per week will be limited to parents in full-time work or education.  That is my point.<\/p><p>When parents are not engaged in any form of work, education or training, child care will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to 15 hours per week.

Where this is the case, a referral system under the affordable child care scheme will ensure that families will automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income, work or study test.

Some child care providers operate on a 52-week basis.  Is there scope to change this?  Is the Minister planning amendments to provide the scheme on a 52-week basis?  If the subsidy was averaged out over 48 weeks, it would represent an increase for some of the families I have in mind.  I know the Minister will agree with me in this regard.

The co-ordinators in particular deserve praise for the difference they make to parents' and children's lives by making school a happy experience for students.  The school completion programme operated well under DEIS but it has suffered a reduction in the budget as well as the removal of three national co-ordinators under Tusla.  This means that workers have no direct advocate or link with Tusla.  My colleagues and I spoke to people involved in this and there has been very little communication with Tusla.

My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, will reply in written format to the Deputy about them.<\/p>  <p>  The number of employees of my Department working in the Irish Youth Justice Service at end of each year and to date is as follows.

The whole-time equivalent number stood at 8.6 at the end of 2015 and was 9.6 at the end of 2016.  It was ten at the end of 2017 and stands at 9.9 today.  The whole-time equivalent number of people reflects the fact that some staff in the headcount do not work full-time, so it is a stronger representation of the actual workforce.  On the roles of these staff, there are two principal officers supported by teams from my Department in the IYJS.  One principal officer has responsibility for policy relating to Oberstown Children Detention Campus, including the provision of safe and secure custody for children.

I refer specifically to reports of the backstop commitments being taken out of the withdrawal agreement and put into a separate protocol.  The phase I agreement signed in December provides for three layers of protection against North-South border controls.  In December, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste described these as bullet-proof, rock solid and cast iron, and we all hope they are right.<\/p><p>The first layer of protection was a commitment that the UK economy would remain fully aligned to the EU economy but the UK Government has repeatedly stated it will not do this and its position on this issue has been hardening in recent weeks.  The second layer of protection was that the UK Government would propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland but these have not been forthcoming.  Indeed few outside the UK, or probably even the UK Government, believe that such unique solutions exist.  In the last few days, the European Union's chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, stated:<\/p><blockquote>It is important to tell the truth.  A UK decision to leave the Single Market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.<\/blockquote><p>He made that statement, as the Minister knows, in regard to Ireland. <\/p><p>With the first two layers of protection probably gone, we come to the final layer, the so-called backstop.  The Irish Government's view is that this backstop is unambiguous and comprehensive, ensuring there will be no North-South border controls now or at any stage in the future, but many believe that there is wiggle room within what was agreed in December.  Indeed, the UK Government has a much narrower, more minimalist interpretation of what it signed in December.  I have put Ireland's view of the backstop directly to three UK Ministers and all three refused to accept Ireland's view as to the comprehensive nature of the backstop.  <\/p><p>As of last week, the EU was creating legal text to give legal power to this backstop in order to include it in the withdrawal agreement.  In the last 48 hours however, Ms Jennifer Bray of <i>The Times<\/i>, Ireland edition, reported this is no longer the case and the legal text for the backstop will now be taken out of the withdrawal agreement and put in a separate protocol.  Bloomberg reported that this protocol would sit alongside but outside the withdrawal agreement.  While protocols can, of course, be legally enforceable, in an interview just this week a Conservative peer, when warning about the loss of rights that might happen in the UK, said the following; &quot;The Government [he was referring to the UK Government] does not intend to take into English law the protocols of European Union laws&quot;.  That interview took place in the last 48 hours. <\/p><p>Moving the backstop out of the withdrawal agreement and into a separate protocol feels like a political fudge.  We all hope it is not but that is what it feels like.  The backstop may be the only protection left against hard border controls on the island and it feels as though it has just been weakened.  I therefore wish to ask the Minister the following questions.  Is it true that the legal text for the backstop is being taken out of the withdrawal agreement to sit in a separate protocol?  If that is true, why is it being done?  Does the Government believe that this represents any weakening of the backstop and protections?  Finally, with two of the three layers of protection gone and questions arising on the final one, is it fair to say that the December agreement could no longer be described as bullet-proof? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200012#K00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1519300800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his questions and will begin by saying the December agreement is the agreement we expect to see honoured in full by the British Government.  The Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss Brexit with the British Prime Minister when they met in Belfast last week.  On that occasion, they both reaffirmed the two Governments' shared commitments to the December agreement on Irish issues.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Donnelly correctly outlined, work on developing the withdrawal agreement, including the relevant and important sections on the Irish issues, is very much ongoing.  These provisions were welcomed, including by the Deputy, when they were achieved in December.  They are very important to this country and must be delivered on in full.  The Irish Government is continuing to work very closely with the EU task force on implementing the commitments that were made in December through the withdrawal agreement.  This includes the fallback or default scenario.  We expect this backstop option to be given full legal effect as part of the withdrawal agreement.  At this juncture it is not appropriate for me to comment on exactly how these issues are reflected in the withdrawal agreement, a process that is still ongoing and is at a sensitive stage.  However, we as a Government are in very regular contact with the task force, and I can tell the Deputy, the D&aacute;il and more importantly the Irish people that we are fully satisfied with how these issues are being managed.  We are fully satisfied that full legal effect will be given to the December agreement in any withdrawal agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I will now specifically address the Deputy's two questions.  Yes, we are fully satisfied that full legal effect will be given to the backstop agreement.  This is not just an agreement between Ireland and Britain but an agreement between Britain and the EU.  Through our very regular contact and ongoing engagement with the task force we are satisfied that the agreement must be honoured in full, and we expect that to be reflected in the withdrawal agreement. <\/p>  <p>  On the second issue, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the commentary of individual Members of the British Parliament or individual members of the British Government, because Ireland is not negotiating with Britain.  Ireland is negotiating as part of the EU task force.  The EU task force is negotiating with the British Government.  We should take encouragement as citizens from the solidarity being shown to Ireland by EU member states.  My colleagues the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and indeed all members of Government continue to highlight the importance of Irish issues to EU colleagues.  We are very encouraged by the fact that we have seen so much solidarity from other member states.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that we are at a very sensitive stage in the negotiations, and I appreciate that a very sensitive and complex discussion is going on in the British Government, upon which it would not be appropriate for me, as a member of the Irish Government, to comment.

When the Minister said that the backstop will be given legal effect in the withdrawal agreement, is that in answer to my question of whether it will be in a separate protocol?  In other words, when he says it will be in the withdrawal agreement, is it therefore the case that it will not sit alongside the agreement in a separate protocol?<\/p>  <p>  My second question regards sanctions and enforceability, because we all know what is likely to happen.  There will be a legal text somewhere, be it in the protocol or the withdrawal agreement.  Fianna F&aacute;il's firm view is that it must be in the body of the main withdrawal agreement and not in a separate protocol.  The UK is likely to engage in different tariffs, different regulatory issues, and put pressure on the Northern Border.  It is likely that we will come to a stage where the EU rules that a certain measure cannot be introduced, because it would force it to put border controls around the Six Counties.  The British government is likely to disagree, arguing that it has not imposed border controls so it has not infringed on anything.  Obviously the UK will not sit within the legal jurisdiction of the EU.  To what enforcement body is the Irish Government expecting to have recourse, and what types of sanctions will be available?

If a party wants to introduce its own legislation to bring about the desired end, we will support it without question.<\/p><p>We need to insert a little honesty into the debate.  Regulation of vulture funds will not stop the threat of repossession.  The only thing currently stopping the regulated banks from repossessing properties <i>en masse<\/i>is the potential impact on the long-term return on their investments and the effect on their reputations as companies operating in communities in which they are looking for business.  That is not how vulture funds operate.  They are only interested in short-term turnaround and quick profit.  These funds, regardless of whether they are regulated, have no interest in reaching solutions with homeowners and no interest in restructured loans or interest only payments.  There is no incentive for them to behave as members of society.  They are not bound by the same sense of community.  They are ruthless and, therefore, the sale of Permanent TSB loans to vulture funds puts 14,000 families and 4,000 renters in an extremely vulnerable position.  There is no doubt that if it proceeds, there will be large scale repossessions, regulated or not.<\/p><p>The impression is now being given publicly that by simply regulating these funds, mortgage holders will have some magical protection that they do not currently have.  That has made the situation even worse because it has created a pathway for banks which heretofore would not have sold to vulture funds to do so .  The impression now is that if these funds are regulated, it is okay to sell to them.  That is simply not the case.  The Government can do something about this.  Families and renters are watching these proceedings and hoping and praying that the Government will stand up to the vulture funds and stop this sale.  If we are honest about this then stopping the sale is the only way to prevent mass repossessions.  The Taoiseach said it would be illegal to direct the banks not to sell loans.  That is fair enough but it is not illegal for the Minister for Finance or, indeed, the Government to inform the Permanent TSB of the position of its major shareholder, namely, the Government.  Indeed, that is not even unprecedented.  On previous occasions, the Minister for Finance brought in representatives from the banks in respect of the tracker mortgage scandal and high interest rates and outlined the Government's position.  The Government is refusing to do that in the context of this matter.<\/p><p>Does the Minister accept that simply regulating vulture funds will not provide additional protections to the 14,000 mortgage holders and 4,000 renters if their loans are sold to such funds?  If he does accept that, will the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, call in the banks to tell them what Sinn F&eacute;in has been asking them to do for the past number of years, namely, not to sell long-term products such as mortgages on family homes to vulture funds that only have a short-term interest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200013#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519301400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I accept his bona fides on this.  He has raised this issue for many years.  As a Government, an Oireachtas and, indeed, a country, we have to work our way through two issues.  The first of these is how to protect mortgage holders and the second is how to ensure that we have a functioning, stable banking system, not for the banks but for citizens who need access to mortgages and credit for their farms or small business or who need to put money on deposit and know they will get a decent interest rate.  How do we work our way through those two issues?  I am conscious that many mortgage holders are worried and concerned.  Taking out a mortgage to buy a home is the biggest financial commitment a person will ever make and to think that there could be uncertainty or lack of assurance over that can only give rise to concern.  Like the Deputy, the Government is eager to work with everybody in the House to find a way forward and to work out how we can provide maximum certainty, clarity and assurance to mortgage holders while we continue to minimise repossessions.  Many Members talked about mass repossessions only being around the corner, but, thankfully, that never came to pass.  They also said that mortgage arrears would continue to increase but these have fallen quarter on quarter for many years.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance said yesterday - and it is the appropriate and prudent thing to do - that he has asked the Central Bank to provide further advice and guidance to him on the current legislation and regulation and indicate whether there is any need to improve or enhance that.  He went further and said that he is willing to work with the Opposition.  He had a constructive meeting yesterday with the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on finance and a Bill will be introduced by our colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Kevin \"Boxer\" Moran.  The Deputy also has suggestions.  There is time because these loans have not been sold.  They have not gone on the market and the Minister for Finance has not yet been consulted.  There will be time to engage on the matter in this House and there will be time for the Minister to be consulted by the bank.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to be truthful with people, however.  We have to acknowledge the fact that we have a bank which, despite the recovering economy and the fact that we are almost at full employment, has on its loan book one of the highest ratios of non-performing loans in the eurozone.  We also have to acknowledge the fact that when Members interfered with or ignored regulatory advice regarding the banks in the past, the Irish people bore the heavy consequences and deep scars of that and they still do to this day.  Mortgage arrears are falling and home repossessions have been kept to an absolute minimum.  There is time to work our way through this and to achieve a balance between the two aims we need to achieve for our citizens, namely, to protect mortgage holders and provide them with certainty and assurance and grapple with ensuring that this bank, which employs more than 2,000 people and has more than &euro;17 billion on deposit, is stable and complies with regulatory advice.  We are, therefore, eager to engage.  No one has a monopoly on good ideas and, certainly, no one has a monopoly on compassion or concern for mortgage holders.  The Government will work with all parties to find a way forward.  As the Minister for Finance said, there is time to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200013#L00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1519301400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Minister said that we have time.  At my request, we have invited Permanent TSB representatives to appear before the finance committee on Tuesday next.  Deputy Michael McGrath made a similar request.  Permanent TSB representatives have told us that they have entered into confidentiality clauses with prospective buyers.  The train has left the station.  These are vulture funds and the problem is that the perception is that by simply regulating them, everything will be okay.  It will not be okay because the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which contains a suite of options, is completely voluntary in nature.  Vulture funds do not offer those options.  They do not do split mortgages, interest-only payments or arrears capitalisation.  A total of 84% of the more than 120,000 restructures that have been done so far have not involved these funds.  I want to see the regulation of vulture funds.  I want them, and not the middleman, to be punished if they break the law.  Primarily, I want to ensure that the 14,000 mortgage holders and 4,000 renters will not be thrown to the wolves.<\/p><p>If we are honest in this debate, and the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il know and we in Sinn F&eacute;in know, it is not simply a question of the regulation of the vulture funds.  If long-term products are sold to companies that have a three or five-year interest, it will only end one way, in repossessions.  People will be evicted and there will be more homelessness.  We cannot stand here as legislators and pretend that there is some type of magic solution.  There is a solution: the Government owns 75% of the bank.  The Minister should lift the phone and tell Jeremy Masding that the Government refuses to stand idly by while he is about to throw his customers to the wolves, just because the bank did not get its act in order over the past three years and work down those mortgages in the way it should have done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200013#L00400","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519302000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I think Permanent TSB should go before an Oireachtas committee.

It goes on to note that \"Significant funding has been secured as part of the Capital Plan.\"  This is another promise which I can prove is not being delivered on.<\/p>  <p>  Two years later these words in the programme for Government mean nothing to dozens of families of children seeking to go to St. Brogan's College, Bandon.  Over the past four months these parents have been living a nightmare as their children were put on a waiting list for entering the school in September 2018.  St. Brogan's is a victim of its own success, in that the school's positive attitude and excellent staff have made it attractive to many families.  More important, subjects are suited to certain students and in an era where parents and children sit down together and choose the best school for their child with the subjects that are on offer, St. Brogan's makes that choice somewhat easier for them.<\/p>  <p>  All this has meant that the school must cater for more students than it has room for.  The Department of Education and Skills may have sanctioned four additional classrooms but this is all too late for the many who are at the moment being left outside the door.  One child, both of whose parents both attended St. Brogan's, and who lives only a few dozen feet from the school, across the road, cannot be taken in due to overcrowding.  This child is heartbroken as he is the only child in his classroom who did not get a place.  I spoke to another mother as late as last night who said that she is not sending her child to any other school as this is best suited for her child.  Another father cannot understand why his son cannot get a place in the school he was educated in.  These genuine stories are endless.  I am dealing with many more families in the Bandon school catchment area with extremely difficult stories who want to send their children to this school but they will not be accepted as there is no more room.  The school has written to the families to say that it cannot cater for the children but when I speak to these families they still hold out hope that their children will be accepted because they know, as I do, that this can be resolved simply.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the additional classrooms not being in place on time for September, will the Department of Education and Skills work with the education and training board, ETB, and the school and immediately put in train works that will put temporary classrooms in place in St. Brogan's by September, thus catering for the many children left outside the door? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200014#M01100","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1519302000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins for raising this important matter for the people of Bandon and for the St. Brogan's College school community.

I understand that St. Brogan's is a multidenominational, coeducational second level school with a very good reputation to which many families want to send their children.  It is under the patronage of the Cork Education and Training Board.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to be able to respond positively to Deputy Michael Collins's request for interim accommodation because, as he correctly says, the Department of Education and Skills approved permanent accommodation for this school in December.  This will comprise four mainstream classrooms and two resource teaching rooms.  Once the Department approves accommodation it is often devolved to the local patron to deliver it.  The delivery of that project is the responsibility of Cork ETB.  It has been given the green light and the funding by the Department of Education and Skills and this Government.  I am very pleased that is the case.  <\/p>  <p>  We do need to consider what can be done in the interim.  Pending the construction of the permanent accommodation we need to see whether some interim accommodation can be provided.  I understand that the ETB in Cork has now submitted an application for interim temporary accommodation.  The Department is responding very positively to this application and has confirmed to the ETB that the classroom accommodation will be approved.  I am informed that the ETB will make arrangements to put the interim accommodation in place.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this will come as good news to those worried about accessing a school place but as our population continues to grow and our economy recovers and we can invest more in our public services, this Government is building more schools and providing more school places than ever before in the history of the State.  In the national development plan, our new capital plan, our vision for a new, brighter Ireland, Ireland 2040, announced last Friday in Sligo, we have enhanced and added further to that in the scale of our ambition, to make sure schools not just provide places but that they are provided with modern, fit-for-purpose facilities for physical education, PE, information and communication technology, ICT, and laboratories at second level.  We have a very ambitious plan for school building projects across the country.  As we consider what can be done in the interim in places such as Bandon, we will always respond positively to applications from patron bodies for temporary solutions and that is what we have done in this case.

It relates to the procedure and process for the assessment of needs of children with disabilities.  The Department of Health and the HSE are breaching the law on a daily basis in this regard.  The Minister is aware that, under the Disability Act 2005, the assessment of needs must begin no later than three months after the receipt of a completed application.  I am regularly contacted by parents who find that there is a huge backlog in the assessment of needs for children with disabilities.  I have one such case before me where the parent was told that the application was received on 1 June 2017.  The parent was advised that the scheduled date of commencement was to be on or before 1 September 2017.  The parent then received correspondence confirming that the application was received on 1 June and that the child's case was discussed at a forum meeting on 20 June 2017.  The letter states, &quot; ... [the case] was discussed at the Disability Services monthly administration meeting and his scheduled date for assessment is January 2019 (based on current resources).&quot;  This means that the assessment will be completed 18 months after the initial application.  This correspondence cites increased referral rates and lack of resources as the reasons for this.  The Minister must remember that an early assessment of needs for these children is a legal obligation on the HSE, on the Department of Health and on the Minister himself.  The assessment of needs is to start within three months of application and is to be completed within three months of starting the assessment.  The Minister is well aware that these children are diagnosed as early as possible in order to ensure that proper services are available to them.<\/p><p>I have received further correspondence from another parent which states:<\/p><blockquote>As you are aware there is already a massive backlog of referrals for AON.  The Assessments of Need are not being carried out in accordance with legislation and regulations under the Disability Act 2005.  Assessments of need are supposed to be conducted in a consistent manner nationally and procedures are supposed to be in place to ensure continuity of the AON process, yet again this is not happening.<\/blockquote><p>Will the Minister indicate when his Department and the HSE will stop breaching the law and ensure that the assessment of needs process relating to children with disabilities is completed in accordance with the Disability Act 2005?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200015#N00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1519302600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Healy for raising this very important issue on the assessment of needs for children with disabilities.  He is entirely correct; this is an area in which the State needs to do an awful lot more.  The lost decade affected the ability to recruit to and invest in vital public services and this means that we have a backlog through which we need to work.  We are committed to doing just that.  Deputy Healy will have seen that we have significantly increased the number of speech and language therapists working in local areas.  These therapists are an important part of assessment teams.  We hired 80 more last year and, under the HSE service plan for this year, there will again be an increase in the level of resources for speech and language therapy.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly in the area of psychology, which is an important in the context of any team that supports children with disabilities within our communities, we are going to recruit 135 psychology assistants.  This will help with that aspect of assessments.  The HSE is also currently developing its operational plan for each community health care organisation.  This plan will outline the level of service the organisations intend to be able to provide this year to people with disabilities.  Given that we have significantly increased the health budget to more than &euro;15 billion, I expect that the people about whom the Deputy speaks will see this reflected in the operational plans for their areas.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the lack of consistency regarding the geographical spread of resources.  The Deputy has touched upon this matter.  Autism, for example, is a disability issue that concerns many parents who come to my constituency clinic.  I am sure Deputy Healy sees such parents at his clinic also.  I asked the HSE to carry out an analysis of autism services assessment teams throughout the State in order to map where we have a good service and where we do not.  This is so that the resources can be put in place.  I have just received the report this week and I will now work my way through it, with the ultimate purpose to have an evidence base in respect of the location of resources.  If there are certain areas with particular backlogs and waiting lists for assessment of needs that are above and beyond the national norm, then we need to target resources in to those areas.  I have discussed this issue with the HSE and I am aware that it is a key priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  With this and the extra respite service we will see in community health care organisations, GP visit cards for carers and medical cards for all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, I hope we will make a real improvement.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that this is an area in which we must do a great deal more.  I will be very happy to speak with Deputy Healy directly about his community health care organisation experience and I will certainly follow up on the details of any cases he may wish to provide.  We are investing a lot more in this area and we are recruiting more staff.  Staff is the key component in these teams.  If we are to drive down the waiting times for the assessment of needs, we need to have more health professionals in our community health care teams.  This is a priority for the Government.  There will be more recruitment this year and that will build on the additional recruitment last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200015#N00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1519302600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I put it to the Minister that this is in breach of the law.  This is not a regulation or a target.  The Department and the HSE are in breach of the law.  More importantly, they are denying young children with a disability an early diagnosis so that proper and specific services can be provided to them.  I ask the Minister to follow up on this matter and to ensure that the HSE is adhering to the law rather than breaching it.

These increases build on the increase in 2017.  I am aware that this is a major priority for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  We are building up services county by county to make sure there are appropriate teams in place and to reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also makes an important point about being able to access services at an early age.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is looking at how children can access services in schools either while waiting for diagnoses or without specific diagnoses.

As we speak, she is in excruciating pain such that she has said, \"It&rsquo;s gotten to the stage where I&rsquo;ve asked the doctor is it possible to cut off my nerve endings, because, even though I&rsquo;d end up paralysed, at least I wouldn&rsquo;t be in pain\".  That is a real person.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, if the Government will give time in this House to further discuss this issue.  People have gone through the appeals process and been rejected.  They have nowhere else to go to alleviate their pain.  It is still very much a live issue.  My request is simple.  We need to have further deliberation on this issue.

It has been made by clinicians in the medicines management programme of the HSE.  I would like to make it clear that there is a process for GPs to appeal.  These are real people too.  More than 850 people who do not have shingles have now been approved, which means that more than a third of people have been completely approved.  This is about the appropriate use of a medication which, in the view of the doctors and clinicians who advise me, can cause adverse effects if inappropriately used.

To give one example, a seven year old in my constituency, Harry Whitaker, had an assessment of needs in June 2015.  As a result of an error on the HSE's behalf, he was not placed on a waiting list.  He made an appeal, which was successful, but he was then placed on the waiting list at the point at which the appeal was successful in March 2016 rather than the point at which he had his needs assessed.

This is a pro-consumer Bill and represents the second consumer protection Bill I have presented to the D&aacute;il in recent months, the previous one being on the proper regulation of gift vouchers.  It is clear that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is missing legislative teeth as the national competition regulator to enforce breaches of competition law and to deter anti-competitive behaviour to the detriment of consumers.  Currently the CCPC cannot issue administrative sanctions or penalty fines for breaches of EU and Irish competition law.  In Ireland, fines can only be imposed following a criminal conviction in courts.  Since 2014 only one such fine has been imposed, which amounted to just &euro;17,500.  However, the CCPC is &quot;strongly of the view that the current competition law enforcement regime in Ireland is not fit for purpose as it does not provide for an appropriate range of effective and dissuasive sanctions for breaches of EU and Irish competition law&quot;.  <\/p><p>The CCPC, in a submission to the Law Reform Commission, is strongly in favour of introducing administrative enforcement powers.  The CCPC has stated &quot;the absence in Ireland of civil or administrative fines for breaches of competition law very significantly undermines the CCPC&rsquo;s ability to combat anti-competitive conduct&quot;.  It also has stated this &quot;means that there is little deterrent effect in such cases: industry knows that it may as well try to engage in such conduct, because even if the CCPC intervenes to stop it, they are not at a loss&quot;.  In contrast, competition regulators in 21 other EU member states, including the UK, Italy, France and Denmark, can issue administrative fines, while Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Australia can also do likewise.  <\/p><p>Anti-competitive behaviour by big companies, acting alone or in unison, can cause significant damage to competition in sectors and to consumers.  Common forms of anti-competitive cartel activity include bid rigging and a practice known as cover pricing.  Giving the CCPC the power to impose administrative fines on corporate entities in this Bill would significantly strengthen the regulator's investigations and sanctioning in sectors where anti-competitive activity is allegedly taking place.  These powers would aid enforcement, given that the CCPC has previously investigated suspected anti-competitive conduct in the ticketing sector and the motor insurance sector, for example. <\/p><p>The Bill I am introducing today amends the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 by adding six new sections.  It is lazy of the Government to state it would be unconstitutional to allow an authority such as the CCPC to issue fines for prohibited anti-competitive practice.  The Supreme Court, in a Law Reform Commission report, has already recognised the need for certain bodies to be able to issue civil fines in certain circumstances.  There is precedent, with administrative financial sanctions currently provided by regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation, and the Data Protection Commissioner.  This Bill provides for the mechanism that is used by other bodies by making the CCPC confirm its decision to issue a sanction against an undertaking by applying to the High Court for confirmation of its decision.  We provide for an appeals process, both for the CCPC decision to the High Court and the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal.  This Bill allows the CCPC to issue a fine to a company of up to &euro;100 million or 10% of its turnover in most cases.  The 10% turnover figure is used in many other jurisdictions.  We look forward to bringing the Bill to Second Stage, and we seek leave of the House to do so.

As I was saying last night, we know that every major metropolitan region in Europe is pulled along economically by a dynamic city at its core.  Dublin has begun to wear that mantle since the turn of this century but it would be invidious if we now came along with this kind of indicative plan, or legislative plan, which would restrict the development and growth of Dublin.  After all, Dublin is still a relatively small city by comparison with, for example, the 5 million population of Athens, the 5 million-plus in Barcelona, the near 5 million in Manchester, the 3 million to 4 million in Vienna or the 2 million-plus in Budapest.  When we compare it with what we would regard as premier division cities of the European Union, Dublin is still a relatively small city of some 1.5 million people, if we count the four Dublin counties.<\/p>  <p>  Although there is no reference to it in the plan, one noticeable aspect of all of those dynamic cities is that they have an elected local city leadership.  This is one thing we could have advanced and had ready for 2019, particularly for Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>Dublin critically needs infrastructure across a range of areas, from health to transport to schools to housing.  At Leaders' Questions last week, I raised the urgent need for social and affordable housing in the city and the four Dublin local authority areas.  My constituency of Dublin Bay North has the longest housing list in Ireland.  The plan remains lethargic in that regard.  The delivery for 2015-17 in which the Minister was involved has not happened, or at least not in Fingal and Dublin city.  I welcome the social housing target of 20,000 to 25,000 units for 2020 and subsequently the 30,000 to 35,000 target.  We still seem to be running to stand still.<\/p> <p> I do not disagree with the idea of there being a more compact city in appropriate areas although the people who make these planning decisions should be prepared to live in more compact high-rise buildings themselves.  One finds that the people who make these plans live way out in the countryside in large haciendas and plan for others to live on the fourteenth floor or the fifth floor with no lift, which has happened to residents in my constituency.  The plan does not recognise the full scale of the housing crisis in Dublin.  While I welcome the national regeneration development agency, it is not the agency which I asked that the Taoiseach set up, which would have been available to look at all land.  We need close cohesion with local plans, such as the Fingal plan and the Dublin city plan in my constituency.  In the north fringe and south fringe we have had the awful situation where there was no strategic development for a new urban region, which was effectively another city the size of Waterford, and have suffered all the massive problems for the last decade as a consequence.<\/p> <p> In transport, I warmly welcome what I hope is the final decision to proceed with metro north.  I cannot understand why it would be delayed in any way in order to link up with the existing Luas green line.  Naysayers such as Colm McCarthy have come out already to complain about the &euro;3 billion cost of this public transport infrastructure but we will soon have one of the biggest airports in Europe and one of the few airports in a major city that does not have a fixed-line rail link to the city centre.  I welcome it because originally we were to have a northside Luas.<\/p> <p> Referring briefly to national infrastructure, I do not understand the lack of any plan for a motorway to the north west and why it is not a national task.  Why is the M11 not extended all the way to Rosslare given Brexit?  I support the Cork to Limerick and Western corridors as timely connective developments.  If any of these huge infrastructure developments take place it will lead to significant jobs growth but we have to worry whether the 660,000 jobs mentioned can be delivered.<\/p> <p> I do not have the time to raise the concerns I have on education and on the marine environment, which I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will raise himself, but on health I do not see the influence of Sl&aacute;intecare and its delivery in the plan.  The plan refers to a new elective hospital for our region.  In the northside, Beaumont has always been at 120% to 130% capacity.  I do not see why the proposed new hospital should not be somewhere such as Swords or the Swords-Donaghmede interface.<\/p> <p> Strategic planning for the country's future is of the upmost importance but Project Ireland 2040 would have been better had there been cross-party agreement.  There will be some legislative plans on planning regulations and so on but there should be general agreement on how we advance Ireland and make it a prosperous, peaceful and well-developed country by 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200021#W00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519306500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Project Ireland 2040, our plan for our country until 2040 but particularly, for the purpose of this statement, our capital spending plan for the next ten years.  I am particularly pleased to speak about the very significant increase in capital funding for the health service as a result of this plan.  Capital funding for our health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was for the last ten years.  This is a sea-change commitment to capital investment in our health services.  It means we now have a solid, ambitious plan to build a better health service for the future through the combination of this significant capital investment programme alongside the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.<\/p>  <p>  We now have the opportunity to reform and modernise our health service, to deliver one that is fit for purpose, that our citizens can be proud of and that can meet the needs of our growing and aging population.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our health services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care and modernise how we deliver services through ehealth and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  As our population changes and ages, the way in which health care is currently delivered in Ireland will become increasingly unsustainable.  New models of care are needed, including a major shift from hospital centric to community-based care.  Significant population growth and an increase in the population aged 65 years and over and in particular aged 85 years and over, in the next ten years will increase demand for health and social care services.  The fact that people in Ireland are living longer and longer than the European average is a good thing, but we must plan accordingly to meet their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Government supports the vision for a high quality, safe, accessible and sustainable healthcare system set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Implementing that vision will require concrete and well-defined steps to be taken which are prioritised, sequenced, co-ordinated and funded.  As part of this process, capital investment has a key role to play both in enhancing health service provision and as a driver of reform.  Too often we speak about current health spending but do not spend enough time discussing the important difference which capital funding can make in reforming and increasing the capacity of our health service.  Modernisation will require significant investment, including in ICT and ehealth, to underpin safer, more integrated, patient-centred care.  At the same time, as with any health system, there is an ongoing need to maintain and update facilities and healthcare equipment.  Government priorities in health capital investment supports the national planning framework outcomes in terms of plans to provide local, regional and national developments which empower rural communities and enhance urban amenities, which are outcomes Nos. 6 and 7 in the framework.  Capital investments over the coming decade will support existing Government priority projects and commitments and will enable the roll-out of new additional capacity guided by the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recently published health service capacity review.<\/p>  <p>  There are several drivers of the development and reform of the health services over the ten year period of the plan.  The main ones include capacity since demographic changes, including an increasing and older population, and mean that the level and complexity of health care to be provided will increase.  I will never understand why a policy decision was taken in 2007 to reduce the number of hospital beds in this country when the population was rising.  We recognised that in education there would be more children who would need school places and we provided more school places, yet bizarrely the Government of the day decided to reduce the number of hospital beds in successive years between 2007 and 2010, and they remained reduced during the recession until 2014 when they began to increase.  We need to increase capacity and the plan will deliver that.<\/p>  <p>  A second driver is the need to deliver strategy.  The strategy for the public health services is centred on integrated healthcare.  This involves a decisive shift towards primary care to meet growing demands.  I am pleased that this plan features &euro;810 million for primary care including investment in diagnostics.  There are many really good primary care facilities.  On Monday, I will open two more, one in Kilcock and one in Coolock, but we need to put the diagnostic equipment into them.  They must have the X-ray machines and ultrasounds so that people do not have to go to a hospital for every diagnostic test that could take place in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Another area is ICT and innovation.  The implementation of the ehealth strategy is required to develop the electronic records system, which enables the flow of information across various care settings.  It will also enable patients, our citizens, to be more empowered in their own health information.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to deliver on risk and compliance.  There is an ongoing need to maintain and update both buildings and healthcare equipment and ambulances in particular in response to critical clinical risks.  These are risks that exist in our health service which we need to fix.  Now that the country&rsquo;s economy is growing once again, we can invest in improving theatres, building ward blocks and replacing ambulances.<\/p>  <p>  This leads me to the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, and the recently published Health Service Capacity Review.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report has significant implications for capital investments, which I welcome.<\/p><p>The report strongly endorses investment in ICT and eHealth, and the Government's national development plan will provide the required capital investment in Health to fully delivery on eHealth in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report and the Government's national development plan strongly support capital investments in primary care, including community diagnostics.  When Deputy Broughan rightly asks me what will the capital plan do to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, I say it will deliver diagnostics in the community, which is a key element of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will deliver in full a very significant investment in eHealth, which also is a key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare, and will drive down waiting lists through elective-only hospitals, which is another key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  These are three key recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I note the presence of my colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, who is key on this committee to reform the health service.  We are taking three solid steps to reform the health service in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare through this capital plan.<\/p> <p> The national development plan will support Sl&aacute;intecare's recommendation that the outcome of the capacity review should be used as a framework for guiding future investments in health services.  When I became Minister for Health, I commissioned a capacity review.  We got it internationally benchmarked to answer the question, how many hospital beds do we need in Ireland now and how many hospital beds will we need in Ireland out to 2031, so that we could put an evidence base behind it.  It stated clearly that even if we reform the health service and implement Sl&aacute;intecare, which we will do, we still will need 2,600 more hospital beds by 2031.  I am delighted that this capital plan will deliver all of those beds four years ahead of schedule.  We will deliver, and fully fund, the capacity review by 2027.  Obviously, now we need to look for opportunities to front-load that and I have already asked the HSE to examine what front-loading could be done in this regard.<\/p> <p> We need continued investment in primary care facilities and the development of community diagnostic hubs and our ageing population will require the delivery of significant additional step-down and long-stay facilities.  In this plan, we are not only delivering more hospital beds and more diagnostics in the community.  I am pleased that we will also provide an additional 4,500 community step-down beds and long-stay facilities for our older citizens to get people back to the community and out of the acute hospital setting where they have no wish to be once they have received their medical care.  Those additional 4,500 community beds are on top of the refurbishment and replacement of community nursing homes which is already under way.<\/p> <p> We will deliver new elective-only facilities: one for Dublin, one for Galway and one for Cork.  The idea here is that high-volume low-complexity procedures - many of the procedures for which people wait on the waiting lists - can be dealt with through elective-only facilities where we are decoupling scheduled and unscheduled care and the pressures of both.  What we are doing here is learning from other jurisdictions.  We are learning from Scotland where they put in place an elective-only facility and managed to dramatically reduce their waiting times.  It took them ten years to get the waiting time down to 12 weeks but they did that, and they made incremental progress.  I do not want Members to think we have to wait ten years for things to happen.  We need to make incremental progress, each month and each year, until we can get to where we want to be.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is a ten-year plan, elective-only facilities are the way to deliver it and the Scottish people and health service have shown us how we can do that.  It is envisaged that these facilities will be sited adjacent to general hospitals and I will now ask that the HSE put in place a process to identify where best to locate these facilities.  I would like these to be up and running as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> There are a number of major projects which will be delivered over the lifetime of Project Ireland, including the new national children's hospital at St. James's campus.  People have been talking for decades about delivering a children's hospital.  We are building it - it is under way in St. James's - and two children's outpatient and urgent care centres, one in Blanchardstown and one in Tallaght hospital in Dublin.<\/p> <p> I note that, yesterday, there was much discussion in these Houses about the national maternity strategy.  I am delighted that, as part of this capital plan, we will relocate all stand-alone maternity hospitals to acute hospital campus, providing women and their babies with world-class 21st-century facilities.  Holles Street will move to St. Vincent's, University Maternity Hospital, Limerick will move to the site of the University Hospital Limerick, the Rotunda will move to the Connolly Hospital site and the Coombe to the St. James's campus.<\/p> <p> In relation to the cancer strategy, we will also deliver the capital developments, including the national programme for radiation oncology at Cork, Galway and Dublin and the expansion of BreastCheck.  We will build the new national forensic mental health service hospital at Portrane.  We will continue with the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  We have commenced phase 1 and we will now fund phase 2.  The primary care centre construction programme will continue at locations right across the country, as will the replacement and refurbishment of the community nursing homes for older people and long-term residential care units for those with disabilities and the implementation and delivery of the trauma system.<\/p> <p> With the unprecedented capital investment in the health services, we must ensure that we carefully plan and select projects.  This process will be guided by the national health strategy and policy, including the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We will have a robust method of project appraisal, assessment and selection in order to ensure that these are delivered appropriately.<\/p> <p> In summary, the provision of this unprecedented capital investment of &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years will help us build that better health service that citizens yearn for, that staff deserve and that, quite frankly, we all need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200022#X00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Romanian Delegation","time":1519307100,"counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1519307100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Before proceeding with business, I wish on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome, to a distinguished delegation of Romanian parliamentarians, led by Senator Viorel Badea, Chairman, Committee for the Romanians Abroad, who are in attendance in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, and accompanied by Her Excellency Mrs. Manuela Breazu, Ambassador of Romania to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  You are all welcome to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I hope you find your visit useful and to our mutual benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)","time":1519307100,"counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1519307100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, who is leaving the Chamber, is probably too young to remember a television programme called &quot;Jackanory&quot; but the speech he just delivered would have featured as one of the classics on the old &quot;Jackanory&quot; programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1519307100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I myself cannot remember that one.

I was surprised when I picked up the <i>Evening Herald<\/i>yesterday to see a double-page spread that, to a person browsing through the newspaper, appears like normal articles.  It is a double-page spread of articles but at the top is the little giveaway, &quot;In partnership with the Government of Ireland.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00700","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1519307100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>This is not customary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519307100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>To the ordinary reader, that is a two-page spread article with quite a tabloid-like presentation.<\/p>  <p>  It includes interviews with a number of persons, one of which is with the famous singer from Aslan, Mr. Christy Dignam.  Christy is quoted in it.  He welcomes it and states that it is very good news for Finglas, which it is, and he wishes the building work would not take nine years.  Someone did not tell him that the building work will take nine years from 2027 because the Finglas Luas line is not included in the projects from 2018 to 2027.  The advertisement also implies that construction work on this is beginning tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev is quoted in the advertisement as well and a Finglas youth worker is also quoted.  The youth worker is quoted as saying, \"The link will give young people a better chance in life.\"  What I am asking is, what young people of what generation are being thought of here?  It certainly will not give the young people who live in Finglas right now a better chance in life, as the Minister will be aware, because this will be post-2027.  A child born in Finglas today will not set foot on this Luas until he or she is about to enter post-primary school.  In fact, well beyond post-primary school, he or she could be going to college because this is a plan for post-2027.<\/p>  <p>  Did any of the three persons who feature in this article know they were contributing to an advertisement feature or that this was part of the Government's communication strategy?  Was anybody paid to contribute to this article?  How much did this double-page spread cost in a major national newspaper?  Essentially, this is a party political advertisement in a national newspaper in what is a marginal constituency in which the sitting Fine Gael Deputy is fighting to hold on to his seat.  Therefore, this is targeted political advertising that is, essentially, being paid for by the taxpayer.  In the words of Christy Dignam, I can ask, \"How can I protect you from this crazy [Government]\", as opposed to \"crazy world\"?\"  This is something we will be coming back to repeatedly.<\/p><p>If the Government is trying to communicate with people in relation to developments, why is not taking out advertisements in national newspapers about the chronic traffic congestion in Dublin or explaining the dangerous overcrowding on Luas, the recent electricity breakdown that affected hundreds of businesses at peak time in Dublin or all the porkies the Taoiseach told about hospital waiting lists this week, on which he was called out by an exceptionally reputable journalist in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>?  I checked one or two of the newspapers that serve my area, <i>Southside People<\/i>being one, <i>The Echo<\/i>being another, and there were no ads for the national development plan, no ads from the Government's communications unit and no ads for Project Ireland 2040.  If there were ads in <i>The Echo<\/i>, <i>Southside People<\/i>or any other newspapers covering my constituency, they would show a blank page because there is nothing for the people of Dublin South-West in the national development plan.  I invite people who might be watching or listening to this debate, constituents, to google the national development plan.  They will see a PDF of the national development plan.  If they open the PDF, they can do a word search.  If they search for townlands such as Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Templeogue, Ballycullen, Whitechurch, Ballyboden, Marlay or Greenhills, they will find absolutely nothing.  They will find they are sandwiched between the Luas red line and green line.  This vast swathe of south and south-west County Dublin has been abandoned by Fine Gael and by the Government in the national development plan.  The people who live there are particularly challenged by chronic traffic congestion.  As I mentioned to the Minister the other night, they have sight of the M50 but their access to it is proving impossible.<br\/><br\/>In all the talk of housing and increased density, there is no mention in the national development plan of increasing recreational facilities, which must be a basic standard when we talk about increased housing.  There is no talk of providing additional swimming pools or major parks facilities to service the increased density of housing envisaged.<br\/><br\/>There are a few mentions of Tallaght in the national development plan, such as the renal unit and the intensive care unit in Tallaght hospital, but these projects were initiated by Tallaght hospital itself.  The HSE delayed, and continues to delay, the launch and tender of these projects, and now we find them wrapped up in the national development plan.  The Dublin technological university is relaunched in the national development plan.  It should not be part of the plan.<br\/><br\/>I am quite convinced BusConnects, parts of which I think are only at pre-consultation stage, will not come online for another three or four years as far as its impact on people in my constituency is concerned, but this is all wrapped up and repackaged in the national development plan.  Meanwhile, the Minister's constituency, which already has the Luas green line, will get a metro, and still we have this large gap from Dundrum all along the corridor and right out to Tallaght and everywhere in between.  There is no talk of a spur line.  This does not even have to be a line on track; once it is a segregated, dedicated, exclusive corridor for public transport, I think people would accept it as a mid-term measure.  However, there is absolutely no such measure in the development plan.  As I mentioned the other night, there are no measures for the here and now.  I absolutely accept the need for a national development plan and a national planning framework.  However, what the Government lacks are proposals to deal with what happens between now and when all this infrastructure is built out, which in some cases will take between ten and 20 years.  In the meantime, traffic coming into the city builds up on all the arteries leading into it.  In the 1990s, if one lived in somewhere like Rathfarnham or Tallaght, one could endure the congestion because one saw the M50 physically being built every day.  In the early 2000s, one could endure the congestion because one saw the Luas under construction.  However, it will be a decade before anyone sees a shovel in the ground or earthworks happening in any part of Dublin on any of the projects proposed here, and even longer for some of the critical proposals.<br\/><br\/>To follow on what a previous speaker said about Dublin, as a Dubliner and a Dublin representative - I appeal to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this as a voice at the Cabinet table - the challenge for Dublin is to compete with international cities.  I think everyone pretty well accepts that.  This was one of the reasons behind Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal for a directly elected mayor, so that Dublin could go out and compete with Copenhagen, Barcelona and all the other cities to attract business and investment into Ireland.  What this national development plan sets up is competition between Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, which is the very last thing we want to do.  Dublin and Dubliners have a right to insist and expect that this county and capital will continue to be allowed to fulfil its potential as a destination, a place to do business and a place to attract investment.  However, what the Government has done in the national development plan is to set Dublin up in competition with other cities in the country as opposed to other cities outside the country in attracting competition.<br\/><br\/>There is no mention of big issues for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport such as air pollution along the M50 corridor and some of the other major routes such as the N81 and noise pollution issues in respect of the M50 corridor for people who reside adjacent to it.  These are really significant issues that have not been addressed in the national development plan, and nor has a Government commitment to take the kind of approach to parts of my constituency and other constituencies that are ravaged by drugs and disadvantage been taken in the Government's initiatives regarding the north inner city.  These are just some of my responses to the national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200023#Y00900","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519307700,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on Project Ireland 2040.  The programme of investment set out in the national development plan will result in a comprehensive road, bus and rail network providing a high level of service to all regions of the country, linking all parts.  The planned investment in transport will also prepare for increases in demand.  All this is even more important as the potential risks of Brexit make access to a range of routes to global markets for trade and tourism all the more important.  It is an investment priority to ensure that the existing extensive transport networks are maintained to a high level to ensure quality levels of service, accessibility and connectivity for transport users.  Protecting our vital national assets and keeping them safe and fit for purpose will be key.  While we are planning for the long term, we are also increasing services in the short term and completing an existing medium-term programme of investment right out to 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system both to reverse emerging congestion problems and secure a significant improvement in public transport services.  BusConnects is an investment priority to radically transform the bus system and deliver a step change in performance across our cities.  The benefits of BusConnects will come on stream progressively from 2019.  BusConnects will aim to introduce continuous bus lanes on the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park-and-ride facilities at key locations.  It will also involve major improvements in ticketing and information.  Dublin will pioneer the system and, as the other cities develop transport strategies, investment will also be available for roll-out of BusConnects in the main cities.  Metro link is a key transport investment priority, with indicated funding of &euro;3 billion.  We will consult with the public on metro link, which will serve people from Swords to Sandyford.  Construction will commence after this consultation and approval process, likely to be 2021, with a view to delivering the project by 2027.  The DART expansion programme will focus on delivery of priority elements of the programme using the recently opened rail link under the Phoenix Park.  This includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as resignalling and junction and station changes followed by a programme of electrification to provide high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda, Celbridge-Hazelhatch, Maynooth and Greystones.  Comprehensive cycling and walking networks will be developed in cities under the national development plan.  This programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.<\/p><p> Building on the success of Government's continued investment in the Luas network, we will undertake appraisal, planning and design in the context of expanding the network to Bray, Finglas, Lucan and Poolbeg.  A light rail corridor for Cork will also be appraised for the later stages of the period of the Cork transport strategy.  These appraisals will ensure that we will be ready to expand the Luas where and when it is needed in line with sustained development and increasing demand in these areas.  There is a strong link between investment in public transport and an increased need for operational funding.  This is particularly the case for rural public transport services, which we are also planning to maintain and grow.  This fact is rightly recognised in the national development plan.<\/p> <p> The aim of the national planning framework is to consolidate the growing population in ways that allow efficient public transport systems and more walking or cycling journeys.  This provides meaningful alternatives to the private car, the benefits of which are not limited to reducing CO2 emissions but also include lessening congestion and yielding more liveable towns and cities.  As part of the national development plan, we will introduce more environmentally-friendly buses in Ireland's cities.  Furthermore, investment is earmarked to support the transition to zero emission capable cars.  The bold target of having 500,000 electric vehicles in our national car fleet by 2030 further signifies the extent of our commitment to decarbonise our transport sector over time.  This all adds to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion in our cities and combating climate change.<\/p> <p> The importance of air connectivity for this island nation cannot be overstated.  Ireland is well served by its airports and has a wide range of routes for business, leisure and tourism.  The national development plan includes priority infrastructural improvements at our State airports as well as support for safety and security related projects at the smaller regional airports under the regional airports programme.  The north runway at Dublin Airport is a nationally important piece of infrastructure, where, following a sustained period of recovery and growth, additional capacity is now required.  Dublin Airport served close to 30 million passengers in 2017 and is a key enabler for the Irish economy.  The international connectivity which will be afforded by a new runway is vital to our future prosperity, especially in a post-Brexit environment.<\/p> <p> Shannon Group has plans to invest over &euro;150 million in the coming years.  This includes the construction of a wide-body paint hangar at Shannon Airport and the development of the group's considerable property portfolio to deliver high-quality, advanced commercial property that supports employment in that region.  It will also support tourism in the region.<\/p> <p> The ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes are key international maritime gateways, handling approximately 90% of all goods received.  The national development plan recognises the importance of ports in connecting Ireland to the rest of the world.  Over the next five years, Dublin Port will progress infrastructure investment of roughly &euro;230 million.  The Port of Cork is investing in the region of &euro;90 million and Shannon Foynes Port will be investing approximately &euro;27 million.  This investment will provide additional capacity through increasing the number, size and depth of berths, thereby preparing the ports for increases in ship sizes and frequency.<\/p> <p> Strengthening access routes to Ireland's ports through investment to upgrade and enhance the road transport network to improve journey times remains a Government priority.  For example, the development of the M11 improves connectivity to Rosslare Port in the south-east.  Regrettably, roads funding, like so many other vital public goods and services, has been far less available than anyone would have liked in recent years.  My Department has carried out detailed and robust studies to show what funding is needed to maintain our roads.  This is why I welcome clear recognition in the national development plan of the importance of maintaining our transport network, particularly our roads.  I know that the everyday condition of local, regional and national roads concerns people and businesses in every corner of Ireland, and a commitment of &euro;4.5 billion for local and regional roads has been made under the national development plan.  I am passionate about making our roads safer.  In that context, properly maintained roads are safer roads.<\/p> <p> These are investments in stronger regions, in greater resilience to the impacts of Brexit and in supporting public transport.  Facing into Brexit, it is important that all our transport sectors feed into and complement each other.  Connectivity is the key, connecting more people to more places.  For example, the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road will connect the new development of the Port of Cork at Ringaskiddy with Cork city and the rest of the country.   Similarly, the new N69-N21 will not only relieve congestion from the busy tourist and commuter town of Adare, it will also enhance access to Shannon Foynes Port.  The planned N6 Galway ring road and the N11-M11 from Kilmacanogue will enable better, faster and more consistent bus services.  Of course, the M20 project will substantially complete the Atlantic corridor.<\/p> <p> Tourism will play a key role in strengthening rural economics and communities.  The tourism sector provides employment for approximately 225,000 people throughout the country and contributes significantly to the development of rural areas.  The success of the Mayo and Waterford greenways in particular show the impact that greenways can have on transforming rural communities.  In the period up to 2021, almost &euro;108 million will be allocated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for investment in tourism product development.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to invest in the experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East and in a new brand for the midlands.  Tourism Ireland will continue to invest in capabilities to ensure that Ireland really stands out and inspires and motivates people across the world to visit Ireland.<\/p> <p> Sport plays a key role in improving the health and well-being of our young people in particular and it is vital that we strive to increase sport participation.  The sports capital programme provides funding to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  Allocations under the most recent round of the programme were made at the end of last year, when we allocated a total of &euro;60 million to 1,807 different sporting projects.<\/p> <p> We will continue to invest in key programmes over the lifetime of the national development programme to support our people and our communities, I am delighted that Project Ireland 2040 commits to establishing a new large-scale sports infrastructure fund for larger projects.  The new fund is designed to provide a more structured approach for such funding and &euro;100 million is being provided.  The full terms and conditions of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months.<\/p> <p> The National Sports Campus has been a very successful development at Abbotstown in Dublin.  Its inclusion in Project Ireland 2040 is fantastic and its future planning is an integral part of the development of Irish sport.  Phase 2 of the national indoor arena will be completed next year.  Construction of a national velodrome and badminton centre is due for completion by 2021.  A review of the master plan for the campus's development will be completed this year and will be aligned with wider Government capital planning.<\/p> <p> We are also seeking, by means of the national development plan, to mitigate some of the potential implications of Brexit.  While we cannot determine the exact implications of Brexit with any degree of certainty at this stage, we do recognise that transport connectivity is crucial and that any disruption to our connectivity will impact on our international trade and tourism sectors.<\/p> <p> Project Ireland 2040 sets out a detailed and positive vision for Ireland's transport infrastructure over the next decade.  The national development plan will deliver a greener public transport network that will provide high-quality passenger interchange points, which facilitate convenient transfer between efficient and integrated public transport services that connect all parts of the country.  All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion in our cities and combating climate change.  Following publication, our focus will turn to delivery that achieves value for money for the taxpayer and enables sustained development and growth as set out in the national planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200024#Z00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519308300,"counter":294,"content":"<p>As a rural Deputy, my concern is how Project Ireland 2040 will improve the development of county towns and smaller centres of population, including our villages.  This is a ten-year capital plan for bricks and mortar and a 20-year vision for national development in designing where people will live and work.  I felt a little uneasy when I saw the media hype surrounding the launch of the two documents.  It was as if the Government was trying to convince itself about the merits of these projects, not to mention convincing the electorate.  Six days later, we are back to trying to solve our current crises, namely, those relating to the shortage of housing and the health service.<\/p>  <p>  In our health service, an average of 612 people have been on trolleys over the past four days.  This is equal to the peak number on trolleys on 6 January 2017.  We need to reform our health service through Sl&aacute;intecare, but that is as much about reforming culture, process and management structures as it is about introducing bricks and mortar and building new services and new hospitals.<\/p>  <p>   Planning and projections are, of course, important and there will be no perfect document.  However, I feel that the rush to put this on a statutory footing is ill-judged, especially before it is closely examined.  The plan is very urban centred, concentrating service and infrastructure development in five cities and a few provincial towns of strategic political importance.  Vast areas of rural Ireland will fall further behind in job opportunities and sustainability.  We need balanced regional development but we also need balanced development within our regions.  Rather than having a view of not wishing to spread resources thinly, we should take the view that each citizen should have an equal opportunity to live and work outside urban centres, or at least have that choice.<\/p><p>Connectivity and infrastructure should allow a more even distribution of jobs and people, and not create a number of city states.  Our 19th century county towns need to be rejuvenated, not just as places to live, but also as places to work.  Our villages need to be sustainable and vibrant, but they can only do so if there is employment within or nearby and if farming is supported as a viable career.<\/p> <p> Out of a total of &euro;116 billion, a &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund over a ten year period equates to less than 1% spread over 26 counties.  Other developments in Project Ireland 2040 will indirectly help non-urban centres.  However, an allocation of &euro;1 billion out of &euro;116 billion can hardly be described as balanced or fair, particularly when one compares it the resources going into our cities and major urban centres. <\/p> <p> I listened to the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Ryan, during the last discussion of the plan.  His contribution to this debate extolled the virtue of compact urban living, arguing that Project Ireland 2040 did not go far enough in urbanisation.  He is not alone in this regard.  Rather than create jobs more evenly outside cities, he proposes to bring people into cities and concentrate jobs therein, building urban cores where people live and work to the detriment of rural society.  The Green Party is clearly more an urban Green Party than an inclusive all-Ireland Green Party.  This plan sees rural Ireland as a holiday playground rather than an economic entity which is sustainable all year round.  The Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East need to have people living and working along their paths.  How can they be sustainable if there is not a hinterland and an indigenous population?<\/p> <p> Compact development is the main theme of Project Ireland 2040, concentrating on five major cities for living and job creation.  Adherents to this philosophy will appreciate this plan.  However, if one believes we should be building a society which is more diverse, then this plan is a major disappointment.  Must we always strive to squeeze the maximum efficiency, with no regard to quality of life or a balanced society?  Must we concentrate on our economy rather than our society?  How will citizens afford to buy or rent in high-density centres?  Will they be happy with their quality of life?  I predict that compact urban development in five urban centres will suck the life-blood from our towns and villages, should there be any left in those areas, as many of your young people have already migrated to our cities or emigrated to foreign parts due to the lack of job opportunities.<\/p> <p> The plan does have positive aspects.  The development of green energy is to be welcomed.  Renewable energy projects harnessing natural offshore wind, wave and solar energy are important policy objectives.  The development of functional and practical electric cars is a goal worth pursuing.  Looking at a green future for Moneypoint and all other peat-burning stations is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p> The Minister of Health, Deputy Simon Harris, recently referred to the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the plan to provide 2,600 extra beds.  I note that the population of Ireland is projected to increase by 1,000,000, which is equivalent to the requirement of an additional 2,600 beds.  As such, these 2,600 beds will just allow us to stand still.  Yes, the provision of elective-only hospitals is very positive.  However, we must look at the culture, process and management changes that need to occur in our health service.  That is the core of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is not just about bricks and mortar.<\/p> <p> I welcome the capital programme to provide &euro;100 million for the development of Shannon Group property portfolio and the &euro;10 million sum for the development of the Bunratty visitor centre.  However, developing the infrastructure of Dublin Airport for an overwhelmingly dominant role in air travel is very unbalanced, particularly when the airports of Shannon, Cork and Knock have substantial passenger capacity and potential as aviation hubs.  The proposed M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick, which links the motorway north to Tuam and eventually to Sligo, is essential for the region and is welcome.  I also welcome the proposal to build 3,500 social houses in County Clare as part of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Ultimately, county towns and villages of Clare will depend on what proportion of the &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, which is earmarked for towns with a population of less than 1,000, they can access.  The sum of &euro;1 billion is a fraction of &euro;116 Billion.  When one considers that Metro North will cost &euro;3.2 billion, and probably more, the regional disparity in investment is put in perspective.<\/p> <p> On the positive side I feel Clare is in a strong position to tap into the proposed rejuvenation and development fund.  I hope this fund will synchronise with Clare rural development strategy 2026, which was launched last September by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  Clare was the first county to launch a rural development strategy following the Government&rsquo;s action plan for rural development.  The elected members and the executive of Clare County Council are to be congratulated for developing this plan.  The ten year strategy targets the creation of 4,000 jobs over the lifetime of the plan through the development of community-led social enterprises supported by Enterprise Ireland, the Clare Local Enterprise Office, the Office of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Leader programme and the rural and community support unit of Clare County Council.  Digital hubs will be established at numerous locations throughout the county to support rural enterprise by facilitating e-working, small-scale training and conferencing.  The strategy also targets the development of community-run multi-service centres, which will aim to provide a range of public services such as GP care, postal services, social protection, health care, transport, advice and information from a single building.  Innovative rural transport initiatives, such as a proposed \"rural Uber\", community car-pooling and community bus services such as LocalLink and Clare Bus are also earmarked under the strategy.  Clare County Council will establish a rural community development officer in each of Clare&rsquo;s four municipal districts.<\/p> <p> While the overall population of County Clare grew over the past 30 years, particular rural areas suffered a population decline of up to 35%.  These are areas in the peninsula area of Loop Head and in north Clare.  Depopulated areas lost much of their agricultural and retail employment and gained few jobs in emerging sectors.  Primary school and GP service closures and threatened closure of Garda stations, post offices and banking services have followed this rural depopulation.  It is thus important to note the differences in development that exist between the corridor connecting Ennis, Shannon and Limerick and the rest of the  county.  Project Ireland 2040 must redress this imbalance, and whether this plan has the focus to do so is questionable.  Hopefully, the Clare rural development strategy will redress this imbalance.  The challenges to our farming sector are magnified by the threats of Brexit, the proposed Mercosur trade agreement and climate change.<\/p> <p> Of course there must be a plan to develop Ireland over the next ten to 20 years.  However, this plan is urban-centred and leaves county struggling to have its voice heard over city.  It lacks balance within regions where rural life, while tolerated, is seen as a drain on our economy and can be sacrificed in favour of compact city development.  This is a short-sighted view of our future.  It is unfair and as the plan unfolds I hope that rural Ireland will not continue to be marginalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200025#AA00200","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519308900,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I overlooked advising the House that the Social Democrats and the Green Party have given their allocated time to the Rural Independent Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200026#BB00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519308900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this report.

In fact, I could even say that, to me, the most relevant piece of the 170-page document is a picture on page 45 of a member of my staff, Ms Maureen McGrath, dancing a set at a local festival in Clonmel.

From there on however, the chapters I have been able to read are pretty disappointing.  I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, has highlighted the benefits, or so-called benefits, that the plan has for Cork.  These are only relevant to Cork city.  Consider the possibility of a light rail network to Cork.  Will this extend to the constituency of Cork South-West?  I have been pleading for many years for light rail to come at least as far as Bandon in west Cork.  I doubt this was even considered in this plan.<\/p><p>There are references to improvements in public transport links to our regional cities, but what about our rural areas?  My daughter works in County Longford as a childminder.  Each week she travels from Schull in rural west cork to Longford, which takes 12 hours.  Her journey includes a bus from west Cork to Cork city although I usually drop her to reduce her journey, a second bus from Cork to Dublin and a third bus from Dublin to Longford.  A journey that should takes four hours and 20 minutes according to Google Maps takes 12 hours on public transport.  That demonstrates where we are and where we are going.<\/p> <p> It is refreshing to see our regional cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway getting some attention other than Dublin but areas beyond that have been given little attention.  Dr. Frank Crowley, of University College Cork business school, has published an article on why Project Ireland 2040 is doomed to fail.  I like to support my fellow Corkmen and, although we have different reasons for thinking the project will be unsuccessful, I agree with his conclusion.  The president of Cork Chamber of Commerce argued that the framework acknowledged that it was in the national interest to promote growth outside Dublin to alleviate pressure in the capital and create opportunities elsewhere.  This is certainly something I agree with.  Two nights ago, a Private Members' motion was dedicated to traffic issues in Dublin city and every other day we hear about housing and accommodation pressures in the capital as well as the extortionate cost of living.  It would make sense to alleviate that pressure and enhance rural and under-developed areas, as Mr. Bill O'Connell said.<\/p> <p> In reference to the south west, including my constituency, the report states: \"Many of these rural areas have a high degree of self-containment, operating as significant local employment and service centres for a large rural hinterland.\"  Without the initiative and entrepreneurship of people in west cork, we would be in a sorry state in respect of employment.  Many companies and individuals have created significant employment through the years with little or no Government mandate.  I visited the Ceramicx Ireland factory in Ballydehob recently.  Mr. Frank Wilson and his family have had to fight the fight themselves and they have created between 50 and 60 jobs.  They are dedicated to their work and their community.  However, the Government still offers no help in this regard.  Small business owners, publicans and postmasters are crippled by different taxes and regulations.  Although it is good that Cork city has been earmarked for further development, which will hopefully have a spin-off effect on west Cork, I would have liked more attention to be given directly to the area.<\/p> <p> West Cork is one of the best places in the country for fishing and marine activities, but little or no thought has been given to this sector  I acknowledge a chapter of the report focuses on marine planning but not to the benefit of people in rural Ireland and west Cork, in particular.  More money should be spent on marine infrastructure and on the many small piers and harbours that inshore fishermen operate from.  These little piers and harbours are to be found all along the Wild Atlantic Way.  Do the Government parties not realise what an attraction they are for tourism?  Kids get to take pictures of crab and lobster.  It is not just fishermen that benefit from this; this is what attracts people to these areas.  The tourism revenue generated by this has a spin-off effect on rural communities.  Investing in these activities would provide for real rural development.  The only marine-related interest that the Government parties have in west Cork is the mechanical harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay.  This will be an environmental disaster if it goes ahead.  Such harvesting will kill creatures that are living in the seaweed and fears exist that the seaweed may not grow back.  Unfortunately, the Government parties, in every way, shape and form, are doing their best to support this in spite of everybody in the local community pleading with them to rescind the decision, which they can do.<\/p> <p> Inshore fishermen were not mentioned in the plan.  Does the Government have any interest in them?  They provide great financial assistance to local businesses.  More financial help is needed for inshore fisheries in the form of hardship money, especially during bad weather.  I raised the issue over and over again following Hurricane Ophelia.  Inshore fishermen pay tax the same as everybody else.  The sector received no help from the Government and inshore fishermen were ignored after the hurricane.  If this destruction or devastation happened anywhere else in the world, the Government would rightly send aid.  With the new season fast approaching, fishermen have lost so much gear that they are trying to borrow money to replace it<\/p> <p> I reiterate the comments of my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, earlier about the abolition of town councils.  We have witnessed the disastrous effect on Cork County Council of this decision.  The T&aacute;naiste highlighted the great projects that Project Ireland 2040 will bring to Cork at a breakfast briefing in the city last Monday.  He included the full implementation of the MacKinnon report, which provides for the extension of the Cork city boundary to incorporate Rochestown, Grange, Glanmire, Blarney, Tower and Ballincollig into the city.  This will add approximately 100,000 to its population.  Members of the Rural Independent Group and I highlighted our opposition to this in a motion before Christmas.  There is huge opposition to this on the ground.  The Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il members of the county council opposed it.  Almost everybody in the county is opposed to this but the Government parties will railroad this plan through because it is their idea and no one will stop them.  This is not a surprise because they are not in touch with the common man on the ground.  If they were in touch with their councillors, the plan would be scrapped.  Our motion highlighted the detrimental effect the MacKinnon report would have on the county council areas that are to be moved into the city but it was narrowly defeated.  That was much to the detriment of the people of Cork county.<\/p> <p> Last Monday, the T&aacute;naiste went on to say when addressing business people in the city that he envisions the expansion of the city by another 125,000 residents. I hope it is not intended to extend the city border as far as Bandon.  I do not know where he will find all these people.  Perhaps, we might be lucky and he will extend the border west of the Mizen peninsula or to the Beara peninsula, where rural people have been forgotten.  The Government needs to take the people of rural Ireland into consideration.<\/p> <p> I hope the plan has been rural-proofed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200026#BB00500","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519309500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Not at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200027#CC00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519309500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>It does not look like it.

Project Ireland 2040 is the result of significant consultation both with parties in the House and throughout the country.  Given the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il's national spatial strategy, NSS, it is remarkable to hear many of its members criticising this plan.  Not one of the 22 fastest growing towns in the State between 2002 and 2016 was a NSS gateway or hub settlement.  The strategy did not aid balanced development and there are now greater distances between where people live and where they work.  What Fianna F&aacute;il did, metaphorically or otherwise, was troop every one of its Deputies and Senators into a room to ask them what they wanted for their constituencies and they got it.  That is not a strategy; that is parish-pump politics at its worst.  I represent west Galway and south Mayo and the strategy did nothing for Galway or the west.<\/p><p>There was no investment in transport, housing or health, nothing.  I am happy to outline some of what this Government's plan will do, not only for Galway but for the region.  Our plan will provide funding for the Galway city ring road.  This will provide relief from traffic congestion in order to implement smarter mobility and public transport measures.  The project is currently at design and environmental assessment phase.  A new elective hospital in Galway is also being funded.  This will drastically reduce waiting times for elective surgery, not just for Galway but for the whole of the Saolta hospital group, which stretches all the way from Donegal to Galway and as far east as Athlone.  A new emergency department will be built at University Hospital Galway.  Replacement and further radiation oncology facilities are funded.  There is funding for a new patient accommodation for Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and a new ambulance service base in Merlin Park.  The N50 Moycullen bypass will also be funded, which will reduce congestion in Moycullen and provide a safer route, with better journey times and better journey time certainty that will improve access to the west and in particular to Connemara.<\/p> <p> The technological university for the Connacht-Ulster alliance consortium will get funding for significant new buildings which will be provided to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology, Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology in its bid for technological university status.  The Government is committed to providing &euro;15 million to the European city of culture 2020 project.  There will be investment in national heritage, which includes Coole Park and Connemara National Park in County Galway.  Gaeltacht investment includes the development of tourism facilities in Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n in the Connemara Gaeltacht, investment in the Aran Islands, the development of improved pier infrastructure in Inis Oirr and the construction of new co-operative offices and community facilities on Inis Me&aacute;in.  There is an investment programme for ongoing safety and maintenance and necessary new developments at Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre.<\/p> <p> Towns and villages with populations of up to 10,000 people, places such as Oranmore and Claregalway, along with rural areas, can benefit from a new rural regeneration and development fund worth &euro;1 billion nationally over 10 years.  Under the sports capital programme communities and clubs across Galway and the West including in rural areas can bid for over &euro;100 million in capital funding over the next four years.  A new large-scale sports infrastructure fund of &euro;100 million is being established for larger sports projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amounts available under the current sports capital programme.  That is what the Government's plan will deliver for Galway and the west; not parish pump politics but infrastructural investment in Galway, the west and north-west that has been badly needed for decades.  I absolutely commend this plan to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200027#CC00600","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519310100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>One of the proofs that the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, is on the right track is that it has been criticised by all sides, some extreme, others moderate.  Deputy Lahart, who I have great time for, and yesterday, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said it is not doing enough for Dublin but every other Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher and Deputies Harty and Michael Collins said it is doing too much for Dublin and not enough for the regions and rural Ireland.  That probably means nobody is completely happy but equally that no part of the country has benefitted unduly over the other regions and sectors.  That is a task in itself.  I commend the officials responsible for it, and the Ministers.  It is important that we have a proper planning framework for the future.  I discovered the Buchanan report, published at the end of the 1960s only recently.  Much of what it contained is now contained in this plan.  It referred to places such as Athlone and the need for development outside Dublin.  I welcome the fact that the final copy of this plan seeks to ensure that there are significant centres of population north of that line from Galway to Dublin, which is not necessarily the case already.<\/p><p>Without wishing to criticise Deputy Breathnach, sitting across from me now, the constant criticism made by Fianna F&aacute;il was that there was too much spin, or that its announcement was almost too big.  Deputy Lahart went so far as to produce a copy of <i>The Herald<\/i>to explain that it went too far.  The spatial strategy was released with great fanfare.  I think Martin Cullen was the Minister responsible for it.  As Deputy Naughton pointed out, it was spectacular in its absolute and utter failure to deliver anything.  I accept that for ten years, the economy could not support the ideals of the spatial strategy but it was produced in 2002.  It was there for the best years of the Celtic tiger.  I could show towns and cities including my own, Kilkenny, or neighbouring Waterford, that were listed as gateways and hubs that did not get a damn thing under the spatial strategy.  It did not matter a whit.  Nothing was delivered for Waterford, Kilkenny or Carlow, which was also a hub.  That was partly because the economy did collapse and partly because the plan was completely undermined a few years later by a former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who came into this House one budget day and announced decentralisation, which was really a case of one for everyone in the audience, another plan that was not implemented.  <\/p><p>I am glad this is a long-term plan.  I am the furthest thing in this House from a socialist but the communists thought about long-term economic planning.  It did not work out very well in many communist countries but at least there was a long-term objective, not just the list of what is being done in a Member's constituency or his or her part of a constituency. <\/p><p>This plan states there will be 1 million extra people in Ireland in the next 20 years and 750,000 of them will be accommodated, schooled and transported outside the greater Dublin area.  It beggars belief that anybody could say that objective is anything other than pro-regions and rural communities.  Many of the capital announcements for major headline schemes in the Dublin region have been announced before but are long overdue and are badly needed, particularly in the area of transport.<\/p><p>I am glad that the institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford have been included for funding.  The boards and chairpersons of those institutions are involved in detailed discussions with a view to the establishment of a university in our region.  It is the biggest single game-changer for the south east that we could hope for and aspire to.  Deputy Lahart criticised the spacing out of some proposals over ten years.  That is the way to sustainably build an economy.  It would not be sustainable to start everything contained in the capital plan tomorrow.  We must learn from the lessons of recent history in our economic development.  I commend the framework plan, and the officials and others who have been involved in drafting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200028#DD00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1519310700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Robert Burns, Scotland&rsquo;s national poet in his poem \"Ode to a Mouse\" speaks of \"The best laid schemes o&rsquo; Mice an&rsquo; Men, Gang aft a - gley\".

I expect that we will soon have proper legislative footing under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016.  Project Ireland 2040 is a very ambitious plan for our country.  As many other Deputies have already stated, however, a lot of what is contained in the plan is not new and the plan contains initiatives that have been announced already.

I welcome the plan's national policy objective No. 2 outlining the regional roles including Drogheda and Dundalk to Newry cross-border where networks will be identified and supported in the relevant regional spatial and economic strategy.  I also welcome sections 8.2 to 8.5 of the plan that highlights the importance of the Dublin to Belfast corridor as being the largest economic cluster on the island of Ireland.  This point cannot be overstated.  In this context I hope that the commitments to improve infrastructure will be followed through.  The proposed linkage of a high speed train network between the two capital cities of Ireland in the North and South must be completed.  It is important in the North-South context but in the southern context the proposal to extend the DART to Drogheda is equally as important when we consider the pull towards Dublin where many commuters in Meath and Louth will eventually benefit from that as the years go by.<\/p>  <p>  These improvements in infrastructure are imperative if we are to continue to attract inward investment to the region.  In late 2017 we welcomed 300 new jobs in Dundalk when the medicine packaging company Wasdell Group committed to opening a new 70,000 sq ft plant.  This UK company wishes to retain a presence within the EU.  The attraction of that Dublin to Belfast corridor is crucial to our region, which is equidistant to Dublin Airport and to Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport.  The corridor is important in attracting many people post-Brexit who will just be within a one hour commute from places such as Liverpool and Manchester.  That region can be sold in that fashion to get some benefit from Brexit.  The eastern corridor is a huge growth area, as a potential from Brexit, and it is imperative that infrastructure is provided, not just road and rail but also housing to accommodate a sustainable population growth that will give people a good quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  Providing this infrastructure will include the provision of proper connectivity with high-speed broadband as a basic requirement.  Unless a person had broadband in the last week he or she had no opportunity to even read this plan.  It is a disgrace that not one Member of the House has been provided with a hard copy of the document.  This flies in the face of talking about the fact that many people in the State do not have a broadband service.  As with housing, which I shall address shortly, we can advocate that we will do this, that or the other, yet we cannot solve the broadband, the housing or the health crises in the State.  It is no good talking about master plans if we are not going to deliver them.  The issue around high-speed broadband certainly reflects the lack of delivery by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The plan notes that it will be necessary to prepare co-ordinated strategies for Dundalk and Drogheda at regional and town level to ensure that they have the capacity to grow sustainably and to secure investment as key centres on the Drogheda-Dundalk-Newry cross-border network.  This is very important and I welcome it.  There has been much talk about city status for Drogheda.  Members would all love to have city status advocated for many of our towns, including Dundalk, but it is not about a hierarchy.  In my constituency it is about having the corridor and working it to its best advantage.<\/p>  <p>  In the North-South context it is important and noted in the framework that the implementation be in tandem with the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland.  We need a collaborative approach in developing those opportunities for the eastern Dublin-Belfast corridor.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to protect rural towns and communities and when we consider the plans for the four cities it would appear that there will be a shortfall in funding, which will undoubtedly eat into the majority of the funding leaving larger towns to suffer the deficit.  The national policy objective No. 15 is to support the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth.  As I have said already while speaking on a Topical Issue recently, I would like to see opportunities for those who for traditional and generational reasons have lived in rural areas and that they are allowed to remain in their local areas and build in their local community.  This does not necessarily mean in the village they came from.  It is not their fault the villages expanded.  If they can show a traditional link to the community they should have an entitlement to aspire to build a house in the countryside.<\/p>  <p>  National policy objective No. 32 is to target the delivery of 550,000 additional households by 2040.  Because of this Government&rsquo;s track record on housing to date, I believe this objective is aspirational rather than achievable.  I have said before that an immediate solution to the current housing crisis is to provide for emergency legislation immediately, preventing vulture funds coming in and putting families out of their homes.  Before the banks take their opportunity in advance of any legislation for regulation passing through this House, the only way this protection for families can be put in place is for Members to pass emergency legislation making it obligatory, in a very simple and once-off period of time, for the vulture funds and the banks to give first option to the local authorities on the purchases of those distressed loans, at the same price they are being offered to other people.  The local authority would get a bargain, the State would get a bargain and people could be left in their houses.  I shall give an example of this.  Of the 84 compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, that were done, more than 60 were boarded up bank houses.  The banks did not contest the CPOs, which shows that such a measure is constitutional; the banks did not challenge the local authority on the CPOs.  I have been reliably informed that there are more than 400 such houses spread across the county.  We need to take action now, not in three weeks or three months.  Now is the time.  The local authorities should have first call on purchasing these distressed loan books at the same knock-down price as the vulture funds.  This would prevent many people becoming homeless.<\/p>  <p>  I could refer to the lack of a regional hospital that was promised to the region by many Ministers in the past.  We did, however, get a sop: the plan includes the Ardee ambulance base, which is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Louth's motto in its development plans have often spoken of my constituency as being the best place to live, work and grow old in.  This saying was stolen by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, when he spoke for the country.  That was Louth's motto long before he said it.  This should be reflected in any overall planning.<\/p><p>All we want to see is our children growing up, getting a good education, having a nice place to live and aspiring to grow old.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200029#EE00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519311300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Deputies Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, Imelda Munster and David Cullinane are sharing ten minutes.

In the time available, I will confine my comments to matters relating to the constituency and region I represent, which is Cork.  Obviously, population growth under a plan such as this requires very substantial population growth in and around Cork city in particular.  By 2040 or 2050, the population of the county of Cork will exceed 1 million and the population in and around the metropolitan area of Cork city will increase by more than 125,000.  By 2050, that increase could be up to 500,000.  That is obviously a significant growth in population.  In order to develop that growth, we need to ensure that infrastructure is put in place and that the city is planned in a very strategic way.  Public transport is a crucial element of this and I will return to that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Not just in terms of Cork but also in the context of the south and the south west generally, it is enormously important that we encourage infrastructure which does not rely on the hub-and-spoke model under which all roads lead to Dublin.  We need to be able to link Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  All of those areas need to be in a position to work in concert and to develop as a region.  Crucial to that is the delivery of the M20.  This project has been talked about for a very long time.  There is no doubt that it is a substantial project but I put it to the Minister of State and the Government that, pound for pound, there is not a single road project in the State that has the same potential for economic development and delivery of investment and growth.  We also need to see the delivery of the M28.  It is a very short distance of road but if it is developed properly, it could unlock the potential of Cork Harbour and Cork's ability to trade with the world.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we cannot simply rely on our roads to accommodate that level of population growth.  Even if all of the identified road projects are delivered, and we will have to ensure that they are, it will not be possible to accommodate that level of population growth on our roads.  We need to invest in public transport.  Money has been identified.  We need an awful lot more detail because if it is simply invested in traditional bus services in the short term, I would be concerned that it would not deliver the necessary mode change.  We need to look at rapid transit bus and at light rail.<\/p>  <p>  As a final point, it is absolutely essential that the feasibility study on light rail takes the long view and focuses not just on the city we have now but, rather, on the one we will have in the future.  If it does not take that long view, the outcome of the study could be adverse.  We need to take a long view on this issue and on what Cork needs into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200030#FF00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1519311300,"counter":316,"content":"<p>The Government's national planning framework is big on presentation and was launched with great razzmatazz and gloss.  However, it is short on detail and of information regarding the front-loading of investment.  My home town of Drogheda is given third-tier recognition in the plan.  Many people are of the opinion that this is just lip-service because it does not address what Drogheda needs.  Recognition is all very well but if it is not backed up by a firm plan, commitment to funding for infrastructure implementation and a timeframe for delivery, it could well turn out like most plans and just be an aspirational document that lies on a shelf gathering dust.  Without that commitment to funding for infrastructure and without timeframes for delivery, third-tier recognition adds nothing and is of no substance.  A cynic might say that this was an appeasement to ward off any political backlash that local Government representatives might otherwise have gotten.<\/p>  <p>  We should look at the damage done by this Government over the past seven years.  My home town of Drogheda was stripped of its borough council status, its town clerk and any semblance of the power it once had.  What is the point of designating Drogheda as a third-tier growth centre without defining what that actually means in real terms?  Nobody seems to know.  The plan certainly does not define what it means in any detail whatsoever.  Drogheda has already been strategically placed and identified as part of the M1 economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast.  There is not a peep in this plan about funding for Drogheda's northern cross route.  There is not a peep about city status for Drogheda or about the second rail line that was promised.  There is no mention of development of our port or of investment in jobs or housing.  There is also no mention of investment of any sort for Drogheda or Dundalk in recognition of the fact that we are facing into Brexit and of the impact it will have on Louth as a Border county.<\/p>  <p>  It is very easy to present a plan with promises for the future.  One just has to look at the broadband plan which was announced and then announced again.  The announcement was regurgitated and then the timeframe was extended and extended to such an extent that in many areas of the State it is still nothing more than a promise which was not delivered on.  As I said at the outset, the plan is big on presentation, marketing and PR but it is short on commitments for funding, on timeframes and on implementation.  I have to say that this Government has let Drogheda and County Louth down once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200030#FF00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1519311300,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It is very important that we get this right.  We all recognise that the previous national planning framework and national spatial strategy did not get it right.  We had many hubs and gateways.  If one looks at the south east, where I am from, Waterford was designated as a gateway.  From all of the economic indicators, right across investment in public services, investment in infrastructure, unemployment and employment rates and rates of educational attainment, it is clear that the south east did not deliver and, in fact, underperformed.  We had the highest level of unemployment and the lowest level of employment for a long time, both before and since the recession.<\/p>  <p>  We had the lowest level of education attainment.  There is no university in the region and, while we have a first class institute of technology, record numbers of people in the south east are leaving in order to obtain third-level or fourth-level qualifications and are then not coming back.  We do not have the same level of investment in research and development a other regions because baseline research and development funding is given to universities but not institutes of technology.  While we have had some investment in recent years, such as in respect of the motorway, Waterford simply did not deliver as the gateway.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that, at least on paper, this plan is ambitious for Waterford and that is to be welcomed.  It envisages Waterford being a regional gateway city and massive increases in population and the number of jobs.  There are job creation targets.  The difficulty is in how all of this will be delivered and in whether the capital plan will be forthcoming.  Two big issues are not covered in either the development plan or the capital plan.  One is the regional airport in Waterford.  There is investment in regional airports everywhere except Waterford where money is only provided to stand still.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also no real capital investment for Waterford Institute of Technology or additional funding to allow it and the Institute of Technology Carlow to transition into a technological university.  According to this plan, 90% of all funding for higher education institutions will go into the existing universities while only 10% will go into the institutes of technology.  That will not be good for a region which wants to be front and centre at the table and which the Government wants to be a counterweight to Dublin.  The south east will only thrive, be able to deal with the real difficulties and challenges it faces, and play to its many strengths if Waterford city is the driver and engine of the region.  That is what has to happen.  As Deputy Munster said, we can have all the rhetoric, plans and fine words that we want but unless they are matched with funding, unless the silo mentality which exists in different Departments is ended and unless we have a single plan that can drive real growth and cut across Departments and which is underpinned by real funding, this will simply be another document which is long on aspiration but which will not deliver.<\/p><p>I very much hope that this does deliver for the south east.  I am very optimistic for the region, given the splendid things it has going in terms of wastewater infrastructure, the institute of technology and the motorways.  While we have a lot, there is much we do not have because of Government neglect.<\/p> <p> There is no point in having a national planning framework that aims to increase the population if we do not invest in public services or provide the health capacity that people need.  In the south east, there is a demand for a second catheterisation lab to ensure that patients have access to 24-7 cardiology care.  That has to be front and centre if the population is to increase by 60%.  Some of those people are going to get sick and will need to be treated.  That has to underpin any approach to planning as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200030#FF00700","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519311900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak here again today on the national development plan, having contributed heavily to this process for the past year and a half.  I am also clear that in the organisational structures of the plan, all the relevant stakeholders were consulted and encouraged to engage in the process, as I believed has happened.  There have been over 40 public consultation engagements throughout the country and over 1,000 submissions from elected members, organisations and residents.  The level of public consultation was intense and robust.  I attended over half of those public meetings, which was extremely beneficial to me in respect of informing policy in a sustainable and ambitious format.  None of those public consultation meetings dealt in rhetoric or aspirations.  They were about constructive, informative plans for the future of our country.  As chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, I attended numerous informal private briefings from and formal meetings with the Department, during which the committee submitted its recommendations and observations.  The Department officials have always made themselves available to meet any members of the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Having come from 12 years in local government, I have a vast understanding of the level of work and enormous commitment it takes to produce a development plan for a county, never mind a country.  It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormity of the challenge and the commitment it took to produce an investment plan in tandem with a national planning policy, the likes of which we have never seen before.  I pay particular tribute to a very dedicated team within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, namely, Mr. Dave Walsh, Mr. Niall Cussin, Mr. Paul Hogan, who is in the Chamber and many of their team.  They gave enormously of their personal time to this project and I thank them for all they have done to date.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to many remarks in the past week about the statutory process and whether there needs to be a vote.  I watched the political football going on for the past week.  Just as I am on the pitch, I want to be very clear in the Chamber on my reading of this process.  I sat through the statements on the draft national planning framework.  I chaired joint committee meetings on the draft stage on 18 October, following which we submitted our report.  I remained clear that a vote was not required on the final stage, because I had read the legislation and the framework.  I am also clear about which Deputies were in dispute of this and who spoke or did not speak at the draft stage.  I made it my business to be in the Chamber and to speak on the national planning framework because it is important to me not only as a national politician, but also as someone who wants to be part of the policy that will shape our future as a country, a future that will enable growth in a sustainable and targeted format.<\/p>  <p>  It is now time to move on from this and to get to work implementing the national development plan in the interests of what I believe is the right thing to do.  I want to mention a couple of the reasons I am so supportive of the national development plan.  I have taken part in numerous debates in the past couple of days in which it has been pointed out how big the plan is and how many pages it contains.  There have been references to reheating dinners and to the &euro;1 billion we are spending on rural Ireland.  When I talk to these people for any length of time, I realise they have not read the plan.  If they had, they would be very clear on where we are going as a country and would not just be talking about how many pages are in the document.  Everyone understands the consequences of bad planning of the past - the long commutes, ghost estates and empty town centres.  I do not want to go back over history because our future is far too bright to delay the implementation of this plan.  Project Ireland 2040 is about planning for an Ireland that we know, through evidence we have collated, will grow by at least a million people over the next 20 years.  In respect of growth in employment, nine out of ten jobs have been outside Dublin in the past year and seven out of ten outside the satellite areas of Dublin.  It would be bad politics not to plan and create the environment for such growth.<\/p>  <p>  This is about planning for Ireland's future and not the bad planning of the past, which was built from election to election.  This is about the next 20 years, during which we will need to provide an additional 660,000 jobs and over 500,000 homes.  Some 25% of our population will be over a youthful 65 years and we need to plan for supportive housing.  My colleague across the Chamber, Deputy Declan Breathnach, is very supportive in this area.  We have had numerous conversations about viable supported living for older people in communities.  I know he is very supportive and comes forward with many policies in this area.  We need to provide housing on State-owned land throughout the country for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  We are going to harness and develop further the potential of our tier 1 and tier 2 ports through industry, tourism, marine life, fisheries and climate change.  Ireland's territorial land is ten times greater then that of our island, which gives us vast opportunity and enables us to develop our floating wind farms, turbines and wave energy, all of which will help us transition to a carbon zero economy, harnessing the potential of the region in renewable energy terms across the technological spectrum from wind to solar to biomass and wave energy.  Huge emphasis is being put into consolidating the development of places that grew rapidly in the past decade or so, with large-scale commuter driven housing development with a particular focus on addressing local community and amenity facility provision in many of our larger commuter towns through targeted investment.  We are continuing the transformation of transport and communications by completing motorways, public transport and broadband links that are so badly needed to better connect communities and citizens.  Investment in an integrated transport system that links Dublin Airport is long overdue.  As a former ground staff employee of Dublin Airport, I fully recognise how inaccessible the airport has been in the past.  Also planned are relocations of some of our maternity services and upgrading of our existing hospitals; three new elective units so they are not competing with our main hospitals; investment in primary care, community centres and mental health units, including one in Sligo; and investment in a technical university that will enable growth in education as education underpins growth.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Launched as Project Ireland 2040 in tandem with the national development plan, the finalised national planning framework signals a shift away from the aspirational plans of the past that came after national development plans and were not underpinned by a capital investment plan.  The national planning framework and the development plan are being followed through on by the three regional assemblies, bringing forward complementary regional, spatial and economic strategies, and linking strategic planning and investment at the national level with the physical planning and local economic and community development functions of local authorities.  Formulation of the regional spatial and economic strategies has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Imelda Munster being parochial about Drogheda.  I would be happy to talk at length about D&uacute;n Laoghaire if anybody wants me to.  That is where my allegiance lies.  However, I am also very aware that this is a national plan.  If Deputy Munster is supportive of this plan and supports her local authority, she too can play a role in developing her community and constituency, not with rhetoric but with actual supportive ways of implementing this plan.  She too can be part of the growth of Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the national planning framework will be supported by a &euro;3 billion regeneration and development fund for rural and urban development, and a new national regeneration and development agency.  I could talk all week about the national planning framework plan.  I have had it under my arm, in my car and at home for the last year and a half.  I have been reading it back to front, upside down and inside out.<\/p><p>This is something that I am passionate about.  I have no qualification in planning but I do have vast experience in it.  I can see the massive potential this plan has for my children and their children in this country. <\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the team in the Department for its commitment and dedication, and the enormity of the sacrifice those people have made in the past year to make this plan happen.  The plan is about giving every citizen, young and old, equality of opportunity, quality of life and the potential to succeed in whatever area they want to succeed in.  For that reason I am passionately supportive of this plan, and will do whatever it takes to support my local authority and the Government in its implementation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200031#GG00200","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519312500,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to Deputy Bailey's speech.  There have been a number of speeches in the House on this issue over the last number of days.  I thought that Deputy Bailey gave a fine speech.  She spoke about evidence-based policy and detailed consultations.  I would love it if that were the case.  It was certainly well argued and well intentioned and I would support it, were it not for the unedifying spectacle of a scramble in recent weeks by Government Ministers, Deputies and councillors to somehow allocate funding for their particular regions or areas.  I believe the plan was renamed at the 11th hour for fear that it be considered an urban plan - or perhaps for fear that it be considered a rural plan - because it had to have something for everyone in the audience.  If the plan was based on evidence-based policy, detailed consultation and best planning frameworks, I would be delighted to support it.  However, the evidence to date does not appear to show that this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked through the various aspects of the plan.  I am looking at it from a Kildare perspective, considering what we need and do not have there.  The first reaction from my own constituents, and even from local media, was one of confusion.  There is a long list of projects across the country, and I am familiar with those in my own area.  I imagine that the same applies across this House.  Items such as the Sallins bypass were listed as items to be delivered by 2040, as is the Naas to Newbridge N7 widening.  Multiple other plans are also scheduled to be completed before that date.  Deputy Cassells has been arguing for the Slane bypass for many years, and it is also included in the plan.  My constituents, and indeed my local radio station, KFM, were quite confused and spoke about the plans on the airwaves.  They said that some of these projects are already under way, and that they drive past them every morning.  These projects are well advanced.  Some of them have been going on for ten years, between planning, pre-planning and consultations.  There is confusion and scepticism as to how these projects are part of a new plan, when in fact most of them have already started. <\/p>  <p>  I will return to the subject of connectivity later but I note with some degree of scepticism that the national broadband plan is one of the projects the Government is seeking to deliver.  I wish it well with that project, but it does not inspire confidence.  <\/p>  <p>  On the theme of innovation, I asked a question only a few hours ago of the Minister of Health, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, about Government spending on research and development and on innovation.  Another recent plan, published to much fanfare and heraldry, was Innovation 2020.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy English, put great work into it and was very diligent about it.  Indeed, it is not his fault that the plan he delivered has not been implemented.  Innovation 2020 at this stage is more remarkable because of what is omitted from it rather than its implementation.  The headline target for innovation in that plan was that 2.5% GDP was to be spent on research and development funding.  Figures from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published last week show that not only have we failed to meet the 2.5% - we have spent somewhere around 1.45% - but in fact spending on research and development went backwards last year.  We spent less in 2017 than we did in 2016.  At a time when the Government must have realised that the knowledge economy and third and fourth level education are paramount to ensure continued foreign direct investment, competitive advantage, educating our workforce of the future and attracting talent, capital and investment, it is unforgivable for the State to be going backwards in terms of research and development funding.  In this context it is difficult to have confidence in Project Ireland 2040.  We cannot even manage a project for 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Speaking of research and development, I would like to acknowledge the presence of Jim Sullivan, who is with us today in the Public Gallery.  He is vice-president of global research at AbbVie, which is a very successful multinational pharmaceutical company, which has a long tradition of investment in Ireland.  Indeed, it does some fine work.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of transport, I have spoken about the N7, the Sallins bypass and the local projects in my area.  I want to talk about public transport.  I was in London recently and I used the public transport network, including the underground.  I never fail to be inspired by the connections it has.  There are multiple airports around the city centre.  It has the Circle line, which means that it is immaterial whether one is north, south, east or west.  To go anywhere one merely has to make a couple of connections and the whole thing falls into place.  My constituents in Sallins who work in Sandyford struggle to get there.  It is a hop, skip and a jump between multiple different modes.  If they are lucky they might be able to get a train and then take a couple of Luas journeys, providing it is not travelling through College Green at a snail's pace, as it has been most days this week.  There does not seem to be the integration and connectivity such as that provided by the Circle line in London.  I have long argued for the interconnector.  It was one of the first projects that I advocated when I came into this Chamber two years ago.  I had a Topical Issue debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, shortly after he was appointed on the topic of the DART underground.  It is now listed as one of the projects in the plan.  To my knowledge there are no detailed spending figures available for it.  We do not see any further than a dotted line, which was in previous plans, including in Transport 21 over ten years ago.  My party spent &euro;500 million to advance it, including feasibility studies, bore holes, drilling and compulsory purchase orders, CPOs for certain land works, but unfortunately it remains a dotted line.  I wish the Government well on this because it is absolutely imperative that the project is advanced.  <\/p>  <p>  If we look at education there are grand promises about 90,000 primary school places and many thousands of secondary school places.  Yesterday I debated with the Minister for Education and brought up St. Joseph's school, Kilcock.  It is situated in a building dating from the 1950s.  The school urgently needs a new build.  The town of Kilcock had 1,000 people when it was built; it now has 6,500, and yet it is still struggling with the same school.  It has four permanent classrooms and nine prefabs.  We cannot get the money to pay for a new school.  Immediately after my contribution in the House I am travelling to an emergency meeting with parents in Naas Community College to try to explain why the Government committed to build at the school a number of years ago but the building work has not started yet.  As much as we might wish the plan well, it is very hard to have confidence in these kinds of plans when we cannot deliver today, never mind in 22 years' time.  <\/p>  <p>  I have spoken about higher education and the importance of research and development and innovation to the economy.  Universities are crying out for investment.  They need it in terms of knowledge capital, intellectual capital and research spending.  They are also crying out for facilities.  Bricks and mortar are required.  The programme for research at third-level institutions, PRTLI, was a fund which existed all through Fianna F&aacute;il's tenure in government.  The party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, initiated it in the early 2000s and it continued through some philanthropic investments, which were matched with State funding.  It existed until this current Government took office.  Lipservice is now being paid to it.  There is a trickle of money still left in the programme.  Two and a half years after this Government took office, the university sector has no knowledge or certainty about what will replace PRTLI.  How can the universities construct a new science building, a new laboratory or a new library in the absence of funding?  It is very difficult to talk about education and the need for innovation when we see these kinds of gaps.  <\/p>  <p>  On tourism, I must give credit where it is due and say that the Wild Atlantic Way is a fantastic project.  I had the pleasure of cycling it last summer on my holidays with my family in Mayo.  It is well heralded and successful.  It was so successful that a marketing architect was poached to launch its marketing strategy, namely, Mr. John Concannon.  He is doing spectacularly well.  There are 15 or 16 people in his team, which does nothing except spin for the Government all day long.  I certainly credit him with coming up with the idea for the Wild Atlantic Way.  Unfortunately the Grand Canal Way lingers.  The project to link Naas to Sallins, to Ardclough and into south Dublin would be a fantastic initiative.  It would drive tourism and active living, and all of the positives we are trying to address across the country.  However, it lingers at the end of a very long list of projects.  I have raised this issue recently with a number of officials, and indeed with the Minister for Rural and Community Affairs, Deputy Ring.  I hope that some progress will be made on that.  We would love to see all of these things happen, but when they are not happening today it is hard to see how they are going to happen tomorrow or in 22 years' time.  <\/p>  <p>  On health I would have loved to have seen some kind of technological advancements in the plan, for example a commitment to a national patient identifier or a digital ID, which could transform the health system.  One would imagine it would not be terribly difficult to do but it is part of the problem in terms of the disconnected approach that exists at the moment.  These are the kinds of things we would really hope to see.  <\/p>  <p>  On climate change, I understand there is a significant amount of climate change spending in the plan, which is to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>However, the Government argued trenchantly against the Climate Emergency Measures Bill only a week ago because it cannot commit to renewable energy generation in the next 20 years.  On the one hand, we are hearing that all this money will be spent and that climate change will be addressed but on the other, the Government came into the Chamber and opposed an Opposition Bill because it said it could not commit to meeting renewable targets.  It is very difficult to understand where all of that is going.<\/p> <p> I wish to talk about governance.  When I was started as a member of Kildare County Council, we could not spend &euro;10,000 on a road without oversight by the senior engineer, consultation among all the members, a vote in the chamber and a signing-off process.  That was best practice, evidence-based and a good use of public money.  Unbelievably, with regard to the &euro;110 billion, &euro;120 billion or &euro;130 billion of public money - I forgot what is being said now but it is an awful lot of money - there is no governance council or national infrastructure commission such as that called for by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We published a Bill on governance and public spending, which has not been adopted by the Government, and we hear there may not even be a vote on any of these matters.  However, I wish the plan well.  I wish for it to be successful but that remains to be seen.  Past performance certainly is an indicator of future behaviour and past performance is not great in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200032#HH00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519313100,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on what is a hugely significant plan for our country, Project Ireland 2040.  As chairman of the Fine Gael Party, I am immensely proud of the contribution my colleagues in Fine Gael have made to it, from the Ministers sitting at Cabinet - this was very much an all-Government approach by our partnership Government - to our Fine Gael Deputies and Senators.  We had many long, tortuous meetings of our parliamentary party where we discussed at great length all the different aspects of both the national planning framework and the national development plan and how all of that has come together now in Project Ireland 2040.  We did so not because we are parochial about our individual constituencies and counties but because we all care passionately about our country and a development that will be planned and that we will see happen in a structured way.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time in the history of the State, our special plan will be backed up by solid investment in terms of a &euro;116 billion capital plan, all of which will be underpinned by legislation.  That means the plan we put in place will be followed through, that it will be implemented on a day-by-day, case-by-case basis and that it will have money to back it up.  Such an approach should ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past when previous development plans failed to deliver structured development of our country.  Whether it was the bungalow blitz of the 1980s or the sprawl of Dublin during the Celtic tiger years, our country has been failed by not sticking to the plans that were drawn up or working to plans that were more designed on the electoral cycle than on the long-term vision we have introduced here.<\/p>  <p>  For my county of Kildare, the plan is vital.  Due to our mix of urban and rural areas, as the Ceann Comhairle is all too familiar with, and our close proximity to Dublin, this plan is about stopping the sprawl of Dublin, making sure that its density increases to a higher density, that the brownfield infill will happen and that Kildare, Meath and Wicklow do not become suburbs of Dublin.  That is crucial.<\/p>  <p>  For Kildare, a new acute mental health unit for Lakeview is imperative.  Currently, capacity is at 140% in the Lakeview unit.  The then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, allocated &euro;5.5 million to Lakeview in late 2016 for the improvement of the infrastructure in that unit, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware.  However, that would only provide an additional eight beds and a high observation unit.  The point that I and the management made was that this was not enough.  We need to grow the capacity.  As the Ceann Comhairle is all too aware, Kildare people must go to Portlaoise, Tallaght and St. James' hospitals to overflow beds because we cannot cater for those who have acute mental health needs in Kildare, never mind the community support and step-down facilities that are needed also.<\/p>  <p>  A few months after that, I brought the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, to Naas to meet with the senior management in Lakeview, Donal O'Hanlon and Paul Brophy, and the team.  I brought the Minister of State's successor, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to Lakeview as recently as last December to impress upon him the need for a new build.  We now have that in our plan.  That new development is crucial and as you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, the Lakeview unit currently adjoins Naas General Hospital and the ability of that unit to be a new space that could allow us increase the capacity in Naas General Hospital is crucial also.  That represents joined-up thinking.  There is reference in the national action plan, Project Ireland 2040, to 600 new acute beds to be delivered throughout the country by 2040.  We will have an existing building adjoining Naas General Hospital and should be able to deliver that additional capacity much sooner.  <\/p>  <p>  When we talk about our health service, and Naas General Hospital, we need to be aware that the population of Kildare has grown by 100,000 in the past 30 years, so we should not be surprised that there are people on trolleys.  There are massive capacity issues in Naas General Hospital, as there are even today.  The way we address that is by providing those additional beds and additional space, and a key component of that was the endoscopy unit that was announced for Naas General Hospital.  That key element was very close to being delivered in 2011 but was then shelved.  That had a devastating impact on the hospital, our health care services and waiting lists in Kildare.  The endoscopy unit is back on track.  It has planning permission.  It needs to be able to go out to tender.  It has only two years left on its planning permission and I will continue to push for that to be delivered, as I pushed for it to be in this national development plan.  It is a crucial development to ensure that Naas General Hospital's position within the hospital grouping is secured and has a strong foundation into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of our road infrastructure, there has been criticism in the House and in the media of some projects on the list that are progressed.  The idea that we would announce a national capital development plan and not reference the need to widen the M7 motorway or a ring road for Athy is ludicrous.  People would say, \"Where is it?\".  In terms of it being progressed, we are accused by the Opposition that this is a negative development.  However, the fact that we progressed the southern distributor route for Athy during a recession was crucial.  We got that funding when there was no money in the country to bring that road through to planning stage - the planning permission we now have - and within a few months, we will have diggers on site in Athy, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware, because it is something he fought for also.  I will not take any criticism for the fact that the ring road for Athy and the M7 are progressed.  They were progressed when the country had no money.  Imagine what we can do now with a growing economy as we continue to grow jobs and increase development.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the reason there are so many people sitting in their cars on the M7, which we need to widen, is because of the failed policies of the past.  Many constituents from Kildare and Laois commute to Dublin every day.  The ease with which they can get there is important but having locally developed jobs and industry in our area so that all of those people do not have to commute is crucial also.  That is at the heart of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  Other areas such as the &euro;100 million for large-scale sports capital infrastructure development is crucial.  I very much hope our county grounds in St. Conleth's Park, Newbridge, can access some of that money.  It desperately needs a new, modern stand.  We have one of the poorest county grounds in the country but want to have one of the best because we are a very proud GAA county.  I hope that Kildare GAA will benefit from that fund, as will all of the many clubs that have benefitted in recent years from sports capital grants.  The commitment of a sports capital grants in the coming years is also crucial.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in our health sector is telling.  In 2011, no hospitals were being built.  By the time this plan is finished, we will be constructing ten hospitals, three of which are under way already.  That is crucial.  When people talk about waiting lists, it is down to capacity.  It is also down to our primary care centres, planning for one of which in Athy we hope to be applying for very soon.  Those are the developments we want to roll out.  St. Vincent's Hospital, Athy was one of the 90 community care facilities that we also want to see upgraded and its capacity increased.  It should be a building fit for modern day use due to the great care it provides.<\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 covers many different areas.  A rural regeneration and development fund will provide an additional &euro;1 billion.  There will be investment in our towns, villages and outlying rural areas.  That will be on top of existing funding, such as the town and village renewal scheme and all the rest.  The &euro;2 billion urban regeneration fund will significantly benefit large rural towns of over 10,000 people of which there are 41 in the country.  Newbridge, in Kildare, will have the potential to access this funding and that will allow it to be an even greater driver in our local economy and provide the jobs that all the people who live in Kildare need.  They will not have to travel to Dublin for high-quality jobs.<\/p>  <p>  There is a &euro;8.4 billion allocation for a school building programme between 2018 and 2027 to deliver an annual average of 20,000 permanent school places a year.  That is desperately needed.  We need extra provision in school places at second level, in particular for children with special needs in our mainstream schools.  We urgently need progress on the planned extensions to Athy community college, the Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen, St. Conleth's community college and Patrician, Newbridge as well, but the broader issues of future provision beyond that is crucial also.  We need to see progress on that.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has now been given the money to move that on and I look forward to the results of ongoing demographic surveys.  I stay in touch with Department officials and continue to highlight the need for certainty for parents that they will have that provision and those school places about which there is a great deal of anxiety, with which the Ceann Comhairle is all too familiar.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband was mentioned earlier.<\/p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that the 19% of premises in south Kildare which depend on the national broadband plan really need it.  I have been in consultation and raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on the floor of the House within only the past few weeks.  The national broadband plan must be given every chance to work and if it does not, we need a plan B.  The reason we are at 19% is that the national broadband plan has driven the private sector to roll out commercial broadband over the past five years to 74% of premises in the county while in the coming period commercial broadband will be provided to the remaining 7% as part of Eir's 300,000.  The existence of the national broadband plan has driven the &euro;2.75 billion investment by the private sector to roll out commercial broadband over the past five years.  If the plan had not been in existence and if we had not had a tender process, the commercial sector would have been a lot slower to deliver that.<\/p> <p> It is not possible to get to every element of Project Ireland 2040 in the ten minutes I have been given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200033#JJ00200","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519313700,"counter":325,"content":"<p>The Deputy did not do too badly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200034#KK00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1519313700,"counter":326,"content":"<p>He did great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200034#KK00300","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1519313700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I did not even touch on climate change, the measures there and the earmarked &euro;22 billion.

I hope I will be as good as Deputy Heydon and get in as many of my local areas as possible.  It is the second time he did it today.  He did it already with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, when he was discussing family resource centres.  I will approach Project Ireland 2040 from two perspectives with the first being as spokesperson on children and youth affairs for Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I have gone through the plan in depth and I am disappointed.  When we were talking about everything that was going to be invested in schools, I was looking at the mirror of what was going to be done with child care facilities.  We are looking at population growth of the order of 1 million people in the next number of years.  I looked for funding to support urban and rural communities to develop private or community child care facilities but all I can see popping up at me on drilling down into the plan is the &euro;6.8 million which was already put in place and increased this year.  When one applies that among the 26 city and county child care facilities nationally, that equates to &euro;221,000 per annum.  When one divides that further according to the seven tiers of capital funding for which private and community child care facilities can apply, some will get &euro;50,000 and some will get &euro;20,000 and some might be able to amalgamate the two.  In Galway, for example, where there are 225 child care facilities providing full-day services, that means approximately seven projects will be successful.  Nationally, that means seven projects per county will come through on an annual basis, which is disappointing given that counties like Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim are already at 97% capacity and will be looking for capital investment.  We are not talking capital investment of &euro;50,000 or &euro;20,000 in these cases but about &euro;1.2 million or &euro;1.3 million projects to build the centres of excellence required.  Child care services are already being provided in portacabins outside Carrickmacross.  There are a number of child care providers looking for investment nationally, including in Kerry or at Mountbellew in Deputy Eugene Murphy's constituency where there are capacity issues right now.  To get its service over the line, that provider needs &euro;180,000 to put on an extra room to cater for the 26 children who are already using a room in a local national school.  Those rooms can be also used for aftercare.  In that regard, &euro;50,000 is not a great deal of money.  I use that as a particular example.<\/p>  <p>  It would be disingenuous to fail to acknowledge the major projects in health and for hospitals.  The position for every child who will need access to hospitals locally is laid out clearly.  However, in relation to the replacement and refurbishment of the 90 community nursing homes nationally, not one community child care facility was acknowledged in the plan.  A planning application has already been submitted on the Portiuncula ward block.  A lot of people are wondering where it is at.  It is already on the map.  Page 92 of the plan refers to disability services and states that the NDP will continue to support the capital programme for people with disabilities.  I am disappointed it did not refer to \"people and children with disabilities\".  On page 93 of the National Development Plan, child care investment projects are set out and reference is made to ensuing equality and supply of sufficient child care spaces.  Yet again, there is no mention of the buildings child care facilities will use.  The plan refers to the youth services to support and target disadvantaged young people.  We already have a very good DEIS programme but we are still talking about the schools completion programme which was there under previous Governments.  While the programme is excellent, it needs investment.  That can be done here and now and does not need to be under a national plan.<\/p>  <p>  The continued development of ICT and standards for Tusla are mentioned.  Anyone who listens to questions from me to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, every month will know that ICT in Tusla is critical.  We have had many cases in the past 12 months, including the Molly case and the Grace case, and we all know it was down to paperwork.  Unless we have in place the proper infrastructure for people to do their day's work, we are at nothing.  There must be accountability and traceability and we must invest in technology.  We should not be talking just about technology today, we should be talking about upgrading it and moving away from the pen and paper.  Oberstown has been on the agenda since I arrived in the House.  Only &euro;1 million was left to be spent there this year.  One questioned in the beginning whether it was a suitable site because it was being governed by the OPW.  It is down to doors at this stage, I understand.  I wonder why Oberstown is still on the agenda.  I spoke about the &euro;6.8 million which does not hit the mark at all.<\/p>  <p>  I said at the outset that I would approach this from two perspectives.  I was going to speak as a spokesperson for the first half of my contribution and then get parochial for the second half.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, will be glad to be here to hear about the parochial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200034#KK00700","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1519313700,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned Portiuncula.

The extension of the western rail corridor could increase passengers and tourism.  Why, in the name of God, are we looking for another review of it?  There are people in Tuam who are dying to be like people in Waterford.  They are dying to put in their greenway, not on the line but adjacent to it.  Why can we not carry out the feasibility study to show the beauty and opportunity for rural Ireland in running that from Athenry to Tuam, Miltown and on to Claremorris?  I do not want to remove the western rail corridor; I am talking about putting this adjacent to it.  The space between the two hedges is 90 ft wide and it could be used in this way.  A programme is coming out in a few weeks seeking expressions of interest in greenways.  Is the further review on the rail corridor going to delay it?  It is very disappointing for the people of Tuam who are very ambitious and who want their greenway.  I cannot blame them and in fact I am fully supportive.<\/p>  <p>  CFRAMs is a hot topic for me because I live beside the Shannon on one side and I have the Atlantic in Kinvara on the other side.  I was disappointed when I saw the big projects laid out for the future in Limerick, Tralee, Dundalk, Carlingford and Drogheda.  There is no mention of the Burren lowlands, which project is at engineering stage.  I would have thought the Burren lowlands project would have made it into a plan for the next 22 years as with the gate at Portumna to prevent flooding.  It is the only gap all the way along the Shannon and it is where Emerald Star line comes in.  I look forward to the gate which is a listed CFRAM project.  I do not see it here which is a bit disappointing.  On the other hand, I should be reassured that Athlone is being well looked after.  They will sort out their flooding in Athlone and send it down to Portumna, thank you very much.<\/p>  <p>  Staying with water, the eastern and midlands water supply project is at consultation stage.  What does that mean?  For those listening in, it means the pipe will go the 170 km from Parteen on the lower part of the Shannon basin to Dublin.<\/p><p>It is projected we will have a water crisis in Dublin by 2050.  If I thought this was to assist in addressing some of the issues regarding flooding, alleviating problems on the west coast or helping people in the east, I would be very supportive of it.  However, I do not know if that is the case and we need more communication on that.<\/p> <p> In regard to the greenways project strategy, the project is to be delivered in 2018-19 and includes the completion of the Kildare and Meath sections of the greenway, but it also refers to the Galway to Dublin greenway.  I found that amazing for the simple reason that there has not been much engagement in consultation.  The last time it was decided there would be a greenway going from Dublin to Galway, it hit a road block because the planners drew the map and got the line where it was going to go but they forgot to ask the farmers about the land.  If they are talking about having this finished in 2018-19, what is the position in regard to consultation?  I am very supportive of it but I would like to have an understanding on it.<\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to talk about the marketing of the Shannon.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, referenced this earlier in regard to the development of the lakelands district, of which I am wholeheartedly supportive given how wonderful the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East have been.  However, we are squeezed in the middle, although, to be fair, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is there himself.  It would be wonderful to think this could be done at a fairly lively pace and not be put on the back foot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200034#KK00900","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519314300,"counter":334,"content":"<p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is, at its core, about delivering efficiency.  The Department exists to address the connected challenges of our country, the rural parts of our country in particular, which are being significantly left behind where they need to be in terms of modern telecommunications infrastructure.  We are also, as a country, playing catch-up on our obligations in regard to climate change.  The national development plan gives us a means to deliver on these objectives in a much more comprehensive and fundamental way.  We will continue to use our natural resources in a sustainable manner to drive change, to transform rural Ireland, to support employment and to protect our people and our planet for future generations.  The national development plan is the first plan in a decade and represents a step-change in our efforts to meet our climate objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Some have criticised the plan as not being ambitious enough but, far too often in the past, there have been bold visions that were accompanied by a lack of finance and a lack of authority to implement them.  This is a practical plan with the funding commitment to deliver upon it.  The national development plan commits to expenditure of almost &euro;22 billion for climate action - that is, &euro;1 in every &euro;5 that is being spent over the next decade will be climate-related.  Some &euro;14 billion of this will be investments by our semi-State companies.  With this plan, we are moving from being climate laggards to climate leaders in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The commitments we have set out in the national development plan to further our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient society will also be central to delivery of the national planning framework, which will influence where we live, where we work and how we travel.  The national development plan envisages a radical step-change, with &euro;4 billion on upgrading energy efficiency of our residential commercial and public buildings, including all of our schools built prior to 2008, and &euro;1 billion on rolling out the most energy efficient and climate friendly heating technologies in our buildings.  We will have at least 500,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2030 and we will roll out the charging infrastructure to make this a reality.  We are going to ban non-zero emissions vehicles being sold in Ireland from 2030 and no NCT certificate will be issued for non-zero emissions vehicles from 2045.  We are now explicitly committing to ending the production of electricity from coal at Moneypoint by 2025, becoming one of the first countries in Europe to do so.  We are the first country in Europe to introduce a nationwide ban on the sale of smoky coal.  These decisive actions are ensuring that our children and their children have access to clean air.<\/p>  <p>  Our semi-State companies will collectively spend almost &euro;14 billion over the next decade under the national development plan on renewable electricity investments, smarter meter deployment, grid upgrades and interconnection to cater for the growing demand and to diversify our sources of energy supply.  Solar panels on our homes and community-led electricity and energy products offer a real opportunity for local economic growth.  Project Ireland 2040 is putting our climate ambition into practical action.  The most innovative aspect of the plan will be the establishment of a climate action fund of &euro;500 million to leverage further investment from the private sector to finance our transition to a low carbon economy.  There is also another &euro;500 million in a disruptive technologies fund.  This provides us with the tools to support innovative solutions to our climate and future economic challenges.<\/p>  <p>  We are also putting in place a fund of &euro;1 billion to support provincial towns and rural communities.  This allows people with good ideas at long last to turn them into practical solutions.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy will know, there are 18,000 ha of cutaway bog north of Lanesborough in the Mount Dillon complex.  We intend to reflood that cutaway bog, with the climate benefits this will provide.  It will create one of Europe's biggest wetland parks, with cycleways, walkways and even its own railway.  This fund is very much a \"get up and go\" fund.  It will support communities like Elphin, where people have come together and come forward with an innovative plan, and also Rooskey, Castlerea and Boyle, where communities have come together and decided how they are going to build on the strengths they have in their own towns, and which can now access a fund to do that.  We have been very innovative in doing this in Roscommon and we have shown we can provide that leadership.  There is now an opportunity for other counties and communities across the country to follow our lead and example.<\/p>  <p>  Early implementation will be essential in order that we capture the full climate benefits of these measures and do not store up problems with achieving our targets over the next decade.  The radical step-change represented by the national development plan will need to be matched by efforts in all sectors of our economy.  These expenditure commitments will need to be complemented by taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change.  These are the other three legs of the climate action chair.  The challenge ahead of us on climate is clear.  It is the work of us, as politicians, to bridge the gulf between the global challenge and our national responsibilities, between Ireland's obligations and every single person's responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  What we are missing in our towns and villages across Roscommon, Galway and the other counties of this country is young people.  We see clubs struggling to field teams.  Young people are back at Christmas and Easter and during the summer holidays but every single community deserves to be able to keep local people in their own community.  I had a conversation with Canon Liam Devine, who is in Loughglinn after leaving the town of Athlone.  He told a story about last Christmas and the &Eacute;ire &Oacute;g team in west Roscommon.  On St. Stephen's Day the local team played the emigrants.  Canon Devine, who has a big interest in football, said to them, \"We have a great team this year\", until someone turned around and told him, \"They will all be gone next week\", because it was the emigrants who had won that game.  It is a sad reflection of what is going on right across rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200035#LL00200","speaker":"1234"}]
