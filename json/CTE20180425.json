I will indicate, as I have already to committee members, that those present should put their phones on silent.  Their phones will interfere with the recording equipment in the Houses.<\/p> <p>  The first item is to revisit the committee's report of December 2016 on Garda oversight and accountability and to consider what progress has been made in this area in the meantime, including on the implementation of the committee's recommendations.  Second, we will discuss issues surrounding the recording and classification of Garda homicide figures, including, in particular, the review being conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the classification of homicides and the reasons for the delay in publishing the findings of that review and furnishing a report to the Policing Authority.  Third, we will discuss some ancillary issues which I will not name but which have been flagged to the witnesses and of which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been given notice.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, Assistant Commissioner Orla McPartlin, Assistant Commissioner David Sheahan, Chief Superintendent Brian Sutton, Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, Mr. Liam Kidd, executive director of ICT and Mr. Niall Kelly, head of Garda internal audit service.  Seated behind them are Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications, Superintendent Marie Broderick and Ms Gail Malone.  <\/p> <p>  Before we begin, committee members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Most of the witnesses will be familiar with the privilege reminder.  I draw the attention of our witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the situation with regard to privilege.  They should note they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Before inviting Mr. Finn to make his opening statement it is important, for clarification, to point out that the team presenting this morning is not led by the acting Garda Commissioner, which would have been our expectation.  We only received notification yesterday of the make up of the delegation here this morning.  We understand some media are referencing the acting Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, in this morning's press but I am not personally privy to it.  It would be important to state this at the outset, because this is the second time we have addressed the very important issue of the homicide review, and the acting Garda Commissioner has not been in attendance on either occasion.  I know it is matter of concern to members of the committee and, at the outset, it would be important to clarify whether the acting Garda Commissioner and the deputy Garda commissioner, Mr. Twomey, are indisposed.  We also note the fact Mr. Singh is not here this morning either.  Will the witnesses clarify this for the sake of settling down to the work we have indicated that we would like to address this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#C00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>On behalf of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I will explain that the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, is out of the country and, therefore, unable to attend this morning.

The deputy Garda commissioner, Mr. Twomey, is attending that on behalf of the acting Garda Commissioner, so I am attending here to represent the acting Garda Commissioner.

Certainly I will communicate back to him the concerns of the committee in this regard.  The committee has asked that we cover a number of items today and the breadth of topics requires a larger attendance than normal.  Given the time constraints for this opening statement, I will provide an overview of each matter and my team with me are more than happy to take further questions on the detail in each of the areas.<\/p> <p>  As previously stated, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the investigation of each and every suspicious death very seriously.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand that any death, regardless of whether it is ultimately deemed to be from natural causes, accidental or premeditated, brings significant pain for the deceased&rsquo;s loved ones and, as such, it is vital they are investigated fully and professionally so families can be provided with all of the answers to their concerns.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that each death is recorded accurately on our computer system, PULSE, to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our stakeholders and society at large has the most up-to-date information available on natural, accidental and suspicious deaths recorded throughout the country at any particular moment in time.<\/p> <p>  As previously outlined to the committee in December 2017, a review team was established under an assistant commissioner and includes experienced detectives and civilian members of the Garda analysis service to further examine all homicide incidents between 2003 and 2017.  Under this review, priority has been given to the 41 cases from 2013 to 2015 that were the subject of discussion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the CSO and the Policing Authority.  To progress this review, a senior investigating officer has been appointed and an incident room has been established.  The review team&rsquo;s terms of references have been previously outlined to the committee and they effectively have two bodies of work.  These are to review the classification of each homicide incident in line with the crime counting rules and PULSE data quality, and the review of the standard of investigations carried out, particularly to ensure compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p> <p>  Each of the 41 cases is being subjected to a stringent and robust thematic review looking at a range of issues, including initial response, post mortem, main lines of inquiry, exhibits, charge process and family liaison.  To date, 12 of the 41 cases have been reviewed and two of the 41 cases are before the courts with trial dates set.  Certain commonalities have been identified in the cases reviewed to date, such as the revisiting and upgrading of investigative actions and crime classification on PULSE, which had been overlooked.  The review team has also consulted with a number of external bodies to ensure independent data quality.  These include the Office of the State Pathologist, the Courts Service and coroners' inquests.  As a result of findings to date, the review team has made a number of recommendations for changes to PULSE.<\/p> <p>  Due to the volume of work involved in the in-depth review of the 41 cases, unfortunately it will not be possible to have the work completed by the end of April 2018 as previously outlined.  The review team is committed to completing its work as quickly as possible, while very conscious of the need for each individual incident to be thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed.  We will keep all stakeholders advised on progress on these issues.<\/p> <p>  The Garda ICT department has successfully delivered a number of major projects, such as the TETRA radio communications network, e-vetting, and an automated number plate recognition system to assist the delivery of policing and security services.  This would not have been possible without a comprehensive approach to governance and project management.  In relation to ICT procurement, our focus has always been on procuring IT services that support policing and national security activity in a cost-effective manner.  In line with other public sector bodies, the annual Garda ICT budget is approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  In addition, it is subject to review by the ICT governance board, which is chaired by myself as chief administrative officer, and includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ICT governance board meets on a quarterly basis. <\/p> <p>  When talking about ICT investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is important to put this in context.  Due to the economic downturn and the subsequent decision of successive Governments to reduce funding to the Garda organisation and put in place an embargo on civilian recruitment, the ICT budget was reduced significantly.  Capital expenditure reduced by 50% and operational expenditure reduced by 43%.  In addition, the number of people employed in ICT is significantly lower than in similarly sized public sector organisations across the public service at large.  As a result, in order to maintain critical policing and national security ICT systems on a 24-seven, 365 days a year basis, it was vital that the ICT department had access to external skilled resources.  By their nature, given the range of ICT services to be provided and supported, contracts with suppliers can be very complex.  The skilled resource contract with a company we have referenced previously, namely, Accenture, commenced in 2009.  Initially, it ran for two years with the option to extend for a further two years, which it was.  The contract was further extended since 2013 to ensure the continued operation of ICT services and because the complex nature of the contract meant retendering would be difficult due to the lack of a permanent resource to design and run a procurement competition.  However, over the duration of the contract, the average cost per resource has decreased by 8%.<\/p> <p>  The report by the Garda internal audit service raised a number of issues, which have been addressed or are in the process of being addressed.  As of 1 September 2017, all Accenture staff working under the skilled resource contract are subject to the Garda electronic time recording system.  In December 2017, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the Office of Government Procurement to tender for a new skilled resource contract through open competition.  This contract has been broken into four tenders for different services, namely, service desk provision, IT operations, security and support for the strategic transformation office.  These tenders are at different stages of the procurement process.  Over the past 12 months, the number of in-house skilled resources in ICT has increased, and it will increase further in the coming years.  Increased numbers and skills, combined with new structures in the ICT department, will reduce the level of dependency on external contractors.  On the matter of agreed rates, all rates are contained in the master services agreement and annual project documents.  There are no verbally agreed rates.  In addition, the internal audit service raised the issue of pre-payments.  The decision to apply prepayments is in line with the overall Garda budgeting process and has resulted in a 5.5% discount.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the use of email service in the organisation, as was raised by the Policing Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided a report to it.  Following the issue being raised at this committee in early December 2017, this report was provided to the committee later that month.<\/p><p>It is important to state that this report related to organisational use of email and not email use by any individual within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the issue of ICT security very seriously and operates a robust and secure e-mail service.  Every year, there are approximately 48 million emails sent and received securely on our internal systems.  It was the case, however, that in order to use certain mobile devices provided to personnel, there was a requirement to sign up to an account from a commercial provider to gain security updates for the phone.  It is a standard process operated by the telecommunications industry.  There was not, though, any obligation to use the email account.  Restrictions on the sending of large files over the Garda email system also led to some people, for operational reasons, occasionally using commercial email services.<\/p><p> It is clear that our usage policies relating to email had not kept pace with technological developments.  We have taken a number of steps to address this issue.  Users cannot auto-forward emails from Garda email accounts to commercial email accounts.  Garda desktop users cannot access external email systems.  An updated policy on Internet and email usage is being finalised.  The introduction of a new enterprise content management system will enable the remote access of files from mobile devices via secure access protocols, reducing the requirement to send files via email.  Our mobility project, which is being piloted in Limerick, will securely provide mobile users with access to a range of Garda systems and information.<\/p><p> On the committee's report on Garda oversight and accountability aspects that are under our control, we have implemented a number of measures.  In the context of reducing service level complaints to GSOC, pilots have been run in the Carlow-Kilkenny division to reduce the level of such complaints and in the Pearse Street division to examine ways to resolve such complaints without formal recourse to a GSOC process.  Both pilots have proven successful.  In this regard, Ms Justice Ring has cited the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot as an example of how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC can work together to improve public confidence in policing.  It is intended to extend the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot to all divisions in the south-east region by the end of quarter 2 of 2018 and the Pearse Street pilot to other divisions by quarter 3.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has improved the process for Garda personnel speaking up about issues in the organisation.  We continue to encourage and support anyone who wishes to speak up in the future.  To strengthen our approach in this area, we are currently reviewing our protected disclosures policy in conjunction with our colleagues from the PSNI, and additional protected disclosure managers were appointed by the Commissioner in December 2017.  There are now four protected disclosure managers in the organisation, with a mix of Garda and civilian personnel, male and female, to include staff outside HR to ensure any staff seeking to bring a protected disclosure have a number of managers available to them.  In addition, we are working with Transparency Ireland in respect of training and assistance to protected disclosure managers and the policy holder.  Transparency Ireland is also assisting with the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's existing practices.  In addition, members of the Garda senior leadership team have completed an integrity-at-work training course on whistleblowing and the Protected Disclosure Act 2014, facilitated by Transparency Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  Given the breadth of issues to be considered, colleagues will probably take the lead in individual areas if that is acceptable to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Nugent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Mr. Nugent may field questions as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#E00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nugent for attending again this morning.

There certainly would be discussions at those levels at that board on the broader approach as opposed to getting down into the different elements of individual projects.

Mr. Nugent is making a great deal of play out of the word \"report\".  He has confirmed that he examined emails and stated that his previous response was in the context of a report, in that he was not asked about emails, but about a report, when the intent of the question was clear.  Mr. Nugent was, at the least, economical with the answer.<\/p> <p>  I wish to echo the points that the Chairman made at the outset.  I apologise, though, as I will not be as polite as him.  The absence of the acting Commissioner and deputy commissioner has been noted by the committee.  I do not know when the acting Commissioner decided to go abroad.  Had it been organised for some time, I do not know why that could not have been communicated to the committee secretariat then.  I do not know if it is traditional for deputy commissioners to attend the type of ceremony that is supposedly under way this morning in Templemore.  It is an early time for a ceremony.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, I assume that Mr. Nugent is saying that deputy commissioners always go and that Mr. Twomey was in the book for that.  There are other deputy commissioners and I do not know why they are not present either, but this will not happen again.  There is no point in us listening to an opening statement from the acting Commissioner when information it contains is subsequently challenged by evidence given to the committee and he does not appear to answer questions on it.  That makes our job difficult and it will not happen again.  The next time a meeting is organised, we will attend at any time of the day or night.<\/p> <p>  Regarding homicides, is it correct that Mr. Nugent told Deputy O'Callaghan that he and the acting Commissioner were concerned at the evidence given to the committee by the two analysts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#J01100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Yes.  To be clear, it is important to point out that there are no other deputy commissioners.  There is just one, namely, Mr. Twomey.  Only he and I are at this rank, as it were.  The normal practice is for the Commissioner to attend the conferring ceremony.  He is overseas and, therefore, is unable to attend the ceremony or this meeting.  As a result, Mr. Twomey has attended the ceremony.  However, I hear what Deputy Daly is saying and I will bring the committee's concerns back to the acting Commissioner.

Ms West responded that she was not sure she could conclude that it was just an oversight and that, going by what she had been told and looking at it through her own lens, she would find it difficult to believe.  I also put the question to Ms Josephine Feehily on 21 March and she responded that it was an inadequate document and inaccurate in several respects.  She also said:<\/p><blockquote>I can see where the Deputy is going with it, but I am trying to be fair and think what was in somebody's mind in sending us a piece of paper at 8.30 p.m.  I do not believe, however, that it was an oversight.<\/blockquote> <p>We are trying to understand how this happened, how this document ended up in the public domain at that meeting and presented as though there were no difficulties with it, and how the key office was not consulted and asked to sign off on it.  Ms Galligan and Ms West do not believe it was an oversight and Ms Feehily does not believe it was an oversight.  It has been clearly documented that enormous pressure was put on these two individuals and on Dr. Gurchand Singh to sign off on it over a period of two or three days.  Their work was also being contested, so I want to understand why they were not consulted.  If it was not an oversight, what was it?

I do not have that documentation but my understanding is that a business case on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na said that the number of ICT staff had fallen by almost 40% since 2008.  I think the figure was 37%.  We are talking about skilled ICT staff.  I am not quoting verbatim because I do not have the document but according to some of the language in that document, this presented a very serious threat to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to deal with serious crime and manage security.  How serious a threat is the lack of ICT staff?  I understand that the recruitment embargo impacted upon this fairly significantly.  Is it fair to say that the recruitment embargo was applied in this way as rather a blunt instrument and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have the kind of discretion it would have needed to recruit?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#Q01000","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Again, I did hear the piece but I do not know what specific piece of correspondence it was referring to.  That is an aside.  Garda ICT staff numbers have fallen very significantly.  In many ways, that has led to an over-reliance on contracted resources to fill that gap.  The risk has been mitigated to a very significant degree by that use of resources but we recognise that this is not the way we want to run the operation and that the mix as it stands is too heavily leveraged towards the contracted resources.  For that reason, it is a source of some frustration that the process of getting approval for ICT staff has been quite cumbersome.  There are complexities.  In providing competitions for positions in ICT, we must provide for a mixed competition between Garda members and civilian members.  The regularisation of the terms and conditions of appointment from that have resulted in a significant delay around that issue.  Thankfully, the matter in general terms has been resolved within the last month.

The Policing Authority has taken the decision that those posts should now be filled by Garda staff as opposed to Garda members so they will be principal officer or assistant principal officer posts.

There is no one attesting in Templemore today.<\/p> <p>  I will not go over some of the questions because some have been asked forensically.  Deputy Wallace earlier went through a lot of my questions on IT tendering, IT systems and IT procurement processes and the issue of IT personnel.  I have been through this in the Committee of Public Accounts and I believe it needs an independent investigation to look at what has been going on over the past number of years.  The volume of money is absolutely incredible.  It is warranted and necessary.  It is necessary for the taxpayers of Ireland and also to ensure single points of failure, over-dependence on certain contractors and the processes around that are addressed.  I will not go through all of that because Deputy Wallace has asked many of my questions forensically.  I want to put on the record that I believe it to be the case and I will not stop until it happens because it is absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Mr. Nugent is here.  I agree with him that the attendance of a high-ranking civilian in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is necessary at a committee like this.  The issue we raised before and which came up again with the Policing Authority related to Mr. Nugent's statements regarding his investigation of the previous Commissioner's email and I am still confused about it.  I will give Mr. Nugent the chance to look back on what was said here at the previous meeting, which he attended, and at the Policing Authority's comments which are available in the transcript.  I will ask him to look at both of them and see if there is a contradiction or anything he would like to correct.  From what I understand now, the differentiation is on the basis of a couple of words, in other words on language.  I understand that Mr. Nugent looked at the emails of the former Commissioner.

I appreciate that.  I want to address a matter in the opening presentation.  My colleague raised matters relating to the IT situation.  The document referenced, which was reported by RT&Eacute; recently, on Sunday, 22 April, came from the office of the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, and it was to the finance and resources section of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The witnesses were not aware of the particular document, as they indicated to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  That is the specific document referenced.  It talks about 37% of the in-house IT specialists having been lost over recent years, making a case for a serious situation that continues.<\/p> <p>  In their remarks to us, in their opening statement, the witnesses referenced the same issue but stated that in the last 12 months, the number of in-house skilled resources in ICT - I presume resources means personnel - has increased and will increase, as we would all hope, over the coming years, and that consequently there will be less dependency on Accenture and other outside IT agencies.  The case put by the acting Garda Commissioner's office to the Department of Justice and Equality, with no disrespect to what the witnesses have said to us, reflects more accurately a very difficult situation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The point I am making is that we will be addressing a whole compendium of issues directly to the Minister over the next short period which we have requested.  Rather than seeing this as them and us, we want to be in complement to each other for the key issues where there is a need.  We can reflect on this with the Minister and the Department, who will be coming before us, with a supportive position for the case that has been made.  It is important that we are seen in that light.

My instruction was to downsize and to reduce cost because funding was not available.  At the time, in 2008, there were two chief superintendents, two principal officers and approximately eight assistant principal officers or superintendents - those are the equivalents - at the leadership level.  At the time of publication of the comprehensive review of the staffing needs for ICT, we had one principal officer, two superintendents and two assistant principal officers.  Compared to other big organisations, such as Revenue, while I do not want to pick Revenue out, I have a colleague there and am aware that it has nine principal officers and between 20 and 23 assistant principal officers.<\/p> <p>  Our comprehensive review saw a need for five principal officer or Garda equivalents and 14 assistant principal officers or Garda equivalents.  I am talking to Mr. Nugent about building that.  Since the approval of that document, we have been pushing through the process with the Department of Justice and Equality and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get sanction.  An agreement on sanction came through with regard to principal officers and assistant principal officers.  We are now starting the process of recruiting those people.  There are three principal officers, so two additional officers have arrived in the last year, and we got four additional assistant principal officers in the last year.  That is what Mr. Nugent and the Commissioner are referencing in that we are starting to address the leadership element.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Accenture and consultancy, I look within ICT, where we always had a dependency on pushing it down to the lowest level.  That is where we would pay the least amount, where we depend on outsourced skilled resources, while having people in at the leadership, management and supervisory level as full-time Garda employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Kidd"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>One reason is that work was needed to look at integrating Garda members and civilian members at similar ranks, and the terms and conditions that would apply to competitions that would need to take place.

I also refer to considering whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether these allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I propose to use the briefing prepared by the committee staff, and previously circulated to the committee, to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimate 2018.  I will refer to this briefing by page number throughout the meeting.  The briefing document examines each of the Vote 42 programmes in respect of the 2018 allocations provided at subhead level and any associated high level metrics provided.<\/p> <p>  I propose to proceed programme by programme and subhead by subhead.  At the outset of the consideration of each programme, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to give a high level overview of the programme, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance and related expenditure in respect of each programme in 2018.  If having discussed the subhead within a programme detailed in the secretariat briefing and members then wish to raise issues relating to a subhead not covered in the briefing, they may do so before we move on to the next programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I was listening carefully, even if I might not have appeared to be.

I welcome the new committee members and thank previous members for their contribution in the past.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased, despite some delays, to be able to attend the committee today to discuss the Revised Estimate for the Department for 2018.  The Estimate for this year provides for an overall spend of &euro;231 million plus a capital carryover of &euro;7.7 million.  This funding is spread across a range of programmes dealing with rural development and community development, as well as funding for the Charities Regulator.  The context for this funding is especially important.  Ireland stands at an important point in its development.  We have emerged from a devastating recession, during which unemployment escalated and the quality of life of all of our citizens was diminished.  Having corrected the national economy we have an opportunity to create a long-term and sustainable future for our people, not just in economic terms but in social and cultural terms also.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan and the national planning framework provide the overarching framework for Government policy and investment over the next decade and up to 2040.  These documents set out an ambition for Ireland in 2040, an Ireland where we expect an extra 1 million people will have been added to our population and an additional 660,000 people will be at work.<\/p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 sets a bold vision for national development and identifies ten strategic outcomes to which the Government is fully committed.  The plan is a good one for rural Ireland, with many of the strategic outcomes benefitting rural areas across investment programmes in sectors such as transport, energy and tourism.  The Department has a key role to play in driving progress towards the strategic outcome of strengthening rural economies and communities in the national development plan.  The investments we make through the Department's Vote will be significant in delivering on this objective and enabling and promoting the regeneration of communities the length and breadth of the country.  The announcement of the new rural regeneration and development fund in the national development plan is a tremendous boost for rural Ireland.  It is significant extra funding of &euro;1 billion over ten years, and signals a new approach and new potential for rural areas.  The basis for the Government's investment is to support and realise the full potential of rural communities throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Rural regeneration requires a co-ordinated approach to public investment, getting funding and aligning initiatives to enhance the capacity of rural areas to grow substantially.  We need to be ambitious and innovative in our use of public funding to achieve the best impact for rural communities.  The new fund will provide the means for achieving this.  I am consulting with my colleagues in Government on the establishment of the fund and hope to make announcements in this regard shortly.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious not to intrude excessively into the committee's time to examine the Department's 2018 Estimate, and I would like to allow some time for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to speak, so I will briefly highlight key points on the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate before the select committee sets out the Department's budget for 2018.  Gross expenditure of &euro;231.532 million is budgeted for the Department this year.  This represents an increase of 42% on the provisions in 2017.  Part of the increase is due to the transfer to the Department of the community services programme, which was formerly under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Department's current expenditure provision for 2018 is &euro;144.024 million.  The capital provision for 2017 is &euro;87.508 million.  In addition, provision has also been made for the capital carryover of &euro;7.7 million for 2017, which will supplement the provision in the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate is broken down into three programme areas.  These are rural development and regional affairs, community development and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  The total provision for the rural development and regional affairs programme is &euro;93.384 million.  The purpose of the programme is to promote and make long-term sustainable economic and social progress in rural Ireland.  Key actions include the implementation of the Leader programme, with the investment of &euro;35 million and an additional capital carryover of &euro;5 million; the delivery of a range of rural development schemes, including the rural recreation scheme and CL&Aacute;R, for which almost &euro;19 million has been allocated plus carryover of &euro;2.7 million capital; the town and village renewal scheme, which has an allocation of &euro;15 million for this year; and the local improvement scheme, which has been allocated &euro;10 million.<\/p> <p>  I wrote to the local authorities earlier this year setting out a schedule for the launch of these schemes and community development programmes to allow the local authorities and communities to plan their projects more effectively.  I began launching the schemes much earlier than was the case in the past two years, commencing with the launch of the local improvement scheme in February.  I also launched the CL&Aacute;R programme in March.  The town and village renewal scheme and the rural recreation scheme will be announced shortly.<\/p> <p>  The Department's 2018 Vote provides &euro;133.596 million in funding for a range of community programmes.  Two programmes in particular account for the bulk of this funding.  More than &euro;43 million is provided for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  Last week in Limerick, I launched the 2018 to 2022 programme.  The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  The 2018 allocation will provide for the first year of a new five year programme of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities.  This will allow for the key essential front-line services delivered through earlier programmes to be maintained and further developed.<\/p> <p>  The second major programme is the community services programme, with an allocation of more than &euro;46 million.  This programme provides for financial support to community organisations to deliver services through a social enterprise model.<\/p><p>In February I announced a total of &euro;815,000 in additional funding for 12 social enterprises under strand 3 of the programme.  I expect to be in a position to announce further funding allocations later in the year.<\/p><p> The community development programme provision also funds local community development committees, LCDCs, and public participation networks.  The development of these structures is strategically very important to ensure local voices influence planning and investment decisions at local level.  For example, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is managed and implemented though the LCDCs in each local authority area.  They provide the local knowledge to make sure the SICAP is implemented in ways that address the key issues in local areas.<\/p><p> This is a time of exciting opportunity for the country and I know that members will share my view that, regardless of where people live in Ireland, they should have an opportunity and better choices.  There are many excellent initiatives happening in rural Ireland and communities.  My Department's role is to help to build on these excellent examples of community involvement, job creation and social cohesion.  The Government is committed to ensuring its policies recognise the unique challenges sometimes faced by communities.  Our future investment choices must take account of these challenges.  I am also particularly mindful of the need to ensure funds voted by the Oireachtas are put to use for the purposes for which they are voted.  To that end, I have taken a number of steps to maximise the efficiency of our investment, including direct engagement with city and county managers to ensure more effective and efficient use of funding provided for them.  I know that members will share my desire to improve the lives of people who live in rural Ireland and build strong communities, be they in urban or rural areas.  I look forward to engaging with members in that regard.  <\/p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible to allow for a full discussion on the programmes in place and the funding to be provided by my Department this year.  I am happy to deal with questions members may have.  Perhaps the committee might allow the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, to say a few words on his area, including the Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#B01100","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the select committee.  I am pleased to be able to join the committee in considering the Revised Estimates for 2018 for the Department.  As the Minister has done, I emphasise the importance of the current context and the urgent need for Ireland to put in place on a sustainable basis plans for long-term national development.  I welcome the national development plan and the national planning framework and look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the objectives set out in the plans.<\/p> <p>  During my appearance at the committee last November I set out my responsibilities as including oversight of the works of the Western Development Commission; functions related to the Department's input on rural broadband under the national planning framework; an overview of a number of funding schemes under the community programme; responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority, excluding the appointment of members of the board; and the Control of Dogs Act.  I also have responsibility for the Atlantic economic corridor task force.  In that regard, I am sure the committee will welcome the inclusion of the corridor in the national development plan and the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  On broadband, members will be aware that our goal in the national broadband plan is to achieve 100% coverage of high-speed broadband across Ireland.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is working to progress this objective.  My Department is working with local authorities to ensure there are no local barriers to deployment and identify priority areas for roll-out.  A provision of &euro;2 million has been allocated from the Department for this task in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The Department also has lead responsibility for developing the relationship within the State with the community and voluntary sector and setting the policy framework.  This sector has &euro;12.7 million budgeted for in 2018.  The Department's community and voluntary support programmes provide a cohesive framework of support for the community and voluntary sector by giving support to volunteer centres and volunteer information services nationwide, as well as a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and Young Social Innovators.  The funding for all of these organisations is designed to strengthen and foster voluntarism in Ireland, building strong support for volunteering locally from the bottom up.  That is key to the Department's citizen engagement objectives and supports the spirit of participation within communities.  The scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, SSNO, is a key element of the State's support for the role of the sector.  The SSNO provides multi-annual funding towards the core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide support for those who are disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates provide for an allocation of just over &euro;4.4 million in current funding in 2018 for the Charities Regulatory Authority.  The charities regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  It is an independent authority that was established on 16 October 2014 under the Charities Act 2009 and that now comes within the remit of the Department.  The general function of the regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland so as to increase public trust and confidence in the management and administration of charities.  The regulator is independent in the performance of its statutory functions.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to be working with the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, in the new Department.  I am very conscious of the critical role the Department must play in supporting Ireland's overall national development, especially rural and community development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#C00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524672000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.

There is a carryover of another &euro;5 million, giving a total of &euro;35 million, of which &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million will go to the cost of administration of th programme.  How this is done is one mystery I have yet to solve.  It is considered to be capital expenditure, but it is actually to meet the cost of administration.  That leaves an allocation of about &euro;23 million for this year.  It concerns me that, give or take a few hundred thousand euro, there is a total of &euro;23 million because I understand that at the beginning of the year the Department spent &euro;1.5 million.  It is even more concerning that in the months from February to April total expenditure on projects was &euro;500,000.  I am not blaming the Minister for this because it is up to the companies involved, all of which I understand have been set up.  Only one - Galway East which I presume is up and running - had not been approved tjo receive even &euro;1.  The rest seem to have been approved.  The figure for approvals has gone from &euro;20 million to &euro;29 million.  However, one third of the year has passed and I suspect very strongly that the figure of this year will go nowhere near &euro;23 million.  That is why I asked the Chairman a serious question.  He remembered this cycle last year.  <\/p> <p>  Rather than leave it until after the holidays, sometime between now and the end of June the Minister might have to make a genuine call or what we used to call the cash call.  If the money is not going to be spent to meet demand under the Leader programme, it could be spent more usefully on other things.  When I look at the accurate expenditure figure for LEADER - According to the reply I received to a parliamentary question on 17 April, at the end of March the accurate figure for expenditure under the Leader programme was &euro;2.6 million.<\/p><p>Is the Minister already planning?  In his heart and soul, the Minister might recognise this as not being far off the mark.  It is very likely that if he does not do anything, he will wind up with not all of this being spent.  As the Minister knows, except for local improvement schemes, LIS, the spending of money is slow.  If one waits until September to start checking the money, one will not get out of the door by the end of December.  There always seems to be a concern in the Department that it might bust a bolt in capital expenditure.  That can happen in current expenditure and has to be avoided at all costs.  It is much harder in capital.  Normally, in December, one is actually scrambling around looking for bills to pay but in the event that one arrives on 1 December with all one's bills paid, everything up to date but with the Department out of money, any bill that comes in in December does not have to be paid until January if one so chooses, because there is a 30-day pay period.  There is a great cushion there, as the Minister knows, and there are other devices to shelter the Minister.  What is the Minister's prognosis for the spend on Leader?  Does he really believe he is going to spend &euro;23 million, that is, spending &euro;22 million between now and the end of the year, at the end of November and beginning of December, because the Minister has virtually spent none?  If he is not going to spend it, when is he going to start shifting the money or at least making contingency plans to shift the money and getting other programmes that the money could be spent on?  I have many good ideas for the Minister but we would want some lead-in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#C00600","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>The questions Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked are the questions I would ask about Leader.  Communities are desperate for the funding.  It is not happening.  We have mentioned that here in the past two years.  Every Deputy I know has mentioned it.  The Minister and his predecessor seem to be telling us there is loads of money available.  Why is the money not getting out to the people and the communities?  If there is &euro;23 million to be spent this year, I would ask the same question as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that is, how in God's name is that going to be spent?  As far as I know, the roll-out and procedure was changed and anybody with something between his or her eyes would know that that was a bad move.  It has destroyed the whole thing.  I know there is no point in saying this, and it is water under the bridge.  The bottom line is that as I meet those involved in numerous projects in west Cork over the past couple of years and throughout the country, others are desperately seeking this funding and it is not filtering down to the community.  The only money that I heard of was when somebody told me that our local Fine Gael Deputy had on posted his Facebook page that he was able to get money for a group.  I thought that was the great thing about being on the Leader board, that we never announced who got money.  The Leader company announced who got money.  Now it looks as if the politician will announce that he has got the news from the Minister or such.

When we make the allocations, if it is a community hall or another building, the money has to be spent before it can be drawn back down.  I want to see the money spent.  The Deputy asked a straight question and I will give a straight answer.  He is correct that I will monitor this very closely.  I will be monitoring earlier this year and I will not allow what happened last year to happen.  I give the Deputy a commitment that I will monitor this into June and it certainly will not pass July, and then I will have to start making decisions with regard to going to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see where I can reallocate some of that money.<\/p> <p>  Last year, I looked at capital funding, and the Deputy is correct about it.  It is difficult to get schemes that can draw down the funding this year.  Last year, I brought in the shows, and gave some funding to them, Tidy Towns and the libraries.  I looked at ways in which the capital funding could be spent by the end of the year.  With regard to Leader itself, I will give a simple example.  I will not use the Deputy's constituency but another constituency, Kerry, which has 119 approvals.  If one goes to other counties, there are numbers such as 23, 50, 20, and 15.  The programmes are up and running.  I would hope that we would see more allocations, more groups coming in and more of that funding being drawn down.  As I say, we have the money and we want to spend the money.  There is no doubt but that since January, one can see the spend profile is increasing month to month and we expected that to happen.  On the Deputy's question, I will have to monitor that between now and June and July.  I will be making proposals and have to talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#D00800","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>According to the Minister's figures - not mine - on 15 April, total project payments under the Leader programme were &euro;1.5 million.

With all of the significant costs involved nowadays in terms of consultants, planning, quantity surveyors and the like that did not exist in the old days, &euro;1 million does not count as a large project, but at least it provides something that will still be around in ten or 15 years' time.

We do not want to penalise the local authorities which performed and delivered and we need to deal with the others.  In relation to the town and village scheme, I have to take some of the blame myself, to be fair, on the basis that I did not get it out in time last year.

The Department has carried out a limited number of actions under CL&Aacute;R, which I welcome.  It is time now, however, to start to widen its scope.  It has fantastic potential.  In that regard, I mention two ideas which I know are feasible.  The first is a good scheme because it leverages money.  I refer to the group water scheme top-up grant.  The number of houses which are not on a good and properly regulated group water scheme or on a mains scheme is small.  However, these houses do exist in clusters which are dependent on wells of variable quality.  There was huge demand for the top-up scheme before and we were getting close to dealing with this.  A lot of schemes were nearly ready to go.  This is a slow burner because, no more than anything else, it will not break the bank this year.  If the Minister approved the money this year, it would not be spent until next year.  Will the Minister consider re-instituting that scheme this year to achieve a target of giving everybody in the country, within reason, access to running water at a reasonable cost from either a group scheme or a mains supply?  There are not many houses which are five miles away from any other house but I would accept that such houses might not be included.  The top-up scheme proved very effective at delivering that in the past.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, the Minister of State and the Chairman will all agree about the following.  We have fought for many years to do something on the western rail corridor.  Part of the corridor between Athenry to Claremorris is in the CL&Aacute;R area.  In the context of leveraging funds, I note that nothing galvanises State agencies to take action like throwing a few bob on the table to match their funding.  I understand the cost of doing the route from Athenry to Claremorris is approximately &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million, which is small beer in the context of the billions spent on roads, the Luas and the metro.  Will the Minister consider throwing a few bob on the table under CL&Aacute;R and rural development to put it up to those agencies?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland might meet the Minister about \"The Quiet Man\" station.  We could put historic trains on there to bring tourists down to re-enact John Wayne's role.<\/p> <p>  This would provide a commuter line to Galway also.  The Minister represents Mayo while the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and I represent Galway.  Can the Minister imagine if the train were not to stop at Manulla but continued on to Claremorris, Athenry and Galway to pick up people coming from Westport and Castlebar who wanted to go to Galway?  They could be picked up in either Manulla or Claremorris.  It would mean a proper integrated service in the west, in particular a commuter service into Galway which is going to have 40,000 to 50,000 extra people living there in the next 20 years.  I have often pointed out that the Harcourt Street line closed in 1959 and was sold.  Everybody said there was no population in Dundrum or Cherrywood and it would never be viable.  Within ten years or 20 years at the very outside, which was 1979, there was massive regret that it had been sold.  By 1989, the regret was so great, they had to go back and buy everything again at enormous cost to put back the railway line.<\/p> <p>  The Minister can make this happen.  He has the will, the way and the money.  It would be a strategic project for which he would be forever remembered.  If we had a proper commuter service coming into Galway, which is to say arriving and leaving at the right times, I am convinced we would get very good patronage on the line.  Athenry to Galway has already proved that.  There would also be freight trains from Ballina to Foynes, Cork and Waterford without having to travel along all the railway lines on the east coast.  Those are two ideas for the Minister today and I would like to hear a response.  It is time the Minister with responsibility for rural development showed us something.  He is a year in the senior job.  I accept that he is in a much better position on issues like this now.  Will he at least consider what I say?  I have discussed matters with Bord F&aacute;ilte previously and have no doubt that if the Minister did a bit, it would do a bit too.  It would then be very hard for the big boys in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to say no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#G00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>There are two good ideas here.  I am giving serious consideration to one in circumstances where I have deputations every day on group water schemes.  The Deputy is quite correct that a lot of these schemes were ready to go before the crash which did not then go ahead.  On costs and the local contributions, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v brought that scheme in a number of years ago.  As such, there are a number of group water schemes which would not have been developed but for it.  I have to look at water schemes and I have to look at small group sewerage schemes also.  Because these schemes involve small numbers of people, the local contribution is a big one for them.<\/p><p>It is a big contribution but towns and cities do not have to make an overall contribution.  The Deputy is right to suggest that I should start considering creating a scheme now that can roll on for the next few years because it will be a slow burner.  It takes a while for group water schemes to get started.  Some schemes await funding from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but they also need a bit of help with a top-up.  The suggestion made by the Deputy is good and I will give it consideration.<\/p><p> The other scheme is bigger.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would have to consider it and start the ball rolling.  As Deputies will know, the rural regeneration scheme is coming.  My Department is having discussions with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are analysing schemes such as the Leader programme as mentioned and try to learn from them.  In terms of the western rail corridor, if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, county councils and other State agencies are prepared to provide funding then, as Minister, I would consider the project.

As he knows, if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport knew his Department was putting money on the table it would put it up to that Department to be a lead Department and not one that just says \"no\".  In my view, certainty about money would greatly encourage the Department just as European money used to act as a leverage.  One of the initial hallmarks of CL&Aacute;R was leverage.  In other words, for every &euro;5 million that was spent one hoped to leverage another &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million.  The Group R scheme is an obvious one because for every &euro;1 spent one probably receives five times that sum from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport can choose to say \"no\".  The Minister for Rural and Community Development could make an offer that if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport agreed, his Department would be willing to pay its share.  I suggest &euro;7 million a year over three years of unspent Leader funding would make a very significant input.  I have no doubt that F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be interested in promoting tourism related to the film \"The Quiet Man\".  The Ballyglunin railway station is an obvious project for the west.  Such development would enable tourists to travel by steam train, for example, to the film set and allow them to re-enact famous scenes portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne.  The project would be similar to what is available in Dunbrody, County Wexford.  The project would attract every child in the country and adults could pretend they were only going to please their children.  I definitely think the Minister could get poly-funding for the project; he is the man to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#H00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport does not have much of a record for matching the funding that I have put in place and it is not for the want of my asking.

I know some work has been done in different parts of the country.  An excellent walkway has been built around a lake in Drumshambo, Country Leitrim.  Another project in north Leitrim seeks funding to build a greenway.  A number of projects in different places await funding.  There seems to be a slowness in moving the projects forward as quickly as needed.  Can the Minister ensure these projects will be progressed as quickly as possible?<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said about the western rail corridor.  The project can act as a beacon to emphasise that rural Ireland is coming back to life.  I would like everything that can be done to be done.  As the Minister for Rural and Community Development will know, the big problem for a vast majority of rural Ireland is rural depopulation, decline and people feeling there is no future for them, which we must change.  As I have said many times, the sense of future is really what it is all about.  People want to feel that they have a stake in the place.  Very often people have discovered that what existed in the past has dwindled away.  I live in the parish of Aughavas, County Leitrim.  The local national school has started a programme to encourage new families to move to the area because only three children will start national school next year and just one the year after.  If such decline in the number of children living in the area continues then the three teacher school will close in five or ten years time. <\/p> <p>  No one is moving to the area because there is little or no employment available and, therefore, no sense of a future.  That is the big issue that we need to change.  People can live in rural areas but work 30 miles away.  That is a short commute compared with being stuck in traffic while going to work in cities.  People have a better lifestyle, etc. when they live in rural areas.  The advantages of rural Ireland will only be known to people when we start doing stuff that people can see and proves that the Government and society believe in rural Ireland again.  I accept that the Minister and his colleagues believe in having a thriving rural Ireland.  In order for rural Ireland to survive and thrive we need big flagship projects such as the development of the western rail corridor.  Such projects would provide the Government is serious about investing in rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Group water schemes were mentioned.  I wish to mention group sewerage schemes as they are very important.  In many parts of the country people live within a mile or so of local towns in close proximity and there is great pressure placed on them to have septic tanks.  If an adequate scheme was put in place to provide funding it would be a huge help to the people who live in such areas.  The current scheme is very poor and hard to access. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#H00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>To be fair, Deputy Martin Kenny attended many of launches of our projects.

It is incredible what the project has done for the county and other examples can be found in Longford, Lubgate in Skibbereen, County Cork and Offaly.  Small amounts of funding reap great benefits through, for example, the town and village regeneration programme, the CL&Aacute;R programme and rural recreation programme.<\/p><p>I happened to be in Achill when I was at home at the weekend.  Funding has been received to extend the greenway into Achill.  Businesses all over the country have been lifted.  There is no doubt that the effects of the schemes we have introduced over the past two years are now beginning to be seen.  It is possible to see what has been built and what is in action under these schemes, just as it is under the Leader programme.  Projects like the food hub in Drumshanbo, which was mentioned by Deputy Kenny, are creating jobs and adding to confidence in the environment.<\/p><p> Some communities are great at getting funding under various schemes, including CL&Aacute;R, the town and village scheme and the rural environment programme.  We have to think about the villages as well as the towns.  Small funding gives a big lift to villages.  Bigger amounts of money give a lift to cities and towns.  We have to make sure there is an even spread.  We try to look after the smaller places.  I am pleased with the schemes we have introduced and the jobs that have been created.  I am pleased with the goodwill that exists now.  At last, communities feel that the Government is beginning to give them a bit of support.  The introduction of certain schemes is a sign that the Government is listening to them.  We hope that when the rural regeneration scheme is announced, we will be able to announce a few flagship projects that people will come in and tender for.  We hope the scheme will be announced in July.  All of my schemes will be up and running then.  As I have said, the CL&Aacute;R programme is already up and running and will be closing next week.

While it is good that people are becoming aware that grant aid can be drawn down to avail of the opportunities that exist, it is not all about grant aid - it is also about people being committed to the projects in which they are involved.  I have seen what people in fine communities throughout the country have done after receiving small amounts of funding from the State.  In some cases, those people have raised their own funds or borrowed money.  Their projects are up and running.  Some of the people in question have availed of the social inclusion and community activation programme, the community activation programme, the town and village scheme or the rural recreation scheme.

We need stuff that allows people to make their money in our local areas.  There needs to be a productive economy in rural Ireland.  It should not just be a recreational economy.  That is one of the things that have been missing.  The Minister mentioned the food hub in Drumshanbo, which is an absolutely excellent project that has made a huge difference to the town.  Almost 100 people are working in the hub at the moment.  We need more of that.  A man told me last week that he had been speaking to a food company in the Far East that supplies major hotels in that part of the world.  The company in question is unable to get enough of artisan Irish food like cheese that has a story to it.  The food hub in Drumshanbo is producing the kind of niche products that we need to try to bring into the mainstream to a certain extent.  Such initiatives can bring life back into rural Ireland.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has an opportunity to start to work on this.  One of the problems we have had with successive Governments - I am not blaming the current Government, in particular - is that every Department and every part of the Civil Service seeks to push things along to be done somewhere else.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development has an opportunity to be the person who does not push this issue somewhere else.  He should pull it all in and say we want this to happen in rural Ireland.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, we want to leverage money from somewhere else.  If we are to make that happen, the Department of Rural and Community Development will have to put up the first challenge to everywhere else to come on board with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":648,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.  That is what we are trying to address.  He is right when he speaks about depopulation.  That is why we have the national plan and the capital plan.  That is why the rural regeneration scheme is in place.  This is about targeting communities.  It does not have to be the councils.  We hope community groups, State agencies, chambers of commerce and people will come together if they feel they have a scheme that is worthy of being funded under this plan.  That is what we are looking for now.  As I have said, the rural regeneration scheme will be up and running in July.  We hope to make the allocations sometime before the end of the year.  There will be a drawdown from that scheme early next year.  I am confident that what we are proposing will try to address some of the depopulation we have all over the country.  As we said earlier, that is what the Leader programme is about.

When I was in Boston recently, I was told it is the most modern city in the world.  It has big problems such as unemployment and traffic congestion, just like Dublin does.  When one travels a mile outside Boston, there is no broadband.  The mayor told me that it is a big issue.  It is a big issue all over the world.  Up to 71% of rural Ireland is now going to have broadband.  A scheme that is supposed to get up and running in the coming months will continue the process of getting as much of rural Ireland as possible covered by broadband.  The Deputy is quite correct when he says we need infrastructure like broadband to be rolled out.  We are trying to roll it out.  To be honest, I would have said myself that it is not happening.  I live in a place that does not have broadband.  I will have it in a month's time, not because I am there but simply because it is in the plan and covered by the map.  It annoys me that in places where I do not live, the people who came down the roads did one side of the road because it was covered by the map.  They could have done the other side of the road as well if they were allowed to do so, but they were not.  At least it is happening.  I see it on the ground every single day.  People have been connected to broadband every minute we have spent talking in here.  As I have said, when I was in Boston, the biggest issue was that there is no broadband when one travels a mile outside the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00700","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I would like to ask a question about rural recreation.  I cannot let it go.  I notice that Comhairle na Tuaithe had just one meeting last year.  A report has been done on it.  It is meant to be revised, upgraded or updated.  When it was set up, the main issue was access to the hills.  Two pilot projects that have been in place since 2009 or 2010 were meant to indicate whether the needs of hill walkers would be satisfied if enough hills were opened in a structured and organised way.  There is no need to open all the hills.  If 60% or 70% of hills are open, and if people knew which hills are open, car parks can be created and gates and stiles can be provided so that there is no need to go over fences.  When does the Minister think he can get the liability or insurance issue, which has been the big hold-up in this regard, put to bed?  It is only a contingency issue.  The Supreme Court has ruled again and again that there is no liability if one slips on a rock on a mountain.  The only risk to farmers in such circumstances, bearing in mind that their farming needs would be covered, is not the liability - it is the possibility of them being taken to court and having to spend lots of money defending themselves against cases that cannot be won.  Will the Minister give us some date for the finalisation of the access issue so that all the walking does not have to be concentrated on a few paths, which can lead to hills being worn down?  There needs to be wide access.  We can say \"good luck\" to those who do not want their hills to be open because that is their right.  I believe the vast majority of farming communities actually want hills to be open because they know it is a huge advantage for their families, communities, local GAA teams and all the rest.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the walks scheme, which again is in suspended animation.  Greenways are different.  When we talk about greenways, we revert to the old question of whether the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is going to try to dump this responsibility on the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  If they gave it to the Minister, and the money with it, I would be very happy.<\/p><p>If it retained control and the Minister's Department ended up handling greenways out of frustration, however, it would be unsatisfactory.  The Minister has the walks scheme.  Will he be able to extend it this year and start paying people to maintain walks?  I am not referring to greenways, which have tarmacadam, but the ones across moorland and so on.  The scheme is popular with farmers, provides a great service and is win-win all the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I will take the easy question first, that of the walks scheme.  Actually, it is not easy, but it is one of the better schemes that the Deputy set up and it has worked well.  We have 39 trails and 1,905 farmers involved in the scheme, costing the taxpayer &euro;1.8 million per year.  I told the Deputy during our previous D&aacute;il Question Time that I was hoping to get more walks included in the scheme by the end of this year.  I am committed to doing that.  I will have to provide funding for payments in next year's budget.<\/p> <p>  As to this year's payments, I will need to consider ways and means of increasing the number of walks.  I want to do that because, although the money involved is small, it supports those farmers who have been supportive of the scheme and it has worked well.  I have made clear to my departmental officials that I do not want the scheme to be complicated in any way.  How it works should remain simple.  I need to identify and implement a process to get more walks involved.  I intend to have a number of walks selected by the end of the year and have them in payment for next year.  I will honour the commitment that I made to the D&aacute;il in that regard.  I have made clear to my officials that I want this done, and it will be done between now and the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question is more difficult.  When I held a meeting with the IFA today, that scheme was one of the issues raised.  The IFA has great concerns about it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and other Deputies have been raising it with me for a long time.  The Department is considering ways and means.  The Deputy is aware that the previous Department I happened to be in dealt with a court case involving the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and something that occurred on a mountain.  It is wonderful that the State won the case on appeal.  Otherwise, it would have had serious consequences for walks, trails, etc.<\/p> <p>  We need to consider this scheme.  Alongside my legal advisers, officials in my Department are working to determine whether anything can be done with it.  The Deputy was correct in how he outlined the situation.  If landowners or farmers are allowing people onto their land, why should they have to hire solicitors and barristers if a case goes to court, possibly even the High Court?  The State will have to play its part.  We are considering this matter and I am waiting on that advice.  I am working on it because this issue has been ongoing for a long time and it needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#K00200","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524672000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Before we conclude on this subhead, which covers rural recreation, CL&Aacute;R, the walks scheme and the town and village renewal scheme, my experience in County Clare has been favourable and I have seen the transformative effect that these schemes have on local rural areas.

The Minister has &euro;1 million for broadband.  While broadband is not within his Department's remit, it and roads are the greatest issues in rural Ireland.  Some people are getting broadband while others are not.  What has been done by Eir is fantastic.  For those who have it, 1 Gbps makes them internationally competitive.  I met a manufacturer after he had acquired 1 Gbps broadband.  When he told me that there was only one snag, I threw my eyes to heaven and wondered what it was now, but his only problem was that his customers on the much more populated island across the water could not match what he had.  I asked him was it not a great thing to be able to say that, at the back of the mountain, he had 1 Gbps and they were relying on a lot less.<\/p> <p>  Where this broadband is provided, it is fantastic, but it is driving the 30% of people who are half a mile, 1 mile, 3 miles, 5 miles or 8 miles away mad.  Will the Minister give me a small guarantee today, namely, that we will adopt without messing the same policy to broadband that we adopted to electricity and telephones when they were introduced and that, unlike what happened with water, it will be provided to every house and business in the country?  Fibre is cheaper to roll out than copper.  Let us go for bust and be the first country in the world that decides that every house without exception must be connected to fibre.<\/p> <p>  There is a misunderstanding.  The Minister knows Keel on Achill Island much better than I do.  When the Web Summit came to Ireland, those high worth individuals stayed in Keel for the weekend to get the cobwebs out of their heads after all of the hard business in Dublin.  They did all sorts of mad things like kite sailing on the worst October day.  When high net worth individuals like that and who are into extreme sports go away, a place like Achill is ideal in the sense that it has cliffs, wild seas, surfing, kite surfing, cycling around the island, which these ones did, and so on.<\/p><p>They want the really rugged, hard stuff, but they also want one other thing in those very isolated but very attractive places and that is world-class broadband.  They will stay the extra few days if they have New York broadband at the back of the mountain in Keel.  If it is not there, they will get the hell out as fast as they can.  While broadband is of paramount importance for local people, it is also paramount to attract the high net worth individuals who need constant contact to these places.  They tend to gravitate to west Sligo, to the Achill's of this world.  There are so many good reasons to connect every house, and the more isolated it is, the more important that is, both to the local and to the visitor.  Will the Minister promise that he will make sure that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, will connect every house?  I hope there will be no talk of reaching 90% because 90% of the country leaves out 30% of those who live in rural Ireland because there are so many people in the cities.

We are still in a competitive process and expect contracts to be signed this autumn to allow that to be rolled out.  I fully accept what the Deputy has said about Achill Island.  I am sure he has seen the wonderful plan produced by the community in Achill recently, through Mayo County Council.  It is a wonderful example of a bottom-up approach by a community regarding strategic goals and next steps, and it also lists the organisations and agencies that it is hoped will implement the plan.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the subhead, &euro;2 million is available to promote the roll-out of the national broadband plan and the implementation of the recommendations of the mobile phone and broadband task force.

We also support the development of local digital strategies by local authorities, which is expected to cost &euro;100,000.

They would both be familiar with the small towns in the west with populations of a few hundred people.  Williamstown and Glenamaddy would be examples of what I mean by a small town.  Could we bring in a new initiative under the Tidy Towns competition so that those who paint the front of their houses, for example, could claim back the VAT?  I know it cannot be taken off at the beginning under EU rules but we should give some incentive to people.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, he has promoted the living over the shop initiative, trying to get people into small towns.  However, that has not progressed.  When  one phones local authorities, one finds that it is sitting there, as it were, and there is no direction.  We are left in a quagmire.  If we are serious about revitalising rural Ireland, we need to make sure that we give incentives.  Perhaps the Minister for Rural and Community Development could speak to the Minister for Finance about the possibility of introducing tax incentives, particularly in the context of the current housing problem, to encourage people to come back to live in small towns, thus revitalising them.  Incentives may help with that.  Generally when the middle sized towns are competing with the smaller ones for the same money, there can be a bit of a problem.  Is there anything that we could do for towns with fewer than 500 people in them?  I am talking about small villages really.  Is there anything that the Department could do to kick-start such villages, perhaps through the Tidy Towns structure?  Could something be given to those who do up the shopfront or the house front to give it a lift?  A lot of the smaller tidy towns committees are doing Trojan work but they are battling with the bigger towns.  I do not want to cause a split between different sized towns but I would ask that the Department would give the smaller ones a good leg up.  Generally when local authorities get involved in revitalisation, they pick one or two areas on which they will spend &euro;250,000.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, would be familiar with that in Galway and the municipal districts structure.  It is a good thing.  I am not saying anything against it but it is the bigger sized towns that get the money and the smaller towns and villages are struggling a bit.<\/p><p>In the context of CL&Aacute;R, some of the smaller towns and villages have built a community centre outside of the 50 km zone.  There would be applications going into the Department of Rural and Community Development to lay a footpath up to such centres over a five-year period but some of the local authorities are kicking up and insisting that footpaths must be inside the 50 km area.  Some people have been ambitious and have built a funeral home beside a community centre to incorporate different things.  There might be a school in the village but the community centre or the football pitch might be up the road and teachers have to try to get children up there safely during the day or there might be a cr<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&egrave;<\/font>che at the community centre.

This year is the 60th anniversary of the Tidy Towns competition, and what that competition does for small towns and villages, as well as big towns and cities is a credit to everyone involved.  We do not thank them enough.  We sometimes hear criticism of the committees, their work and the role that they play, but I cannot praise them enough.  I have never met such dedicated people, whether they are in Roscommon, Mayo, Kerry or Cork.<\/p><p>It does not matter because they are committed to what they do, which is why at the end of last year I provided &euro;1.4 million for Tidy Towns committees around the country.  I gave them all a grant.  I distinguished between villages, towns and cities but they were all delighted with the grants they got.  It was only an expression of thanks and appreciation for the work they did.  The money went on projects for this year, which is the 60th anniversary.  I hope GAA, soccer, rugby and athletic clubs, the IFA and all communities will make a special effort this year for the Tidy Towns and clean up rural and urban Ireland for the 60th anniversary.  It is terrible that as we are doing this, there are people dumping every minute of the day.  <\/p><p> On the issue the Deputy raised, I was in east Galway recently.  The town and village scheme gave a place called Woodford &euro;70,000 to do exactly what the Deputy is talking about.  The Deputy is right.  It got &euro;70,000.  The footpaths had not been done in about 40 years.  It gave a lift to the town.  This year, the people there tell me they want to do the other side.  It has given a lift to the community.  They see progress and are delighted to see that at last there is a scheme that helps and supports them.  <\/p><p> We are looking at the other issue the Deputy raised but it is not easy.  I am being honest with the Deputy.  We are looking at a pilot scheme to encourage residents to occupy properties they have.  There are small towns where there were businesses in the past but as a result of the Internet and the way business has grown, shops are closing.  We try to encourage people to go back to live in towns and villages.  We are looking at a pilot scheme.  My officials have had lots of discussions with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are trying to bring in a pilot scheme to give people a grant to do up their properties.  The scheme is not in place yet but its purpose would be to encourage people to go back and live in villages and towns and to repopulate small villages and small towns.  We want to get that scheme running with the town and village scheme.  I reiterate it is called the town and village scheme because sometimes, we forget about the villages.  The Deputy is quite correct that the smaller areas need a small bit of support and a bit of a lift.  That is why in the last round of these projects I asked councils to concentrate on towns and villages, particularly the smaller towns as opposed to the bigger ones, to give them an opportunity to advance and get some funding from these schemes.  It has worked very well.  We probably need more funding, which is something I need to discuss with Government to try to get money for these schemes because they are working well.  I would love to see the pilot scheme up and running.  I would love to pilot it around the country to see what effect it would have on small villages and small towns.  It is something I am working on with my officials and the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Public Expenditure and Reform to try to get it over the line.  We want to put a scheme in place that will not complicate anything.  We are working on it.  I would like to see it happening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#L00700","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>On the issue of town and village renewal, there was a scheme for people who had a derelict house in a town and they could get &euro;40,000 from the council to do it up.

It seemed to miss the point.  The lesson was that some investment has to be put in.  We need a grant where we tell people we will give them a 45% or 55% grant to do up the house.  It has to be a grant of over 55% for a person to be able to borrow the rest and to be able to foresee getting the money back at some stage.  If we do that, a person will spend &euro;40,000 doing up a house.  If the person has a grant of about &euro;25,000, within three months, between VAT, excise duty and income tax returns on the workers who do the work on the house, the Government will probably get most of the grant back.  The money goes back in again and that is before ever talking about the spin-off arising from the activity in the community.  There must be an acknowledgment somewhere that we are not spending money in rural Ireland but are investing money on which we get a return.<\/p> <p>  I know many rural villages.  I live near Cloone in County Leitrim.  It is a small village where the post office closed a few years ago.  There is very little there but there is huge potential.  I live in a rural parish called Aghavas where about 600 people live in rural scattered houses.  There is no town or village.  Next door to it is Gortletteragh which is the very same; there is no town or village.  Half the parishes in County Leitrim are probably like that.  There is no town or village.  We have a huge problem with rural planning where people cannot get planning permission.  If they want to go home and live in their local area they cannot get planning.  I acknowledge that is not the Minister's problem.  <\/p> <p>  I will address the local improvement scheme, LIS, for people living in rural areas.  Many cul-de-sac roads have been taken off the list for some reason or other.  They are no longer local authority roads, which they had been years ago.  The only way in which people can get work done on their road now is through an LIS, in which they would have to put up some of the money themselves.  In County Leitrim, there has been a long list of over 200 and good work was done last year in getting money for it.  Money has been put down.  I see &euro;10 million here on the list for it this year.  We need to get a lot more money put into it.  It comes back to the idea of investment.  When there is investment in a rural area, people feel valued.  That is what needs to happen here.  While the money that is there for it is welcome, it is not nearly enough.  That is the point.  I am sure the Minister and Minister of State will acknowledge it is not enough to cover the number of small country roads that are in that situation.  Many of them lead to a couple of houses up a lane where, for example, there are elderly people living who cannot get home help in.  There are a whole lot of issues that will be affected.  A small bit of investment could make a big difference.  Originally the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was supposed to provide this money and it did not do so.  I welcome that it is coming from somewhere.  It is not nearly enough for the under-investment over the past seven, eight or ten years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#M00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of the &euro;40,000 grant.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The proof that any scheme is working is that there is a major drawdown.  That is why I am looking at this pilot scheme.  There is no point in bringing in any scheme if it is unworkable.  That is why I am looking at this pilot scheme in an effort to target precisely what Deputy Martin Kenny is talking about.  Its purpose is to give a substantial grant to see if a family or family member will go and live in a house.  We will come back with more detail on that scheme.  I am working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on it.  It is something I am looking at.  If we are going to bring in a pilot scheme, it has to be dealt with in a way that it is not too difficult to draw down from the scheme.  The people who are making the application need to be able to match whatever funding is needed.  It is something we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the LIS and I am glad he raised it because I need to put a few things on the record.  I am annoyed with some of the local authorities and local authority members around the country.  I wish to make clear that I do not pick the schemes for the LIS.  I am the person who brought back the scheme.  This Department provided the funding for the scheme.  We do not pick the roads.  I resent some of the remarks from members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael that I am the one who picked the roads because I did not.  We wrote to local authorities and we asked them to send us a list of the schemes in order that we could put them up on the website to make sure the schemes are done.  It is a safety mechanism for the schemes.  The councils select them.  I saw a letter in the paper yesterday commenting on Meath.  Meath had only eight roads.  Meath County Council got &euro;359,000.  What I did with the scheme was that every local authority, big or small, got at least &euro;250,000.  That was the smallest amount they could get and &euro;1 million was the biggest amount they could get.  We only had &euro;10 million.  I did not pick any of the schemes.  There has been no change in the scheme since 2002.  I did not make one change in the scheme.  It was the same scheme and operated in the same way.  I did not interfere with it in any way.<\/p><p>I resent the remarks from people to the effect that I picked them.  Those people do not have the courage or guts to talk to officials in their own councils who make the decisions.  I did not change the rules in any way.  I am glad the scheme is up and running in Deputy Kenny's county and that the council there decided on 11 roads on the basis of the &euro;250,000 allocation.<\/p><p> Again, a newspaper made a comparison between Mayo getting so many roads and other counties.  It was not about the roads; it was about the funding.  The council in Mayo got &euro;855,000.  The council in Cork got &euro;1 million.  Donegal County Council was allocated &euro;884,000 but did not confine the list.  The council sent in a list amounting to &euro;70 million and wanted the Department to pick the schemes.  We are not picking the schemes.  The council has received a letter and if it does not prioritise its roads in the next two weeks, I will reallocate that money later on in the year to the local authorities.  I am not picking the roads and I will not pick the roads.  That is not my job nor is it the job of the Department.  We have no hand, act or part in respect of the roads - I am keen to put that on the record.  It is a matter for the local authorities.  I did not change the scheme from what was in place in the past.

Unless a council can prove absolute justification it might not be a bad idea to put an average maximum cost on a scheme.  There is a temptation in some county councils to subvent other roads purposes by putting up the unit price.  It would be worthwhile thinking about saying to council councils that unless there are exceptional circumstances they will not get a grant of more than X euro per linear metre.

I do not want to see this happening with the funding.  What I will do, and I really mean this, if I have time is look at other agencies in respect of delivering the local improvement scheme.

We might discuss it briefly.  I refer to the Western Development Commission, WDC, under two headings.  There is a fair bit of money under the development heading.  There was a time that the WDC figured in the narrative of supporting businesses in rural Ireland etc.   People ask about supports and nobody seems to know of the WDC.  Has the Minister, Deputy Ring, interacted with it?  I refer to making it a substantial player, now that it has cash.  I refer to the WDC getting into the less developed areas, getting projects off the ground and supporting them.<\/p> <p>  On a second WDC issue, now that Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney is here, I will go back to something I raised earlier.  There is a commitment in the national development plan to look at the western rail corridor.  In any reappraisal of the western rail corridor, will it be possible to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Ross, will be persuaded that the WDC should be part of that and right at the core of any team looking at that reappraisal?  I refer to the WDC being at the monitoring committee overseeing that particular reappraisal.  The WDC has done much research work on development issues, population patterns, and commuting patterns.  It would have a significant contribution to make.  Some of us might worry about the kind of people who might be told to do that reappraisal.  I have seen it happen.

On what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said in respect of the rail review,  it is important that all of the stakeholders are consulted.  There are numerous stakeholders one might not think of who need to be consulted on this, including the Galway Port Authority and the Foynes Port Authority.  The western rail corridor needs to be looked at in light of the Brexit situation.  That needs to be factored in.  The working group that the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is chairing on the Atlantic economic corridor also needs to be consulted.  The terms of reference are important.<\/p> <p>  We must ensure that all of these people are consulted.  Local authorities as well as the WDC and the western regional authorities all have to be consulted.  It is bigger than just a railway link or putting a train on a track from Athenry to Claremorris.  We have to look at the bigger picture.  I hope that the Department of Rural and Community Development will have a major input into looking at and consulting on the whole process.  We must look at the positive  impacts it could have not just to the west of Ireland but for this whole Atlantic economic corridor that we are trying to create.  At this stage, because the review will be starting soon, it is important that there is engagement between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  <\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to say something about the local improvement schemes, LIS.  It was a fundamental positive for the Department of Rural Development.  I congratulate it.  There is a stack of roads that have to be done in every county.  They will not all be done in one year.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, mentioned the number of roads done so far.  That is so many gone off a list that was stagnant since 2010.  People might not realise what it means for rural people and the connectivity it creates.  We have to acknowledge that.  It would be brilliant if we could get the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to do matching funds.  We should engage with it on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#O01400","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I will take the LIS and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, will take the WDC.

There has been a major increase in the roads programme this year.  We need the weather now for local authorities to start getting the work done and to identify where the real needs are in respect of roads.  We have allocated &euro;27 million to the LIS scheme for 1,100 roads.  We will look at it between now and the end of the year and see if we have any further funding to put into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#O01500","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I agree in respect of the enhanced role that is necessary for the WDC.  It is in the Programme for a Partnership Government and we are supportive of it.  We have given it extra roles in respect of the delivery of the action plan for jobs for the west and north-west regions.  It is also represented on the monitoring committee of the action plan for rural development and on the Atlantic economic corridor task force.  At the last meeting,  I think it was last month, in Limerick, we had a brief discussion on one of the sub-committees in respect of transport.  I brought up the issue of the western rail corridor.  One of the initial things I asked to be done was in a compilation of the figures for the existing line from Athenry to Limerick.  I do not believe the true picture is being put out.

I was talking about my own county.  There are people, however, who have an alternative view on this.  I refer to both council level and Oireachtas level.  I have heard numerous people, including colleagues of my own, dismissing the existing phase of the western rail corridor as being a white elephant, a waste of money and that nobody is using it.  That is totally untrue.  I have asked the Atlantic economic corridor task force to look at the existing figures, to be able to put those out and give an unbiased reflection of the reality on the ground.  It is a success story, something that is improving and something that has greater potential to grow and develop.  I have discussed this with the Minister, Deputy Ring, and I would like to see a role for this Department in respect of the western rail corridor.<\/p> <p>  I know Project Ireland 2040 makes mention of this in respect of the rail review.  The Deputy is correct and I believe that the WDC should have a role in that.  Irish Rail, if left to its own devices, might not come up with a result that would be in the interest of the west.  We have to look at something like this not for just today or tomorrow or five years, but ten, twenty and thirty years into the future.  We have to look at the whole issue of climate change, rural regeneration and all that goes with that.  The potential for the western rail corridor is huge.  I am fully supportive and it would be a retrograde step if we lost the line based on a short-term decision on an alternative use that would make it difficult to get it back for rail in the future.<\/p><p>I certainly would support the Western Development Commission having a role in that review.  Has the Chairman had an opportunity to invite representatives of the Western Development Commission to appear before the committee?  I have met the chairman and the chief executive officer, CEO.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, has appointed a new board.  I am trying to organise a date to meet its members in order to put forward some of my ideas and to hear the issues with which they would like to get involved or in which they believe they might have a role and whether the legislation establishing the commission needs to be changed.

It allows the existing maximum dimensional criteria that enable our canal heritage vessels to continue to use the system they were designed for.

We have to have the power to close canals for all sorts of reason, including emergencies, planned events and upgrades, but what we want to guard against is their closure because somebody says it is too expensive to maintain some of the waterways and that we need to close them.

We seek to insert this amendment to protect against anybody who would change the by-law to make it more restrictive.  We are seeking to guard against something a lot of us have seen in our political lives - unforeseen changes in policy.  I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.  It would only reinforce that we maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It would not be a burden on anybody, but it would stop an unforeseen change of policy that would restrict navigation to narrower boats and boats of a smaller draft.  The Minister has made a good case for my amendment.<\/p><p>On the second amendment, what we need to guard against is someone deciding at some stage that maintaining all navigations is too expensive and that there are other things we could do with the money.  The Minister is probably not aware that there was once a plan to close the Grand Canal in Dublin and build a road over it.  That is unlikely to happen now in the city, but it could happen somewhere else, particularly in rural areas, where we are often told things are too expensive.  The Minister is telling us that it will not happen.  Therefore, if she were to accept the amendment, it would not impede anything she intends to do, but it would stop some other Minister in the future who might not be as enlightened as her from closing a canal with the excuse that it could no longer be afforded.  Those of us who live in very rural areas are used to being told that things are expensive, not affordable, that not enough people are using them and that there is not enough demand for them.  Neither of the amendments would impede the current policy of Waterways Ireland, rather they would reinforce it by stating it was the policy, that it would remain the policy and that there would be no change to it.  The Minister has laid to rest any worry that they would have unforeseen consequences.  She is actually saying they would only put into law what was the absolute clear and unequivocal policy, as of today, of both the Minister and Waterways Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#D00900","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":810,"content":"<p>I obviously did not make myself clear.

Putting it on the website is handy but one must keep checking the website as a result.  Moving from the 19th century to the 20th century to the 21st century means one can register with organisations - eurotender is an obvious example - and indicate an interest in all tenders to do with boats or whatever.

The Minister will agree with me that, as a society, we have treated the natural environment poorly over recent decades.  The sea around us has become a soup of plastic.  There has been a massive reduction in the ecosystem and the diversity of wildlife species in it.  We have seen the destruction of the natural environment in many different places.  The Oireachtas has a responsibility to ensure we pass on the depth and quality of natural diversity as best we can to the next generation.  We also have a responsibility to the farmers to ensure they can make a living.  Some of the details in this Bill do not resolve the difficulties farmers have.  We have a responsibility to make roads safe for people.  Local authorities can facilitate this with the cutting of hedges and ditches to ensure road users can get through.  We can achieve those three objectives but not with this Bill in its current format.<\/p><p>This Bill's measures will do damage to the ecosystem and the diversity of wildlife we have.  We have a symbiotic relationship with our environment, being dependent on the ecosystem around us.  Pollinators are one of the great examples of this.  Farming is dependent on the fact that there should be decent numbers of pollinators.  In-depth research in Germany and other countries has shown how there has been a stark reduction in pollinator numbers.  This is an accelerating process and not something which has been occurring for years.<\/p><p>Today, I had the opportunity to accept a petition from several different organisations which hold wildlife in their protection.

This amendment would set a higher standard of protection for some of these animals and extend the protection of them in defined areas.  It would not be throughout the country or in areas which did not have populations of, say, yellowhammers.  It signs us up to the birds directive which states that member states should set out a general system of protection for birds during the periods of breeding and rearing of chicks.

Accordingly, as the birds directive has been incorporated into wildlife legislation, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  The birds directive specifically aims to protect all of the 500 wild bird species naturally occurring in the European Union.  Concerned with their decline, member states unanimously adopted the directive back in 1979.  Habitat loss and degradation are the most serious threats to the conservation of wild birds.  The directive, therefore, places great emphasis on the protection of habitats for endangered and migratory species.  It establishes a network of special protection areas, including all the most suitable territories for these species.  Under the birds directive, every member state must report on progress to the European Commission.  Our last report to the commission for the period 2008 to 2012 was submitted in 2013.<\/p> <p>  The habitats directive was adopted in 1992 to ensure the conservation of a wide range of rare, threatened or endemic animal and plant species.  There are about 1,000 animal and plant species which are protected under the directive.

What Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is raising is not connected to what we are trying to do.  The Bill is about extending the burning time by one month and extending the cutting time in August by one month.  I do not agree with what he said about roadside hedges.  No bird is foolish enough to make a nest on the side of a busy road and every road is busy now.  School buses, plant machinery and cars taking young people to school are up and down narrow country roads.  Birds do not nest in roadside hedges.  I would like these hedges to be cut all year round in the interest of the safety of walkers and cyclists and of people who have valuable cars.  They are trying to get up and down these roads and their cars are scratched and torn.  People's eyes are nearly taken out in the evening walking on these roads.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is trying to obstruct the legislation and is saying we are threatening birds and other wildlife but we have to consider people as well.  People are our priority.  There is so much ado here about safety on the roads and, at the same time, every attempt is being made to prevent us from cutting hedges.  If the Deputy was interested in preserving wildlife and ground nesting birds, in particular, why not deal with the mink, magpies, hawks, grey crows and foxes?  They are the guys that are hurting our ground nesting birds.  It is very, very wrong to suggest that because we want to cut trees overhanging our roads and roadside hedges, we will damage the bird population around the country.  I am sorry that I cannot support the Deputy's argument.  I have nothing against birds but there are other ways to protect them.  The Deputy will not protect them by saying we cannot cut hedges.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is about extending the burning period by one month.  It has been discussed long enough.  The Bill started out with the intention of dealing with the burning and cutting of hedges, especially roadside hedges, for the safety of the people travelling the roads.  I cannot understand why the canals were introduced into it.  Was it to cloud the issue?  The farming population and road users will not put up with the conditions they have to operate under currently.  People cannot get up or down any road because of overhanging trees and so on and something must be done.  There is a lot of talk about stopping a fellow having a pint and a half from driving but what happens when a branch falls off a tree - and it only needs to be the length of someone's arm - and it hits the windscreen of some woman taking her children to or from school and she dies?  A family is left without a mother.  During the last storm, three people were killed in this way.  We need to get real and talk about people.  I was brought up to love animals and all wildlife but we must protect people first and that is what I thought the Bill was about.  The Deputy and his party are entitled to bring another Bill relating to birds before the D&aacute;il but he should not try to obstruct what we are at here today because time is moving on and we need to deal with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#M01900","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>We have a fundamental difference of opinion on the ecology we want to protect and develop in our uplands and among our hedgerows.

My view is this.  If there is a contested scientific issue about how best to develop our ecology in these degrading and in-crisis habitats, I argue that the approach should be scientific and that scientific research is needed, rather than legislation.  I have never seen circumstances where one says we will use legislation as our research tool.  I would have no objection to the Minister saying she was going to engage in a major study of how best to protect these habitats, on which I have strong views.  That the Minister would come in with her hobnailed boots and set out legislation, even with a break-out clause after two years, in my mind, is not the proper approach.<\/p><p>There was consultation which concentrated on the uplands issue.  That is the section we seek to delete in this amendment.  There was a very good submission made by the Irish Wildlife Trust in the consultation process.  In its submission, under the heading of scientific basis, it included a quote from the Ember Project which was carried out on similar uplands in the United Kingdom - I understand on the Pennines.  It looked, on a scientific basis, at the effect of burning on uplands between areas where permission had been applied for and those where it had not.  People were saying the burning was justified on the basis that it was protecting the habitat of grouse.  As I understand it, it was the first time that detailed scientific research and analysis were carried out which showed that there was major environmental degradation, including a change to the water table which had an effect on the stability of the peat bogs in the region, which often led to degradation of the peat boglands.  There are also implications in terms of issues with run-off into water streams.  There is a major effect on insect life, ecohydrology and bird life.  It varies between different species.  That one study alone could be presented as a case for moving away from burning as an ecological management tool on uplands.  <\/p><p>The Irish Wildlife Trust called - rightly, to my mind - for an end to all burning.  I cite as an example George Monbiot, the great English environmental journalist, who has made a real assessment of what is actually happening on these uplands, where we see that the natural state condition has been degraded and denuded of wildlife and that the process could be reversed in a way that would be hugely significant and beneficial in terms of protection and biodiversity.  However, there is none of that in the Government's approach.  There is just a continuation of the current system and an extension of the burning period as if it was ecologically progressive.  I fundamentally disagree and would like to see a much wider, bigger vision for how we could extend biodiversity, store carbon and provide a livelihood for people, particularly in rural areas.  <\/p><p>The Origin Green advertisement, with all of the lovely videos with violin music in the background, runs contrary to the reality that under Fine Gael there is no concern or care for the environment, of which the Bill is a symptom.  There are specific concerns.  The Minister says it is part of a series of protection measures to restore curlew numbers.  I would love to see the scientific papers that would back that up.  We have time between now and Report Stage to have a detailed argument about whether this will be a help in the fight against the extinction of the curlew, which would be of seminal significant importance in dealing with the ongoing and widespread loss of biodiversity we are seeing.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister's contention that this is a positive environmental measure.  We should delete the section and not have any extension of the burning period; we should instead come up with a proper Government strategy for uplands and a different vision for how we could use them that would be in tune with a world facing climate change and shrinking biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#N02600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  It is important to say the legislation does not abrogate the need for the directive.  Birds and animals are and will remain protected.  There was a successful prosecution of a case involving hedge-cutting in Monaghan in February.  I also acknowledge the practicalities mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  <\/p> <p>  On the curlew, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan referred, our expert is Mr. Barry O'Donoghue who has said burning is not suspected as a significant cause of the population decline, given that localised burning was a traditional practice on the hills throughout the time when the curlew and other species such as red grouse flourished in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  It is important, when we discuss issues as important as the natural heritage, that we do not scaremonger and that we do not use hyperbole or emotive language in place of looking at the facts.  To suggest the provisions of the Bill dealing with burning will threaten the conservation status of certain bird or wildlife species is simply not a fair representation of the facts.  Some 14% of the land of the country has been designated under the habitats and birds directives.  Burning in any designated area is an activity which requires ministerial consent.  Another fact is that it is controlled or managed burning.  It is not indiscriminate at any stage or does not occur at any time anybody feels like it.<\/p><p>It is managed burning and it is not indiscriminate.  It cannot be done whenever people feel like it, it but must be done in March, for a defined period, limited to certain regions, and with conditions advised to me by the scientific experts of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Burning in March will only be allowed if it is carried out in accordance with very strict statutory regulations which I will make and which will be designed to protect wildlife and to conserve our natural heritage.  The regulations will limit burning to the current year only.  Under section 22 of the Wildlife Act, it is an offence wilfully to destroy, injure or mutilate the eggs or nests of any bird species.<\/p><p> The provisions of this Bill are on a pilot basis only and have a limited lifespan of two years.

People have been speaking about what happened in Connemara in April and May of last year and suggesting it could become legal if we bring in this law.  It would not become legal and that is for two reasons.  First, it did not happen in March and, second, it was out of control burning that seriously damaged hills against the wishes of local farmers.<\/p><p>Fires on hills almost always start in very dry weather in the warmer months of April, May and June.  If there are uncontrolled burnings and outbreaks of fire for which it is difficult to determine the reason, they do not happen in February and March.  What causes fires?  As the poet Raftery said in Anach Cuan:<\/p><blockquote>M&aacute; fhaighimse sl&aacute;inte is fada a bheas tr&aacute;cht ar<br \/><br \/>an mh&eacute;id a b&aacute;thadh as Anach Cuan.<\/blockquote> <p>When he tries to curse the place where the accident happened, which was not Anach Cuan but Newcastle in Galway, he talks of &quot;Loscadh sl&eacute;ibhe&quot;, which is still the Irish term for a mountain fire.  It happened in Raftery's time but all the birds and habitats survived.  I imagine that a lot of it happened from natural causes and a lot of lessons can be learned from that.  Uncontrolled burning is unacceptable but normally happens in very dry weather.  We have exacerbated the risk of uncontrolled burning by destocking too much, which makes the mountains very woody.  When heather becomes woody it lights and the fire is a lot worse than if it had been grazed.  As we saw in Cloosh last year, when a fire gets out of control, it is very hard to bring it under control because the bog goes on fire after a while.  Many measures to limit this growth reduce the incidence of fire and fire damage rather than increase it.  They also reduce the risk that a small fire becomes a big fire.  February is not much of a month for burning in the Irish climate and nor was March this year, as snow does not burn too well.  There is, however, a better chance of doing controlled burning in March, if that is the best remedy to prevent a much worse catastrophe.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have any statistics on the amount of controlled burning that took place this year, last year or the year before?  Does she have any report of the amount of uncontrolled burning that has taken place in those years and the damage caused in each case?  When such things are measured, it tends to be found that uncontrolled burning is done to control unwanted vegetation and to get rid of woody vegetation from mountains.  This stops the uncontrolled burning from happening through spontaneous combustion or any other method.  There is always a risk of someone coming into a rural area and lighting a fire.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently had the temerity to penalise farmers for hills that got burned last year through no fault of their own, which are under appeal at the moment.  The Department blamed the farmers but we were able to get letters from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stating that no suspicion attached to the farmers, who are shareholders in the commonage, and that they were not being investigated under suspicion of having lit the fires.  It is far from reality to suggest that it is the farmers who are lighting illegal fires on this hills.  It is false ecology to think that this amendment will decrease burning.  It will lead to a much higher risk of burning on the hills on account of all the woody vegetation there will be.<\/p><p>I will not support this amendment.  I am one of the few Deputies present who has had responsibility for hill farms when I was manager of a co-op which had 1,000 acres of hill land rented at one stage.  I lived there and worked for hill farmers for a long time and I know that they hate one thing, which is uncontrolled burning on their hills.<\/p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the curlew.  If we want to protect the curlew where I live, it is not the burning that is the problem.  The biggest challenge we face is that the curlew is a very smart bird.  It nested in the islands in Lough Corrib because foxes cannot swim, but mink can, and mink are playing havoc on the islands.  If we are concerned about this, we should do something about the mink.  It is not controlled burning that is the problem, although nobody can justify uncontrolled burning, and I am opposed to anybody who destroys a farmer's land by uncontrolled burning.<\/p><p>The Minister might give us the statistics on controlled burning and how many hectares of land have been destroyed by uncontrolled burning each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#O00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I will have to get back to the Deputy with statistics and they are primarily something the Garda would have.  I want to be clear that the Heritage Bill is not about illegal burning.  The Deputy is correct about controlled burning and it will greatly reduce the chances of wildfires taking hold in upland areas.  Large areas of unmanaged heather or gorse are not good for biodiversity and provide fuel for wildfires during dry spells, and that is what we saw happening last year.  Storm Emma hit at the start of March this year, and just up the road in Northern Ireland, burning is permitted throughout March, and in upland areas it is allowed up to 15 April.  This Bill would bring us in line with other jurisdictions like Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  There are benefits to managed burning.  The old growth strands of heather and woody stems cannot be managed by grazing, for example.  It helps to create a diverse mix of habitat, both open and closed, a canopy of Calluna or heather, and it is of benefit to species like grouse and the hen harrier for ground nesting.  There would be open areas for grouse for rearing chicks.  New heather growth is essential for grouse rearing chicks, who feed exclusively on Calluna shoots.  Other upland species, such as golden plover, mountain hare, lark and meadow pipits all benefit from the diversity created by managed burning.  Unmanaged burning over long periods, in contrast, results in extensive upland areas seeing irreversible change to habitat.  For example, heather growth would be replaced by purple moor grass, and this change displaces species like grouse and the hen harrier.<\/p> <p>  Burning during the months of April, May and June will destroy all ground-nesting birds and their chicks, and small mammal and lizard populations are also seriously impacted by this.  The high densities of breeding curlew do not arise from burning but rather because of predator control and an abundance of habitat.  Nonetheless, it shows that if managed properly, with due regard for timing and location, burning need not impact breeding curlew territories.  The task force stakeholders in this area include the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, BirdWatch Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na, farmers and individual experts.

Last year or the year before there was only one application for a licence for controlled burning in the State but there were 70 cases of burning outside of that.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with the top of the iceberg to a certain extent and we must deal with the rest as well.  There is no doubt there are major concerns about the management of landscapes and ecosystems.  There has been a radical deterioration in the health of particular species.

According to recent Central Statistics Office data, environmental protection annual spending was approximately &euro;600 million per year before our time in government, and during our time in government it averaged over &euro;1.1 billion.  Since Fine Gael has taken power, it has dropped to an average of approximately &euro;400 million, or a third of what it was in our time.  I am proud of that record as we have paid serious attention to the need for environmental protection.<\/p><p>I agree with those who said earlier that the real problem is uncontrolled burning but in this legislation we are throwing matches around the country up to March.  How will one tell when there is smoke on the mountain if it is a legal fire or uncontrolled?  Currently, we can tell that any fire at that time would not be appropriate.  We are giving an effective <i>carte blanche<\/i>for uncontrolled burning to take off earlier.  In a world of climate change, there may be circumstances not seen this year where there could be a very dry early spring and uncontrolled fires could take off.  We are throwing petrol on the flames because we do not have a National Parks and Wildlife Service that is fit for purpose.  In resourcing enforcement, we must address that service.  We are not only throwing matches around but we are doing it without having any real fire protection procedures or resources.  For all those reasons it would be far better to do the research.<\/p><p>It is true that the loss of the curlew is complex.  I argue much of it is due to habitat loss, particularly from peat extraction in what were traditional wet and marshy upland areas best suited to the curlew.  From an ecological perspective we consider the entire system and we should examine uplands in an holistic fashion as a connected system.  We should design them for maximum biological protection.  An extension of the burning season does not in any way support that.  The Minister has slightly changed her comments.  She started by saying this would be good for the curlew but it is not.  The loss of the curlew may not just be due to upland burnings but it certainly will not help.  The continuation of the current practices and system leaves a lack of attention to the fact that our uplands environments are seriously degraded and not meeting ecological imperatives.  We should be doing this in a much broader and more holistic way rather than just extending the burning season, which does nothing but bad things in my mind.<\/p><p>Does the Minister refute the findings of the report from the UK presented by the Irish Wildlife Trust?  The main reason she set out for the burning practice is to allow for grouse or other bird management by cutting back heather.  It would seem there is a significant UK study indicating that is a false scientific argument and we should change our policy on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#P00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I have never heard of a controlled burning getting out of control.  Normally the rules are so stringent that cannot happen.  We need to get to the nub of this and we have a problem with overgrowth on the hills.  Some of that is due to overly prescriptive destocking.  The question is how to control this vegetation that is highly lethal in very dry months.  Is it better to have a controlled system of \"a stitch in time\"?  We know controlled burning does not get out of control but uncontrolled burning does all the time.<\/p> <p>  We inherited from previous generations a fantastic ecology in the hills.  European grants initially upset that because of overstocking and we tried to rectify that but it was like a rocking boat and it fell the other way in certain cases.<\/p><p>All sorts of things were changed and many of them by outside forces.  I have spent a long time working with farmers.  Rather than bringing a very narrow science, for generations they developed a management system that balanced everything, including wildlife, ecology and the birds that we all value.  I often think that if we involved farmers more, and took more of the old advice that gave us the ecology we have then we would have a better set up.  Instead, we lurch all over the place bringing in laws without consulting the one group of people who really understand the interlacing of everything in their areas and we often, in my view, do more harm than good.   <\/p><p> I live in the hills of Connemara.  I do not own land myself and it is a long time since I had responsibility for farming in the west of Ireland.  Living in Connemara and working with farmers every week and every day I know there are virtually no farmers who want to destroy the ecology of their hills because they live off it, want a mixed ecology and want to protect wildlife.  They will recognise controlled burning taking place now and again as being preferable to the alternative that they will get, partly through nature and maybe through other people lighting fires on their land or neighbouring land, which is uncontrolled burning.

The way the system has been set up for the past number of years has meant that they could not burn in March.  However, they could not burn during February because the areas were drowned in water.  There has been a lot of rain this year but we hope the weather will improve next year.<\/p> <p>  In terms of uncontrolled burning, it was not all done by the farmers who owned the land.  It came from outside and for different reasons.  Uncontrolled burning took place in March because it was illegal to burn after the month of February.  When places are overgrown they become useless.  In addition, one cannot burn anything in May and June so one must wait another year.  That is what has happened for the past eight to ten years.  When such places grow out of control then fires happen, which are uncontrolled.  We want a control system where farmers can burn in March.  Please give them the extra time.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan has made a great case for a soft border in the D&aacute;il but at the same time he wants us to be different in the South.  Farmers can burn above the ditch in the North of Ireland until 31 March and, in some hilly areas, as late as 15 April.  Why make a different case for farmers in the South?  I am a farmer and so are the men seated in the Visitors Gallery.  Many people are watching what we are doing here today at this meeting.
