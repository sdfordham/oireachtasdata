Over a month ago the European Commission published a draft strategy document outlining a possible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans.  The committee looked at the strategy and the various documents published at the time and agreed that these were really important issues that we wanted to consider in more depth.  As a small member state which has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union, we have often been interested in supporting other countries which would like to make the same journey we made many years ago.  We are delighted that Mr. Maciej Popowski, deputy director of DG NEAR, joins us.

I will start with an apology for my complicated Polish names but I think by now you must be used to that in this country.  I am very happy to have this opportunity to talk to the committee about the future enlargement of the European Union.  As Members of Parliament, the committee members play a key role in any discussion on European issues and this is a key European issue, indeed, and also one that matters to our citizens.<\/p> <p>  I would like to start with the bigger picture and put the enlargement process in the context of the ongoing debate on the future of Europe and then I will say a few words on the strategy for the western Balkans and the recent package of reports on all the candidate countries that were adopted last week.<\/p> <p>  It was just over a year ago that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, presented a so-called White Paper on the future of Europe.  This was intended as a forward-looking blueprint on how Europe will change in the next ten years or so, from the impact of new technologies on society and jobs, to doubts about globalisation, security concerns and the rise of populism.  It sets out five different scenarios which I will recall for the sake of completeness: scenario 1, carrying on the EU focus on delivering its positive reform agenda as per all agreements to date; scenario 2, nothing but the Single Market, where the EU gradually shifts its focus back to the Single Market, as the 27 member states are not able to find common ground for an increased number of policy areas; scenario 3, those who want more do more, where the EU proceeds as today but allows willing member states to do more together, which essentially amounts to a multi-speed Europe; scenario 4, doing less more efficiently, where the EU focuses on delivering more and faster in selected policy areas, and attention and limited resources are focused on them; and scenario 5, doing much more together, where member states decide to share more power, resources and decision-making across the board, which is the more Europe option.<\/p> <p>  The intention and objective of the White Paper was to stimulate debate among citizens, given that we are preparing for the elections to the European Parliament in May 2019.  Also, when one looks at those different scenarios, they form an important background to all the ongoing big debates which the committee is no doubt following in this House, whether it is the governance of the eurozone, privacy laws or European defence.  This debate on the future has picked up in all corners of Europe, citizens' dialogues are taking place regularly, including here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Last January, the Taoiseach was the first EU leader to reflect on the future of Europe with Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  In his speech he spoke of his vision for a European Union with more member states, a larger budget, and harmonisation in policy areas that have a proven European value.<\/p> <p>  Later on, in September 2017, President Juncker presented his state of the Union address to the Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and asked for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union, where solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand in all policy areas, from migration to the banking and monetary union, from energy to our common budget, a Union where the rule of law is not optional but the very basis of everything we do.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to the subject of the western Balkans, because in the same speech, President Juncker stated very clearly that if we want more stability in our neighbourhood, then we must maintain a credible enlargement perspective for the western Balkans and in the future the EU will be more than 27.  That was a sea change because the countries in the western Balkan region were looking forward to, so this European perspective, a clear European perspective, I must say, was confirmed.  Since then, we have put words into action and stepped up our support to our partners in the western Balkans.  This has included the adoption of the strategy for western Balkans in February of this year.  The strategy confirms that the door of the Union remains in principle open, beyond any doubt for the western Balkan countries.  It is an important signal of encouragement to them.  Now it is up to the countries concerned to build on that momentum. It is a fantastic opportunity, but there is still a lot of work ahead and there is no time to waste.<\/p> <p>  The western Balkans strategy is not a blank cheque.  It is the beginning of a process in which established conditions have to be met.  This will require an acceleration of reforms.  The leaders of the region need to make a political and societal choice to embrace EU values, not only on paper, but in reality. <\/p> <p>  There is a target date in this strategy that has raised expectations and has led to many debates both within the European Union and the region, but a 2025 target date has to be read as a sign of encouragement in a best-case scenario but not as a given.  It is not a guarantee, nor is it set in stone.  It is an incentive.  It is ambitious but doable for those most advanced.<\/p> <p>  There are no shortcuts or free passes on the way to the European Union, and the enlargement methodology, as established some time ago, will continue to apply.  We call it the fundamentals first approach, which stands on the basis that any future accession will be purely merit-based, depending on the progress each country makes.  The criteria are clear.  The ball is very much in the countries' court.  For the time being Montenegro and Serbia are front runners.  They started accession talks and are ahead of others but front runners can fall behind if they do not deliver, while others can catch up.<\/p> <p>  To help the countries address these challenges, the Commission put forward the so-called six flagship initiatives on the rule of law, security and migration, socio-economic development, increasing connectivity, a digital agenda for the Balkans, and pushing harder for good neighbourly relations and reconciliation.  Under these initiatives the EU announced its intention to support real progress, reform and change in the region.  We are also going to offer additional financial support to those countries for all of those necessary reforms that need to be undertaken.  As announced by my Commissioner, Johannes Hahn, the Commission intends to put on the table an additional &euro;500 million until 2020 through redeployment of pre-accession funding.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, this new strategic opening will not replace the current process, policies and programmes but will enrich them.  Enlargement policy, as such, remains unchanged which was confirmed again last week by the Commission when it adopted the so-called enlargement package.  This is a set of six country reports from all of those countries in the region, and Turkey, and a general communication recalling the principles of enlargement policy.  It takes stock of the state of play in the countries and draws conclusions on the implementation of the enlargement policy up to the end of January 2018, particularly as regards reforms in fundamental areas, including the rule of law, fundamental rights, governance, economic development and competitiveness.  It simply reinforces the message of own merit as a key principle of enlargement policy and it shows, yet again, that this policy is not an end in itself but is a strategy of exporting stability to our immediate front yard.  This underlines the importance of building broad public acceptance for enlargement policy in member states.<\/p> <p>  I will mention a few highlights of the of the package, namely, the Commission's recommendations to open accession negotiations with Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  This was something new, and is based on the good progress made and the Commission's assessment that the necessary conditions set in 2016 have been met in both countries.  It is an important step forward and underlines the importance of the EU response when countries deliver.  This is what makes enlargement policy credible and incentivises countries to engage in far-reaching reforms.<\/p> <p>  However, and this applies to all the countries in the region, a lot remains to be done.  All countries must now urgently tackle the key areas, including the rule of law, fundamental rights, the fight against corruption and state capture, and organised crime.  Countries must also significantly up their game on economic reforms and tackling high unemployment.  We also put a strong emphasis on reconciliation and ensuring good neighbourly relations.  All pending bilateral issues must be settled ahead of accession, starting with a legally binding comprehensive normalisation agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.<\/p><p> If the committee allows me a side remark here, I would say that we want to help in this process of reconciliation between different communities in the Balkans.  Ireland's unique experience of building and sustaining peace and promoting reconciliation on the island continues to be of great benefit to peace builders elsewhere, including in the Balkans.  We want to build on certain practices within the European Union.<\/p><p> I will now say a few words on Turkey because Turkey is a candidate country too, although I know it is not a focus in the debate, but I will speak briefly on this.  Our analysis shows that the country continues to move away significantly from the European Union, in particular in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights.  We have repeatedly called on Turkey to reverse this negative trend as a matter of priority, and we make very clear recommendations to this end in the report.  At the same time, Turkey is and will remain a key strategic neighbour.  In this context, I commend Turkey's great efforts to provide shelter and support to more than 3.5 million registered Syrian refugees.  The EU remains committed to assisting Turkey in addressing this challenge.<\/p><p> On my final point, which is the next steps to be taken, on 17 May, our leaders meet their counterparts from the western Balkans in Sofia.  It is the first such summit since Thessaloniki Summit 15 years ago.  This will not only be an opportunity to reaffirm the region's European perspective but it should also strengthen links between the EU and the western Balkans in infrastructure and digital and human connectivity, and bring us closer together to tackle common challenges.  It will be a great opportunity for the western Balkans to confirm an unequivocal commitment to reform and good neighbourly relations.<\/p><p> There is this western Balkan momentum now that we will have to maintain, because we want to bring this project to a successful end.  Enlargement is a priority policy of the European Commission, and in a way it is also a logical continuation of the notion of European integration as a peace project.  That is where it all comes from.  It is very important, and this would also be my message to the committee, to conduct a wide debate on the subject in all member states, because we need to raise awareness of the enlargement process but also build acceptance of the outcome of the negotiations in the future, and that is where national parliaments will play a key role.  I am looking forward to an exchange of views with committee members and I thank them for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maciej Popowski","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

I have always had some concern about expansion of the European project.  One is acutely aware of the old economic diminishing marginal returns to expansion, and the larger we get, the more precarious things become.  Clearly, there is great benefit in expanding the project and taking in other countries.  When we look at the western Balkans, however, we are looking at countries that are still in a state of development and of learning mutual respect for one another in some particular parts of the former Yugoslavia.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, if we set down the rules and they meet the rules, that is one part of the equation.  The other part of the equation is the peace and reconciliation that is required right across that particular geographic area.  There are still open wounds, and we know in this country what open wounds are like, how long they take to repair, and how long it takes people to build an understanding and a trust with one another.  It is not just economics that will be important.  It is not just security on a country-by-country basis.  It is not just an understanding of migration.  It is an understanding of neighbours, what is required to be a good neighbour, and what is required for reconciliation.<\/p> <p>  As we move into the Balkans, in particular, there is probably a need for some sort of reconciliation process to be underpinned and overseen by the European Union before we consider a rush forward.  I sometimes worry, because of the loss of the UK under Brexit, that we might be inclined to rush forward and replace the UK.  It is great what the witness has told us here today.  It gives me some reassurance that that is not happening, but I would like to see more overt reconciliation.  I would like to see, perhaps, a conference in the Balkans across all of the different actors or groups and to hear, under almost a Chatham House Rules scenario, some of the open wounds being explored and purged, for want of a better word, before we start hoping to move together.<\/p> <p>  The Turkish issue bothers me.  I agree with the assessment of the witness that Turkey seems to be moving further away rather than closer, and that is a matter of great concern, especially as one gets closer to the Middle East and all of the instability in that region right now.<\/p> <p>  I commend the witness on the work he is doing.  Those are the concerns that I have, and I would be interested in the views of the witness on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#C00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

It is timely to look at the enlargement process and to examine its merits.  I do not agree with the general thrust that we should stay well away from enlargement at this stage.  Many people have said in recent years that we enlarged too quickly.  I do not agree.  There were very few options at the time.  Enlargement was the better option to bring those countries that were on the periphery of the European Union into the Union, apply the<i>acquis communautaire<\/i>and try to bring them together as a family.  It is time we Europeans viewed each other more as neighbours, friends and fellow Europeans rather than as foreigners.  That that is the lesson to be learned from the modern era, from the whole situation of refugees traipsing across Europe.  It is no harm to acknowledge again the Turkish contribution in relation to Syrian refugees.  Where else would they be if they had not been accommodated in some of the neighbouring countries?  I recognise the difficulty with the immediate neighbours on the eastern borders of the modern European Union.<\/p><p>The question of extra membership is no harm at all.  It is important, however, to ensure that the <i>acquis<\/i>is observed by all incoming countries and by existing countries.  There is a tendency occasionally for existing countries to forget what we are about.  It is no harm at this stage to mention that and to look at those countries.  I tabled a parliamentary question about this recently, looking at the degree to which some existing and established countries are happy, or if the rest of Europe is happy, with their adherence to the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons we need to accommodate, encourage and bring on board countries such as those in the western Balkans.  Extra membership of the European Union is one, which would be of benefit to small countries and other countries that are small in terms of stature but not always small in terms of political influence.  It is also important to try to ensure that we do not create a them and us situation whereby we treat the incoming or potentially incoming countries with suspicion.  It is a dangerous thing to do.  It creates enmity, bitterness and the kinds of things that happened, for instance, when Britain first attempted to join what was then the EEC and there was strong  opposition from some existing European countries.  I am not going to go into the details of that now but I can remember it quite well.<\/p><p>We need to be very careful not to allow that to happen, not to create bitterness in incoming countries before they arrive at all.  From a security point of view, it is equally essential that the western Balkans is treated as a special entity.  The history of Europe should be enough to tell us all the things that have happened and that tend to happen in that particular area.  We must try to ensure that we create the political and economic environment to prevent similar events happening in the future.<\/p><p> We must also consider the fact that major catastrophes have arisen from small beginnings, and that is the issue on which we need to concentrate.  Like everybody else, I have travelled in that area both on holidays and officially.  I laud the work that has already been done to include the western Balkans and bring them into the loop, as it were.  I hope that will continue.  I also hope that no situation arises whereby there is a diminution in what is required to accommodate anybody.  We are either all in the one school or we are not in the one school.  We all contribute and aspire to the same objectives or we do not.  It is hugely important to set down these markers in the beginning rather than at a later stage.<\/p><p> The Single Market is there for everyone, including new members when they come on board.  That means the full benefits and positive elements of the Single Market remain available and continue to be available throughout the European Union.  There is a tendency in other discussions nowadays to raise having different stages of European integration and Europeanism and that perhaps we should go in different directions.  I am not an advocate of that school of thought.  We need to keep Europe together.  It would be a very dangerous thing to create any new power blocs within Europe which might tend to go in diverse directions.  It would be negative from the perspective of Europe, both in its existing and future form, and would not be good for either peace, stability or economic viability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#C00500","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.

I am a strong believer in a deepening and widening of the European project.  Ultimately, this is the greatest peace project in the history of mankind and the further we widen it into former conflict zones, the better for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the accession process, however, a concern I have which I raised with Mr. Kiely when he was here to talk about the future of Europe is the return for the accession process.  If the ultimate aim is European membership and acceding to the European Union, that is great, but what happens in the meantime?  What are the tangible rewards for coming to terms with the Copenhagen criteria?  I think specifically of the case of Turkey, which Senator Craughwell mentioned.  How long has Turkey been waiting?  One could argue that it has been waiting since the 1960s, when Ireland, the UK, Denmark, and Norway first considered joining, yet nothing has moved.  Has that changed the political impression in Turkey in recent years?  Perhaps there is an element of frustration.  Erdoan and his new brand of Islamic nationalism has forced them to look away from the European dream and to say perhaps the EU will never let them in and what is the point in bothering if the EU is just going to keep Turkey at arm's length.  What can we do to show that there is not just an accession process but a step 1, step 2, step 3 and they come with certain rewards and goals as well as ultimate accession?  We cannot just say the door is open.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the timeline for the expansion of the EEC, as it was, starting with our own accession in 1973, the longest we have ever gone without a new member state joining is nine years.  It is five years since the Croats joined.  I do not know if one of the applicant countries from the western Balkans will make it into the European Union in the next four years.  How long will it be until we do extend the club, as such?  We know it is going to shrink in about a year's time, whether we like it or not, but we do have to be prepared to broaden out and make sure that we are equipped, because many would argue that in 2007 we were too quick to let Bulgaria and Romania in, and perhaps they were not ready at that stage and, indeed, their economies suffered.  Significant issues still remain in Romania, in particular with corruption.  We heard that mentioned in the remarks of the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak to one country specifically, namely, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  It ties in with what I have said.  When I was on the European Committee of the Regions I was on the joint consultative committee, JCC, for that country and I travelled there a number of times and hosted delegations of local authority members from that region in Brussels.  I did not quite manage to get them to Dublin but my former colleague, Hughie McGrath, did bring a group to Nenagh to show them the sights and sounds of that part of Ireland.  When I was there it was at the height of the refugee migration crisis, which we are still experiencing, and there were mayors and local authority figures from a relatively poor country dealing with an avalanche of people trying to go through their country to get to the European Union.  They were only passing through.  They were not staying but the supports they were receiving from the European Union were small and did not meet their needs.  They felt they were being used to an extent and, ultimately, they were told that it was all part of the process and one day they would be part of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  We can only treat countries in the region like that for so long, because the conflict in Syria is not ending, the refugee crisis is ongoing, and the civil war has been going on for seven years.  If we are expecting accession countries to filter migration into the European Union and telling them that one day they will get a chance to join the great Union, after a while they will get pretty sick of just kind words on future accession.  There have to be tangible rewards that can work both ways, that can be of benefit to the European Union as well as the accession countries.  The challenge for the future of Europe debate is to formalise that relationship and put it down so it is quite obvious and clear to the layman in the accession countries or the remaining 27 member states what the accession process requires.  We know that through the Copenhagen criteria, but what do countries get in return through the total process and not just the end result?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#D00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Richmond.

We very much welcome the participation of the ambassadors who are representative of the various embassies at our meetings.  The debate is very interesting.  I am very much in favour of the enlargement of the European Union, in particular the accession of countries from the western Balkans.<\/p> <p>  I wish to concentrate specifically on Montenegro.  I would like Mr. Popowski to read a report with which I was involved from 31 January 2015 called the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee).  It relates to Resolution No. 1115 (1997).  The summary of the situation is that I was monitoring Montenegro with Mr. Sasi from Finland and we carried out extensive meetings in Montenegro with the President, the Prime Minister and all Government Ministers.  We prepared a report and now Montenegro is in a post-monitoring situation.  We toured all of Montenegro.  We went to the Roma camps, which were looking after people from the Roma community.  They were doing their best in that regard.  We identified the key issues in relation to the judiciary, the situation with the media, which is very important, the fight against corruption and organised crime, the right of minorities, the fight against discrimination, and the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons.  We had open access to the entire Government in Montenegro, which was very important.<\/p> <p>  I wish to emphasise Montenegro but I am also in favour of all the accession candidates from the region.  It is vital that we extend the European Union to promote continuing stability in the region and that we are not held back by the Brexit situation.  Let us leave Brexit aside.  That is being negotiated at the moment.  We should not let the Government of the United Kingdom put a stop to the growth of the European Union.  The European Union is bigger than any one country.  We should not be delayed or delay any of those countries who are now looking forward to accession.  Montenegro applied to join the EU in June 2012 and it has closed chapters 25 and 26.  We carried out the report to which I referred and which was adopted unanimously by the Council of Europe on 31 January.  Montenegro uses the euro although it is not in the eurozone.  The euro is the main currency in Montenegro.<\/p><p>I found it a very peaceful region and we want to maintain that peace.  There is also the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It is very important that Bosnia and Herzegovina is embraced by the European Union at an early stage.  I am not particularly promoting it as much as I would Montenegro and Serbia, but it will have membership in future because that is where the difficulties arose in the past.  The war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<\/p><p> It just happened that I prepared this report.  I am delighted now, as a member of the Seanad and a former member of the Council of Europe, to promote the report to Mr. Popowski.  It has given me a great opportunity.  I ask him to read the report.  It is very detailed, very fair and very honest.  If all of these Balkan states are not given encouragement, they could revert back to the same situation as we had before.  They are very hungry to join.  They promoted to me the fact they were very concerned about joining NATO.  I made the point to them that it was not necessary to join NATO to join the European Union.  We are not members of NATO and it is likely we will not be members of NATO, but there is this idea in the region.  They are worried about Russia, of course, and I accept this, and they want to maintain security.  Relationships in the region between Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo are good and we want to maintain this.<\/p><p> I am delighted to have had this opportunity as a member of the committee, which is a very important committee in this regard.  At some stage I would like to meet a delegation from Montenegro, or any other applicant state, at one of our future meetings to discuss its application to the European Union.  I support fully Montenegro and I ask Mr. Popowski to push it.  By the way, many of Mr. Popowski's neighbours from Poland are in Ireland and are working very well.  Ireland also has an awfully big investment in Poland.  It works both ways.  Many Irish people work in Poland.  The Polish people here are more than welcome and they play a very important role.  Only for them we would not have as many clergymen here as we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#D00500","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time so I will confine myself to a few remarks.  I thank Mr. Popowski for his briefing on the enlargement situation with particular reference to the western Balkans.  In his contribution he spoke about the future of Europe, which is the background of all of our discussions. Brexit was a big shock to us all.  It was a big shock to us in Ireland, but also a shock to the European Union as a whole.  Various people have outlined their vision for Europe, including Jean-Claude Juncker as Mr. Popowski mentioned, and President Macron made a very important address to the European Parliament recently.  We in Ireland agree with some of what he said and perhaps not more.  We have concerns about his proposals for the reform of the eurozone.<\/p> <p>  President Macron struck a chord on the vision for Europe, the need to promote European values and to recommit to those values.  He is concerned about the rise of illiberal tendencies throughout the European Union, especially in some of the member states.  Turkey is a case in point although it is not in the European Union, as is Poland.  Concerns have been expressed about Poland but more particularly about Hungary.  Is the European Commission concerned about this?  I know some of the clauses of the treaty have been invoked to deal with this situation with regard to some of the member states.  It is a concern in any discussion on the future of the European Union and a vision for the European Union to see these illiberal tendencies breaking out in various member states.  It is something of which we and the Commission always have to be conscious of.  It is something we have to deal with.  What is the Commission's view of this threat to the future of the European Union?<\/p> <p>  Like other speakers I fully support the enlargement of the European Union and this has always been the Irish position.  The last great enlargement took place during our Presidency when many central and eastern European states joined the European Union and it was a great cause for celebration.  We cannot be seen to be pulling up the ladder.  We have done well out of the European Union and we need to extend the benefits of the European Union to other applicant countries in the interests of peace, prosperity and progress, especially in the Balkan region, which has been a source of instability throughout modern history.  If reforms are encouraged and supported, we as member states of the European Union should be fully supportive of their applications.<\/p> <p>  I note the deteriorating situation in Turkey, having regard to what I have just outlined, and the early general election on 24 June.  It does not bode well for Turkey getting into the European Union.  While it would be of great benefit to Europe to have Turkey in the European Union, that day is getting pushed back more and more and this is regrettable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#E00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524661200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for their comments.  I agree with them and I am very encouraged by their positive attitude to enlargement.  It makes my job and the job of the team so much easier.  Specifically on the points that have been raised, I will start with Senator Craughwell's comments on reconciliation.  I could not agree more.  This is a key.  We cannot just go on ignoring the past because the past will haunt us.  I picked up his idea of a conference and it is something I will be happy to discuss with my team because, as I said in my introduction, we would like to draw on the experience of member states.  He mentioned the Northern Ireland peace process.  The Good Friday Agreement was concluded only 20 years ago, so the people who made it happen are still around and active participants in public life.  We should reach out to them and see how they can inspire people in Kosovo or other places.  It is not only about Serbia and Kosovo.  It goes deeper than this.  We certainly need to bear this in mind.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan recalled the historical context and I very much agree.  This was very clearly spelled out in the strategy.  There is momentum, but we also have to look at the map first.  We are talking about European countries.  There is also the background of atrocities, starting in Sarajevo in 1914.  I have just been there and I crossed over the bridge where Franz Ferdinand was assassinated.  We must not forget this.  There is still potential for conflict and we want to eliminate this.  The whole process of enlargement is an effective measure of prevention.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan that European law has to be applied by everyone, existing member states and new member states.  This is why the Commission adopted the policy of fundamentals first.  We will be very firm on this.  It also ties in with the point made by Deputy Haughey on values and illiberal tendencies.  I will not comment on this in detail because it goes well beyond my remit, but we think if a country wants to become a member of the European Union it has to play by the rules, and the rules are the same for everyone.  We take them very seriously and this will not change.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point raised by Senator Richmond on incentives, the benefits do not only come at the end as the countries also change.  They do not change because of Brussels and because we tell them to change.  They change because it is good for the people.  In a way, we are accompanying them on this road.  We also provide a lot of assistance.  We want to top up significantly the pre-accession funding available for countries in the western Balkans so we can invest in roads, energy, infrastructure and the education of young people.<\/p><p> One of the European Union's successes is the Erasmus programme, the student exchange scheme.  We intend to double the budget available for the western Balkans so that we can raise a new generation of Europeans.  That is part of our package.  <\/p><p> Turkey is a different case.  It is not that Europe is moving away from Turkey, it is Turkey moving away from Europe.  It is still a candidate country and we expect it to fulfil the obligations of a candidate country, to stick to certain conditions and to accept the fundamental values.  We will continue our co-operation with Turkey, as difficult as it is at times.  We will also focus on areas where we can support Turkish civil society, research communities, students and the younger generation, and continue our quite successful co-operation on migration management.  I must give credit where it is due.  The Turkish Government and the Turkish people have done a great job in accommodating those 3.5 million Syrians.  They live in difficult conditions, but they are dignified conditions, and they are much better off in Turkey than they would be at home or many other transit countries, in which they sometimes find themselves. <\/p><p> On the timelines of the process, the target date is 2025.  For clarity, this is indicative.  It may happen, but it is an incentive not a guarantee.  If there is a delay, there is a delay.  We want to do it properly.  Both the countries concerned and ourselves need to be ready for enlargement.  <\/p><p> I thank Senator Leyden for his comments on Montenegro.  I will be happy to read his recommendations.  We are working very closely with the Council of Europe.  It is the depository of basic conventions, for instance, and it also helps us enormously in our work on the rule of law and judicial reform.  The Venice Commission also plays an important role.  It was very prominent in Albania when it embarked on major judicial reform last year.  When we were drafting the country reports to which I referred, we drew heavily on the expertise of the Council of Europe.  Montenegro is a front-runner country which is doing well.  Its progress has been clearly recognised.  I am sure that it will stay on its European track and make even quicker progress. <\/p><p> I also thank the Senator for his kind words about the Polish constituency in Ireland.  <\/p><p> Deputy Haughey referred to values.  I commented on values but I am not well-placed to comment on the internal discussions with member states, that it the role of our political masters, particularly Vice President, Frans Timmermans, who is in charge.  I agree that we must be very consistent when we talk about values and fundamental principles.  That is what makes us Europeans, we want to keep it that way and despite the various tendencies, I am sure that we will.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for this debate.

We feel it is an important contribution and is of particular assistance to our dream of joining the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Twenty eight years ago, when they changed the regime, the citizens of Albania had one dream, which was to make Albania like the rest of Europe.  Now, after 28 years, we are on the eve of realising this, thanks to the assistance and continued support of European Union countries.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the Irish Parliament, the President and all parties for the continual and unconditional support which they gave to all of the western Balkan countries in their path towards integration into the European Union.<\/p><p>I refer again to the unconditional support that Ireland has given to my country for integration.  We have prepared a paper regarding the development.  I will not enter into the details of what we have written.  I will just express our view of how important integration into the European Union is for the western Balkans.  I give the concrete example of the integration of Albania.  Twenty years ago, we had the terrible experience of the collapse of pyramid schemes and the terrible effect of civil war.  <\/p><p> However, Albania as a NATO member, an important regional player and the specific role my country is playing in the region shows that the integration of the countries of the region into the EU and into NATO is the best solution for our future.  In the last five years at least, this dream of the magnetic force - that we can join the EU one day - has made our leaders more reasonable and more pragmatic to work together.  I will give an example.  Until five years ago, there were no exchanges of visits between the Presidents or Prime Ministers of Albania and Serbia.  The President of Serbia and the Prime Minister of Albania have met each other ten times in the past year.  <\/p><p> This is a concrete example of how the atmosphere has changed in the western Balkans.  We are working together, our politicians are working together and our peoples are working together.  This magnetic positive force called the EU has changed everything.  We have some data regarding support for the EU in my country.  It is 80% to 90%.  However, I honestly do not know about this 10% of people who do not support membership in the EU.  Anyway, Albania is a NATO member and is playing its role in the region.  We have strongly supported the membership of Montenegro in NATO.  We also strongly support the Macedonian membership of NATO because we think that only a region integrated into NATO and the European Union will be a region of peace and stability.  We know the bad legacy of the past is there.  It is in the past for the moment.  Only by working together to build our future and build our institutions will the reality be different for this region.  <\/p><p> Albania is doing its own work as a candidate member.  Last week, we received a very positive and encouraging message from the Commission.  It declared that it will present the decision to open accession talks with Albania to the Council.  This is a positive and encouraging message.  Last year, Albania made changes to its judiciary and its constitutional system.  In the last 25 years, the judiciary had been considered one of the most problematic and corrupt institutions.  Thanks to the assistance of the EU and the United States we have built a vetting system to check the wealth of the judges and prosecutors.  This system brought some concrete results - some 21 judges are no longer members of this system.  An investigation of their unjustified wealth will start.  The good news is that the example of Albania and the changes we made in our constitution will be used by other partners and friendly countries in the western Balkans.<\/p><p> We are trying to do our best as a member of NATO.  Our forces are in Bosnia and Kosovo.  They are also in Afghanistan and Mali and our naval vessels are making a modest contribution to the control of the influx of illegal immigration in the Aegean Sea.  We strongly support the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia because we think the only solution for both countries is through negotiations and trying to find a common and acceptable solution for both parts.  We appreciate the role of President Aleksandar Vui of Serbia and President Hashim Tha&ccedil;i of Kosovo in this process.  We are encouraging this negotiation.  It is the only way to resolve this problem.  Kosovo is a reality.  More than 120 countries have already recognised it and it is on a path towards EU and Euro-Atlantic integration.  I end with these words and hopefully I will be ready and able to answer some questions.  Ireland is an inspiring model for a country like us.  The chance that Ireland had 25 years ago, we have to have in the near future.  We know we have a lot of work to do.  However, we know where we would like to arrive.

Unfortunately, the ambassador, due to previous commitments, could not be here today, but I am endowed to present assurances of his highest consideration.<\/p> <p>  I am grateful for this opportunity to speak today in the admired Houses of the Oireachtas on topics related to the European Union, in this, on various aspects, highly dynamic and important moment of its existence.  The focus of the discussion will be on the process of European enlargement, accession or unification - the terminology shifts, depending on which side of the continent the narrator stands.<\/p> <p>  The documents disseminated with the kind assistance of the committee secretariat contain more detailed information on the current status of the European integration process of Montenegro and highlight the main recent achievements of the economic policy in my country.  Before I inform the committee of the main activities, plans and expectations related to the integration process in Podgorica, allow me to bring the attention of the committee to the latest official standpoints of Brussels.  On 6 February this year, the European Commission adopted the strategy for a credible enlargement perspective for, and enhanced EU engagement with, the western Balkans.  Luckily, the main message of this document is much simpler than its title &ndash; the European perspective of the western Balkan countries is clear and undoubted.  <\/p> <p>  EU enlargement remains one of the crucial pillars of the broader strategy for strengthening the Union until 2025.  What is also important for us in Montenegro, as the leader of European integration process in the Balkans, is reiterated confirmation that enlargement is and will remain a process based on individual merits of the candidates, and based solely on the objective progress made &ndash; the so called \"regatta principle\".  On the other hand, the EU strategy states that the countries in the region must undertake profound and deep reforms in key areas: the rule of law, governance and the economy, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption and organised crime.<\/p><p>The 2018 European Commission report on Montenegro of 17 April this year mirrors, in more detail, the principal recommendations in the mentioned EU strategy for the western Balkans.  According to Brussels, there is a need to strengthen transparency, stakeholders' participation and capacity to implement reforms.  Coherence of the policy-making system should be ensured through co-ordinated policy development.  Among the positive remarks on the achievements in the country mentioned in the document, but also repeated by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, last week in Podgorica, is that Montenegro fully complies, without exception, with the positions, declarations and statements of the European Union when it comes to joint foreign and security policy issues.  The continued efforts of Montenegro in the promotion of regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations towards the creation of a stable and secure region have been perpetually recognised.  We cherish and continuously promote the standpoint that open issues and disputes among the countries in the Balkans should be resolved within the region, in a democratic and transparent manner, in close co-operation with our EU partners and in accordance with established European standards and procedures.<\/p><p>Since 2010, when Montenegro gained official candidate status for membership of the EU, and more decisively from June 2012, when we started our membership negotiations with the Union, the state institutions have been permanently working on the accomplishment of planned, needed reforms, in order to bring the negotiation process to an end and become the next member of the EU.  Montenegro has opened 30 negotiating chapters, temporarily closing three.  During the ongoing Bulgarian European Council Presidency, we expect to open the remaining chapters, and enter the new, continued phase of closing the chapters with accomplished, agreed benchmarks.  Welcoming the remarks and suggestions of partner EU institutions, the Government of Montenegro has set up clear economic development plans, relying on a set of measures to strengthen the macroeconomic fiscal and financial stability of the country, and to finalise the restructuring of the country's economy, thus raising competitiveness and increasing potential for economic growth.  GDP increase in 2017 has been over 4%.  Forecasted growth for the period of 2018 to 2020 is approximately 2.8%.  The unemployment rate in the last quarter of 2017 was 17%.  Our aim is to bring the public debt under 60% of GDP by 2020.  GDP per capita, the highest in the region, is estimated at a level of around 45% of the EU average.<\/p><p> It is of particular importance that stable economic growth is followed by firm respect of the rule of law.  The reforms in fighting corruption and organised crime are giving increasing results.  We are in our third year of implementation of a new set of judicial laws.  A centralised commercial court was established and reform of the misdemeanour system has been implemented.  The special state prosecution department is raising the number of its indictments.  Each case of organised crime and corruption also launches a financial investigation.  Concrete figures are shown in the circulated documents.  At the same time, we are well aware that we need to further our efforts to promote a stable track record in the functioning of the respective institutions and mechanisms, with emphases on the areas of trafficking of human beings and money laundering.  The legislative and operational mechanisms in these areas are being adjusted to the actual need for more tangible results.  Particular attention is being provided to the establishment of a societal environment for full media independence, freedom and professionalism.  The Government has initiated changes of key legislation in this area, and we believe that we will, in partnership with our European partners and internal actors, create an improved environment for a stronger and proper role of media in our society, as one of the main pillars of democracy.<\/p><p> Along our road - I would avoid saying European, but our EU road - the Government of Montenegro is accentuating our focus not on dates, but on the quality of implementation of the reforms.  Numerous activities strengthening the economy and rule of law and modernising public administration aim, first of all, to raise the standards of living of our citizens.  The results of the EU accession process follow and the most important are to come.  It is crucial that the results are felt by the people in the country.  Marks by the administrators who are reading forms and making notes on the progress are welcomed.  Concluding my address, I once again stress our awareness that the rest of our EU path will not be relaxed, as our road to NATO membership was not laid back.  We are determined to finish this historic step successfully as well.  In our endeavours, we particularly appreciate and remember good intentions and useful support coming from our friends from the EU.  This support means even more when it comes from the smaller countries, which have gone through similar challenges on their way to a brighter future.  I thank the committee for its attention.  I hope we will have the opportunity during the envisaged questions-and-answers session to exchange views on the potential for bilateral co-operation between our friendly countries in particular areas, apart from the EU integration process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mladen Draga&scaron;evi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I welcome Ambassador Qirko and the counsellor from Albania, and their colleague from Montenegro.  I will not delay long because I have outlined the situation in Montenegro.  I was not quite aware that the deputy ambassador was in the audience.<\/p> <p>  The Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, said \"don't turn your back on us\" in April.  We would be very supportive, as we have said in respect of Montenegro.  It is important that the Balkans become members of the European Union.  We are agreed on that.  When one sees the geographic location, on the coast, of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, all the way in to Serbia and Kosovo, it is obvious that the region has to join.  Let us get a move on.  What is being done in Albania is happening in Montenegro.  The judiciary is being reformed.  The Venice Commission has been involved in advising on how to bring about the rule of law and democracy.  That is very worthwhile.  The witnesses' countries are coming out of a situation where they were held back since 1919.  They were not given an opportunity to develop.  The opportunities for Albania are enormous, including tourism and so on.  It is a tremendous location in respect of its climate and so on.<\/p> <p>  I note the statement and work on Kosovo.  The recognition of Kosovo is important.  That will be an important step in the right direction.  There is an open door to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  My interpretation of members' views is that we would be very much in support of the witnesses' countries membership of the European Union and we will do the utmost to push for their membership and for security in that region.  That is vital.  Unless we embrace that region, the danger is that it could lapse into more problems in future.  I thank the witnesses for coming.  It was a worthwhile contribution.  I have enjoyed listening to their views, studying their programme and studying what their Prime Minister has said.  The Albanian Government is very democratic, with a 50% male and 50% female cabinet.  It is progressive with regard to gender balance.  I see the reforms which have taken place.  They are worthwhile.  As the witnesses said, it is in the interests of the people.  What the European Union will do in the future of Albania and Montenegro is in the interests of their citizens.  That is what the witnesses' concern is.

I will deal with Albania first.  The steps taken in curbing corruption and putting judicial processes in place are to be commended.  Albania's abundance of natural resources is incredible and probably explains the unemployment rate.  There is tremendous capacity to build a very strong economy, which would be more than welcome in the European project.  The witnesses can be assured of this country's support as Albania moves forward.  I am interested to see that Albania is developing sustainable energy in the region.  While there are natural resources there that could probably meet Albania's energy needs, the fact that it is engaging in developing sustainable energy is really important.<\/p><p>My final point on Albania is that, recognising war and instability in the region in recent years, its commitment to peace and reconciliation is to be commended, admired and supported in every possible way.  As we move forward into the European Union and as Albania's negotiations become more pronounced, any help we can provide should be forthcoming.  Albania is clearly taking a leadership role.  Hopefully, it will bring other countries along with it and we will see all Balkan states within the European project.  That is very commendable.  I thank the witnesses for coming here today.<\/p><p> With respect to Montenegro, my colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, has said it all.  I appreciate greatly the witnesses coming over from the UK today to engage with us.  I am a little concerned at Montenegro's unemployment rate when I see it trying to resolve its GDP problems also.  I am concerned because I know the pain involved in redressing an economy with these problems.  We have suffered that here for the last ten years and, thankfully, are coming out the other side.  Sadly, as one tries to redress GDP issues, unemployment rates tend to grow.  As such, Montenegro is going to go through a fairly painful process in the not-too-distant future.  Having said that, the reward is mighty.  Montenegro's people can only benefit from the measures being taken now.  The European Union and its member states must support that.  It is not so long ago in this country that we had a massive unemployment rate but, today, we are almost at full employment again.  As a former trade union leader, it might stick in my craw but good economic management brought us back to the point of full employment and growth.  It takes time.  As Montenegro moves forward, the strengthening of its economy is the whole thing.  I wish the country well and am delighted to do what I can in my Independent capacity here on any support we can give.<\/p><p> It is important that we are all taking, as political representatives, about the idea of expansion.  The witnesses will have heard from the last presentation that I have concerns that as the project grows, there are diminishing marginal returns from expansion.  In economic terms, those diminishing marginal returns may make it more difficult for Montenegro and Albania to capitalise on the economic benefits of moving forward.  I have been in the region.  The Balkans are very beautiful and I wish Albania and Montenegro well and look forward to having them as European partners there in the not-too-distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#H00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I do not want to repeat what other speakers have said.  I welcome the ambassador and deputy ambassador and congratulate them on the work they have been doing and the reforms their countries have been implementing.  I wish them well in their endeavours.  It is good to hear that there is strong domestic support for EU membership in Albania and Montenegro.  In my previous contribution, I mentioned that Ireland had benefitted greatly from membership of the European Union since joining in 1973 and we do not want to be seen to be pulling up the ladder.  We have enjoyed its benefits and enlargement will enhance the Union.  It is important to note that the membership of the witnesses' countries will ensure peace and stability in the region and in Europe as a whole.  In particular, I congratulate Albania on the initiation or approval of accession talks, which represents great progress.<\/p> <p>  On a point of clarification, albeit it is not that important, Ireland has a policy of military neutrality and is not in NATO.  We avoid military alliances.  However, that has not impacted on our membership of the European Union at all.  For historic reasons, it is very important for the security and so on of the witnesses' countries but as a neutral state, we also can play a very important role in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#J00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and congratulate them on their progress so far and, in particular, on their positive attitude to the European project.  We wish them well in that area.  There were times in the not-too-distant past when we were very concerned about what was happening in the Balkans.  We were glad to see some degree of stabilisation take place initially.  Matters have moved on since then and the countries are moving on the right path.  I hope that when the witnesses were in the UK, they did not take on board the negativity they have there towards the European Union.  People will always look back.  That has been part and parcel of history.  People tend to look back after a while, in particular if they have reached the far shore and are in comparative safety.  They tend then to look back and say it was great in the old days.  In some ways, the old days were great, but a lot of things were very negative too.  A lot of things happened in the witnesses' region which were very disturbing.  We watched on television and saw speeches being made in the European Parliament.  I was present when the representatives of some Balkan countries broke down and cried in the European Parliament at the lack of action from the surrounding states.  That is why membership of NATO is very important for Albania and Montenegro.  I note that they are surrounded by the European Union as it is, with just the sea on the other side, but that is an advantage, of course.  However, having learned from the experiences of the past and recognising the need to proceed in a particular direction, there is nothing to lose and everything to gain.  That applies to both Albania and Montenegro and in fact to the whole region.  I referred earlier to the fact that it used to be regarded as the tinderbox of Europe in that things happened there which were minor in nature but which had a major negative impact not only on the immediate region but on the rest of Europe as well.<\/p> <p>  Employment and economic progress are important.  One thing that tends to create problems in a democracy is that, where the freedom exists, the tendency is to protest and to sometimes go further.  There is a danger that economic performance is not seen to be as good as it should be.  There is a huge difference between Montenegro and Albania in terms of bilateral trade, for example.  That is understandable.  A small population is one of the factors.  In terms of bilateral trade, the figures show Montenegro is vulnerable whereas Albania is a bigger country with a larger population.  Those comparisons need to be made in these countries' efforts to achieve what they aspire to, namely, membership of the European Union.  I agree with that objective and harbour no negativity towards it.  It is a natural progression of the European project in relation to the whole region, including the witnesses' countries.<\/p> <p>  At a time when one country is leaving the Union, it tends to create questions.  People ask whether they should go back to where they were.  We should not do that under any circumstance in any part of Europe.  There is nothing to be learned from the mistakes of the past except that they were mistakes.  The fact is that Albania, Montenegro and ourselves, as Europeans, must remain focused on the positive outcomes which have resulted from membership of the EU for us and, in the not-too-distant future, for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#J00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1524661200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I offer the witnesses an opportunity for a brief overview of the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#J00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524661200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I thank the distinguished members of the committee for their kind and encouraging words on the integration of our region into the European Union.  I wish to make a brief clarification as to why NATO membership is important for our region in comparison with the situation of Ireland.<\/p><p>A third party is also very interested in the region.  It is an old dream of the Tsars and the first secretaries of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to have a presence in the region.  In the 1960s, Khruschev had a plan to build a huge naval and submarine base in Vlor&euml; on the south coast of Albania.  Perhaps the only thing for which I appreciate our dictator was that, in 1961, he broke the relationship and kicked out the Russians from the submarine.<br\/><br\/>For small countries like Albania, Montenegro or Macedonia, this protection is important.  We hope that one day our neighbours, Serbia and Bosnia, will join our family because membership of NATO is important for the whole region.  The situation is different from the situation in Ireland and other countries.  We would like to join NATO as Albanians.  As a country, our values would set a good example in the European Union.  For example, Albania has not built any walls against refugees from Syria.  We only have 300 refugees but we have good experience of treating people who are in need.  After the Second World War, the number of Jewish people in Albania was ten times higher than the number before the war.  Jewish people came from Austria and Germany and found shelter in Albania, where they were protected by Muslim people.  More than 50% of Albanians are Muslim but they are liberal Muslim people.  We have a code of honour called &quot;<i>Besa<\/i>&quot; which means that people have a responsibility for everything that happens to a person in need and a duty to protect that person.  That is why nothing happened to Jewish people after the war.<br\/><br\/>In the 1990s, 700,000 people from Kosovo found shelter and protection in Albania after what Milosevic did to the population.  We now have 3,000 mujahidin from Iran, the opposition to the Government of the Ayatollah, living peacefully in Albania and we are glad about that.  We would like to join the European Union with a good model for how different religions can exist together.  Some 30% of the population of Albania is Orthodox Christian and 20% Roman Catholic but we have never had problems in our history because we feel Albanian first and then Muslim or Christian.  For us, religion is not something which divides people.  Inside every religion there are values if they are respected correctly.  Every kind of radicalism is negative and we would like to join what we see as our normal family with these values.  It is a perfect relationship between people with different ethnicity.  Some 98% of people in Albania are Albanian but we have a minority of Greeks, Macedonians and Montenegrans and we have never had trouble.  Sometimes we do not know if a person belongs to a minority because they are always well accepted.<br\/><br\/>In Albania, 100% of energy comes from water sources and the Government encourages investment in this area, which is one of our main areas of investment.  Tourism is an important part of our economy and, last year, 5% of GDP was from tourism.  In the near future we hope to increase that and, through changes in the fiscal system, the Government is encouraging the building of four-star and five-star hotels.  If someone builds one they will be free of taxes for the next ten years and there is great interest in this from different companies, including international companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018042500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

In some countries in the western Balkans we still feel that reconciliation is still necessary.  I remind people, however, that the origins of the European Union were in the wake of the biggest conflict in the history of mankind.  The idea of the European Union was born after the Second World War and the idea of enlargement and the unification of the European Union with the western Balkans will assist these countries to become better partners and friends in the near future.

I am here as chair of the foetal anti-convulsant syndrome forum, FACS and I am joined today by my colleague Ms Karen Keely, chair of the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome Ireland, OACS, and Mr. Peter Murphy, CEO of Epilepsy Ireland.  Karen and I will give the opening statement during which Karen will give some insight into the lived experience of families.  Peter and I will be available to answer questions that committee members may have.<\/p> <p>  Sodium valproate, or Epilim, is a drug licensed in Ireland for the treatment of epilepsy and bi-polar disorder.  Foetal anti-convulsant [valproate] syndrome - or FACS - describes a syndrome that affects children born to women who were prescribed Epilim during pregnancy.  Children exposed to this drug in the womb have an 11% chance of malformations at birth compared with a 2% to 3% in the general population.  Malformations include neural tube defects, malformation of limbs, digits and organs, cleft palate among many, many more physical conditions.  An additional 40% of children experience developmental delay and have a three to five times greater risk of developing autism, autistic spectrum disorder and ADHD.  We estimate that approximately 400 children may be affected by FACS in Ireland, but just 43 have a diagnosis from the genetics department in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, strengthened the warnings and restrictions on the use of valproate in women and girls.  In 2017, the agency reviewed how these recommendations were being implemented due to concerns that EU member states, including Ireland, were not implementing the recommendations properly.  In February of this year, the EMA issued additional instructions aimed at further tackling issues around reducing risk for women and girls of childbearing age.<\/p> <p>  The FACS forum asks that the Government deal with this issue on three fronts.  The first is in the context of those who are already affected.  We call on the Government to undertake a national study to identify how many children in Ireland are affected by this condition.  An independent investigation into the historical use of valproate in Ireland is needed.  A system of redress must also be established to meet the lifelong care needs of children and to address the impact of diagnosis on families.  This will go a long way towards avoiding the need for legal solutions for already stressed families, some of whom are represented in the Public Gallery today and the many more who would have liked to be here and who are watching online.<\/p> <p>  The second front is the need to put in place services for families who are currently affected.  Valproate-related disabilities are complex, wide-ranging and individual.  Obtaining a diagnosis is difficult and lengthy and treatment often involves attending many unconnected and un-co-ordinated specialist services.  Often, families have more than one child affected and full-time caring is required.  It is, therefore, critical that we develop a streamlined diagnostic pathway, develop a national register of those affected and audit their needs.  Most important, we must put in place the services and supports they so desperately need now.<\/p> <p>  The third front is the need to reduce the risk of children being born with FACS in the future.  There is an urgent need to fully implement the recent decision of the European Medicines Agency ruling and recommendations that I mentioned earlier.  We in the FACS forum have been greatly encouraged by the measures proposed, and the commitment shown by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the HSE, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland among other stakeholders.  We want to see all of this progress impact on the actual numbers of children being born with FACS.  Therefore, we need a systems-wide commitment that all new risk reduction initiatives will be fully monitored, fully implemented, independently evaluated and additional action taken if necessary.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we want a commitment from HSE that all women currently prescribed Epilim, especially those under GP-only care, be given priority referrals in 2018 to a specialist for an urgent treatment review.  This is now required by the EMA ruling and we ask that this happens with immediate effect.

My name is Joan Gilvarry and I am the director of human medicines at the HPRA and I am joined by my colleague Dr. Almath Spooner, the pharmacovigilance and risk-management lead at the HPRA.  Dr. Spooner is also the Irish delegate on the European Medicines Agency pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee, PRAC, which has been referred to already this morning.<\/p><p>The PRAC is the committee at the EMA responsible for assessing and monitoring safety issues for human medicines.  It is composed of experts such as doctors, pharmacists, scientists and patient organisation representatives from all EU member states.  We are grateful for the opportunity to talk to the committee this morning about the regulation of this medicine, which is known in Ireland under the brand name Epilim.  We will discuss the recent European reviews in which we have been actively involved and our collaboration with national colleagues, namely, the Department of Health, the HSE, the clinical leads in neurology, psychiatry and primary care, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, and patient representatives from Epilepsy Ireland and the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome, OACS.  I would particularly like to thank the patients and their representatives for their collaboration with us over the past number of years.<br\/><br\/>Valproate-containing medicines have been licensed across the EU and in many countries worldwide since the 1960s and in Ireland since 1975.  It is an effective treatment for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and for some patients may be the only treatment option.  When the medicine was first approved, the prescribing information included a warning about the risk of congenital abnormalities if taken during pregnancy.  These warnings were strengthened on many occasions in subsequent years as new information became available.  More recently, new studies were published internationally which showed a higher than expected risk of congenital abnormalities, together with a risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born to mothers who had taken valproate during their pregnancy.  This prompted a European-wide safety review of all the available data by the PRAC.  This review was commenced in 2013 and was finalised in 2014 concluding that children exposed <i>in utero<\/i>to valproate were at a high risk of serious developmental disorders, in up to 30% to 40% of cases, and-or congenital malformations, in approximately 10% of cases.  In the interests of patient safety, the PRAC recommended that valproate should not be prescribed to female children, female adolescents, women of childbearing potential or pregnant women unless other treatments were not effective or not tolerated.  The prescribing information and package leaflet for patients were updated with new recommendations around supervision of treatment by a specialist, the importance of using effective contraception and the need for regular treatment reviews.  In addition, warnings around use in female children, adolescents and women of childbearing potential, and the need for discussion of such issues with the patient, were highlighted.<br\/><br\/>Following that European review, the HPRA communicated extensively with neurologists, psychiatrists, paediatricians, obstetricians, GPs, specialist nurses, pharmacists and the HSE to emphasise the new warnings and recommendations.  These communications included letters from the pharmaceutical company that was mandated by us to doctors and pharmacists, following approval by the HPRA.  It appeared in several editions of our <i>Drug Safety Newsletter<\/i>, warnings in national prescribing formularies and on our website.  Additionally, materials designed to minimise the risks with the medicine, for example, a guide for patients and a patient alert card, a healthcare professional guide and a prescribing checklist were developed and distributed.  We also met with patient representatives at that time and discussed it with them.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, following concerns across Europe that the measures taken in 2014 and relayed over a number of years were not sufficiently effective in increasing awareness and reducing exposure to valproate use during pregnancy, a second European-wide safety review was initiated.  This review was again conducted by the PRAC which considered that these concerns were well founded.  During the review, the first ever public hearing was held at the European Medicines Agency where the views and experiences of patients, including our Irish colleagues who are present today, were heard and this proved to be invaluable in the development of the latest safety recommendations.  The outcome of this review has led to the introduction of new contraindications, essentially a ban on the use of valproate during pregnancy, strengthened warnings and further measures to prevent exposure during pregnancy, including a pregnancy prevention programme.  The programme will incorporate measures such as assessment of individual patients regarding their likelihood of becoming pregnant, pregnancy tests before and during treatment as needed, the need for effective contraception while on treatment, and carrying out reviews of treatment by the prescribing specialist at least once a year.  Most important is the requirement for the doctor to involve the patient in evaluating her own individual circumstances, to have a discussion with her on treatment and therapeutic options, to inform her of the risks and how to minimise the risks, and counselling around pregnancy prevention.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, the HPRA has mandated that the outer packaging of all valproate-containing medicines must include a visual symbol warning about the risks in pregnancy in addition to the boxed text that is already approved.  The blister packs inside the outer packs will also carry a visual warning symbol.  The patient reminder card will be attached to every treatment pack for pharmacists to discuss with the patient each time the medicine is dispensed.  As an interim measure, pending the production of the new cartons, stickers with the warning and pictographs are being made available to pharmacies.  Updated versions of the healthcare professional and patient guides and of the patient alert cards are being distributed to help support healthcare professionals and patients in their discussions on the minimisation of risk and to further ensure that all affected patients receive full and accurate information.  Also, based on specific feedback from patients, the pack sizes are being reduced to packs of 30.  All of these recommendations are currently being implemented in Ireland with significant progress already achieved.<br\/><br\/>Last week we published and distributed a special edition of our <i>Drug Safety Newsletter<\/i>to all registered doctors and pharmacists in the country and a letter was sent to relevant healthcare professionals by the company following approval by the HPRA.  Over the years the HPRA has worked closely with our national colleagues, including the patient groups, the HSE, the clinical leads, the PSI and the Department of Health.  Our priority at the HPRA is patient safety, and to ensure that women and girls are aware of the very real risks of taking valproate during pregnancy.  We will continue working together to facilitate timely and effective implementation of the new recommendations nationally and, crucially, to support their successful introduction into everyday clinical practice.  I thank members for their time.  Dr. Spooner and I are very happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan Gilvarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Gilvarry and call on Mr. Kilian McGrane to make his opening statement on behalf of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this morning's meeting.

The agent, available since 1967, is widely used to treat patients with epilepsy.  It is particularly useful in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, JME.  In addition to patients with epilepsy, the medication may be used in psychiatric patients with bipolar disorders.  The concerns about the use of sodium valproate in pregnancy stem from the adverse effects that it may have on the foetus.  It is accepted that this drug may cause malformations and-or neurodevelopmental delay in the unborn infant.  The risk of a congenital malformation is 10%.  The types of malformation associated with the drug are spina bifida, limb abnormalities, cleft lip or palate, unusual facial appearance with a narrow prominent forehead and receding chin.  The risk of neurodevelopmental delay is approximately 30% to 40%.<\/p><p>There may be delays in motor development, speech delay and memory problems.<\/p><p> In a paper entitled Fetal Valproate Syndrome: An Irish Experience, the department of genetics at Crumlin hospital describes 29 cases diagnosed in the period from 1995 to 2016.  This publication demonstrates the wide spectrum of abnormalities that can result from the exposure to sodium valproate during pregnancy.  Pregnant women with epilepsy are commonly encountered at antenatal clinics.  It is estimated that in Ireland approximately 400 women with epilepsy go through pregnancy each year.  In the current era, it is uncommon to find that an expectant mother is on sodium valproate medication.  Most are on alternative anti-epileptic drugs such as Kepra or Lamictal.  The default position is that sodium valproate should not be prescribed to female children, female adolescents, women of childbearing potential or pregnant women.  There may be exceptions when no other agent is able to control seizures, for example in some cases of juvenile myoclonus epilepsy.  In this scenario, the patient should be under a neurologist who can oversee, modify and monitor the treatment.  Important factors are the use of effective contraception and the need for rapid consultation if the patient becomes pregnant  All healthcare professionals need to be fully aware of the risks posed by taking sodium valproate during pregnancy.  Pharmacists should be in a position to both explain and give the patient the \"Key Facts - Valproate and Pregnancy\" card.  The information contained on this card highlights the risk to the foetus.<\/p><p> The matter of unintended consequences must also be considered.  Epilepsy is a serious disorder.  In the last tri-annual report for the UK and Ireland, there were 14 deaths from epilepsy in pregnancy, or 0.4 per 100,000.  A patient with epilepsy should not stop her medication suddenly if she becomes pregnant.  The right course of events is that she should seek urgent medical advice and be changed to an alternative medication, where possible, in a controlled manner.<\/p><p> On a more general note regarding foetal malformations, it should be noted that in the four-year period from 2009 to 2011, there were 136 cases of spina bifida, 121 cases of anencephaly and 31 cases of encephalocoele recorded in Ireland.  Thus, one per 1,000 pregnancies is affected.  Countries that have introduced folic acid fortification of food have seen a 60% reduction in the incidence of these conditions.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kilian McGrane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGrane.

I have a few questions.  Most of them are for the HSE.  There seems to be some discrepancy in the figures we are hearing.  Mr McGrane talked about 29 cases as having been diagnosed.  We also heard there were 43 diagnosed and potentially 400.  This gets to the heart of my point, which is that there really does not seem to be much by way of verifiable data.  The witnesses might explain how the numbers are collated and what they use as a measurement to decide what numbers should or should not be counted.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might also outline how Ireland compares with other European countries in dealing with this issue, for example, in terms of the services that might be available for the sufferers and those who have been diagnosed, and also in the paths to diagnosis.  There seems to be some resistance or difference there.  Are the witnesses satisfied that there are sufficient systems in place now and that women are warned?  I was contacted by someone fairly recently to say that she is of childbearing age, that she picked up her medication, which was in a see-through bag, and that there was no patient alert card with it.  How is it policed?  How does the HSE ensure that when it is issued, the alert card actually gets to the patient?  I think the witnesses will accept that it has not done so in all cases.  What penalties are there for people who do not comply with a patient alert card?  I am sure everybody wants to comply and do their best.  Is there any penalty?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the victims of this, Dr. Gilvarry mentioned the 1960s and 1970s in her statement.  She stated that new studies have been published more recently.  It strikes me that there is a fair amount of information available that would have set off alarm bells.  Dr. Gilvarry might elaborate on exactly what she meant by \"more recently\".  I am interested in when the risks were known about, how serious the level of knowledge would have been, and how it was communicated.  I think there are doctors who would have prescribed in good faith without being aware at all that there was an issue.  There may have been a time when there was some awareness among the medical community that there may have been a risk, but it might not have been widely known.  Then there is a period, which I would be interested in exploring with the witnesses, when the risks were very well known and the prescriptions continued.  Those women's children would now be in their 20s and 30s and they are dealing with a range of complex and difficult conditions.  As was outlined, the women very often have more than one child in this situation.  Perhaps the representatives from the HSE might outline for us what is in place for them.  Is there a specific package or are they simply in the mix with everybody else, trying to scrap it out for the services that are there?  Or, as was outlined by Ms Keely, do they have to go to the private sector to purchase services that should be available in the public system?  What specific packages are in place and how can they be dealt with?<\/p> <p>  I may come back with other questions at a later stage if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#F00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I convey particular thanks to the FACS Forum and to Ms Keely for giving voice to what the parents and children have been experiencing.  It has been heard.  My first question is for the forum.  There is clearly a lot of co-operation between it, those who have been affected and the relevant agencies of the State.  Do the forum members believe that the State bears any liability for what has happened?  What services are they not getting?  Do they have a sense of the kind of costs that are being incurred by families supporting children who have been affected?<\/p> <p>  For the HPRA, is it possible to establish a causal link in an individual case?  There are shocking levels of causality that can be found through clinical testing but, on the basis of an individual case, is it possible to say that a particular boy or girl has physical or neurological issues that can be causally linked to the drug?<\/p> <p>  I ask the HPRA and the HSE why there have been so few diagnoses.  If approximately one tenth of the estimated number has been diagnosed, why is that figure so low?  I ask the HSE what the response has been to the requests that have been laid before the committee this morning from the FACS Forum.  It has requested that there be a study on the number of children, an investigation into how this happened in the first place, and that the services required be provided.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the parents and children are not looking for a slice of a finite pie.  Is there a package that has been put in place?<\/p><p>Is there any estimate of the cost to the State of providing the required services or the cost per family or child?  Mr. McGrane mentioned children not reaching full potential as a result of neurological development delay.  Does that mean the child will reach his or her full intellectual capacity but take longer to do so, or that the child or adult will have a permanent intellectual issue?<\/p><p> I have a question for the representatives from either the HPRA or the HSE.  Mr. McGrane stated that it is now uncommon for the drug to be prescribed to pregnant women.  Given the evidence before us that 30% to 40% of children whose mothers used the drug during pregnancy have serious issues, is there a clinical reason why it is still prescribed to some pregnant woman?  If its use is uncommon among pregnant women, some are being prescribed it.  Is there an overriding clinical reason that makes the risk worthwhile in those cases or has its usage by such women not been eradicated because not all prescribers are fully aware of the dangers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#F00400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank all present for attending, particularly the witnesses and the parents of affected families.  My view is that, regardless of the causes of the conditions the children have, the State has responsibility to assist those children and their families.  I am a community pharmacist.  I have dispensed valproate for years and have long been aware of the congenital issues with the prescribing of the drug.  In many cases women have been stabilised on the drug since their teenage years and then start a family.  My understanding is that there was a failure in the counselling of women who were taking valproate as to the appropriate treatment for them in regard to a transition from not wanting a baby to starting a family.  Are the HPRA and the HSE happy that that failure has been rectified and there is no chance that any woman who has been long stabilised on valproate will slip through the net and not receive the appropriate counselling?  For some patients, it is the only product that will keep their epilepsy under control.  That causes a serious problem when such people want to start a family.  Decisions must be made in such a situation.  Changing the medication of a woman who is stabilised on epileptic medication while pregnant could be very dangerous to the mother and the developing life in her womb.<\/p><p>As regards the EU-wide response, are the Department and the other witnesses happy that the response in Ireland was as fast and robust as that of our European counterparts?  Are we at the same level as other countries in that regard?  Much information and many bulletins, stickers, leaflets and so on have been sent to community pharmacists and I am very happy to see that happening.  However, it is clear that did not work in the initial phases.  The HPRA statement indicates that the first interventions to get this information out did not have the desired effect.  However, it was done again and seemed to have a better response.  Has there been an assessment of what might be a better response were this ever to arise again?  Is the dissemination of information to patients on this medication best achieved by sending stickers, leaflets and cards and educating pharmacists and GPs?  I suspect that, in this day and age, that is not the best way to make an impact.<\/p><p>As regards the continued review of the product, it is now clearly linked to congenital disorders.  It is very important to point out that it has been so linked since it came on the market.  However, there has been a marked rise from over 10% to 40% in the number of people who have developed mental issues.  What is being done?  In the case of drugs such as isotretinoin, also known as roaccutane, the initial recommendation was that they should not be used by women of child-bearing age, followed by a recommendation that prospective fathers should not use them.  Are the witnesses considering the effect of valproate on sperm generation?  Many girls on the medication were exposed to it <i>in utero<\/i>.  Are such girls now grown up and have any studies been carried out on the effect on their reproductive systems?  Is there any information on the effects on the offspring of mothers who were on the medication?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#G00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I will deal with the questions regarding State responsibility, services and costed services and then hand over to Mr. Murphy.<\/p> <p>  We must consider the issue of the State's responsibility.  We recently met the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and clearly informed him that, as we understand it, the State bears the responsibility to ensure that women and children who have been affected by this drug get answers in terms of accountability.  The Minister has committed to get back to us by the end of May and consider the issue of compensation.  My colleague, Mr. Murphy, will be able to tell us more about what is happening in other jurisdictions on this issue.  France and the United Kingdom are very much moving in the direction of compensation.  There is a mismatch between when the dangers of the drug were known and when patient information leaflets were changed.  There is a huge culpability and liability since 2014, when the EMA had made a ruling but that was not being implemented by a state.  There is clear accountability since that ruling.  This was the first time the PRAC revisited a drug on which it had made recommendations in order to ensure that those recommendations were being properly implemented.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, we heard of a woman in Cork who collected her medication in a plastic bag without a label.  It is a similar situation to that earlier referred to by Deputy O'Reilly.  There must be an investigation into this matter.  We must understand who is responsible.  The families and parents affected are under enormous stress.  As we explained, they are going from Billy to Jack in terms of getting services for their children.  There is no co-ordination of services.  It is extremely difficult to get a diagnosis and many people are leaving work in order to care for children.  The costs are both unbearable and unmanageable.  It is not for us to quantify them.  We are an unresourced body trying to advocate on behalf of women and do not have the resources to carry out that sort of cost analysis.  There is financial cost but also a cost in terms of lives, quality of life and lost and damaged relationships.  The costs to people's lives are immense.  We must establish accountability and make some retribution or redress on that basis.  We hope that there will be a cost analysis on the Cumberlege report, which has just been issued in the UK, because it has been resourced.<\/p><p>As far as I am aware, there has been no resource put into this here.

Our overall position is there is a huge public interest reason as to why this issue should be investigated.  Rather than us coming here today and saying X or Y is responsible, what we need is an independent inquiry to look into these questions and come up with answers.  There are a lot of parties that would need to be involved in that discussion.<\/p> <p>  As for what is happening in other countries, the UK recently announced a review of this drug and a number of other products and drugs with a view to determining whether the State has responded adequately over the years to safety issues.  As part of this review, the issue of a compensation scheme is being examined.  France has gone a step further in that the state there has accepted its responsibility and established a compensation fund of approximately &euro;10 million.  The French Minister for Health has acknowledged that this is merely a starting point.  Crucially, in France there have been moves to involve pharmaceutical companies in the process.  As I understand it, if the pharmaceutical companies do not make an offer of compensation to an individual then the state will cover it.  Obviously, the legal system in France is different to ours.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked when the risks were known.  I am sure the Health Products Regulatory  Authority, HPRA, will have more information on this but from our point of view foetal valproate syndrome was first reported in the early 1980s and it was well established and accepted by the mid-1990s.  There was a key paper on this in 1995, which outlined the many different symptoms that could have been experienced.  It was in the early 2000s that the link with developmental delay, autism and ADHD became known.  We have reviewed the information that was provided on the summaries of product characteristics, SPCs, which are the documents provided to pharmacists and health care professionals about drugs and we have found discrepancies in terms of reporting of risks on those materials compared to the data that would have been known at the time, as well as some variances between what was on the UK data sheets and what was on the Irish data sheets at the same time.  These are all issues that could be looked at as part of an inquiry to establish what may have happened over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Murphy elaborate on the point regarding the differences in the data sheets between the two countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#H00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>For example, there is an increased risk of polytherapy with valproate in pregnancy.

It is important to emphasise that at this point, we have taken the most definitive regulatory step possible.  We have contraindicated the use of sodium valproate - Epilim - in women of childbearing potential unless the requirements of the pregnancy prevention plan are followed.  Following amendment of the licence, it is now a requirement of the licence that the pregnancy prevention plan is implemented, which is an important change.  We have tried communication.

We will be working collaboratively with patient groups and the HSE on this issue.  We received notification last week from the Health Research Board in regard to an application in which we sought to do academic collaborative work with the RCSI that would bring some independent perspective to analyse drug utilisation data to make sure that these measures are effective in practice.  I appreciate that members will have anecdotes of situations where practice needs to adapt.  We need systematic evidence to be generated to ensure the measures are working in practice and that women who are at risk are not being exposed.  We will be undertaking this work with patient groups and academics.<\/p> <p>  The pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee, PRAC, was established in 2012.  It was the product of amendments to European legislation, which I am sure many members have followed.  PRAC was established as a committee independent of the licensing committee.  It was given regulatory teeth and its outcomes are binding.  At the time of its establishment, recognising the public health importance of this issue, this was one of the very first reviews we did.  I am vice chairman of that committee and I am doing all I can to make sure that this is robustly addressed in terms of analysing the scientific data but also following through on other issues.  As rightly said by my colleagues, this is the first example of a referral in which we have undertaken a look-back in terms of whether measures are working or if we need to do more and the answer was yes.<\/p><p>We can only do that using a collective multi-stakeholder approach.  We regulate the products and now need to ensure the knowledge of the harm associated with the medicine leads to changes in clinical practice.  <br\/><br\/>I emphasise and acknowledge that we are talking about a chronic condition.  Deputy Kate O'Connell referred to Isotretinoin, but members will appreciate indications and population.  Acne is very different from epilepsy.  We have concerns and do not want to have unintended consequences.  Switching a woman's prescription from sodium valproate to an alternative requires time, but it requires specialist expertise, in particular.  That is why the PRAC has made it a requirement of the licence that an annual review be conducted by a specialist when sodium valproate is prescribed for women with a credible risk of pregnancy.  That is not a provision attached to a licence lightly; it is simply to recognise the importance of the health risk.<br\/><br\/>Some Deputies addressed the common theme of why identifying the risks had taken so long.  As the congenital defects are visible, members can understand why they were identified early on.  Warnings about such risks were issued right from the beginning.  However, as neurodevelopmental disorders are more subtle, it takes time to make a link with exposure <i>in utero<\/i>.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly made an astute observation on delays, but I wish to emphasis that we are not talking about delays but disorders.  The PRAC has clearly outlined that they are disorders where children do not catch up in their development.  That is something that came through very clearly in patient testimonies.  We understand the magnitude of the risk.  We understood there was the potential for harm if sodium valproate was used in pregnancy.  What we have seen over time is an evolution in the understanding of the risk and its magnitude and the impact on children and their families.  That understanding has been facilitated by the fact that, as a committee, the PRAC has focused on hearing directly from patients.  It has both a public health focus and a patient engagement focus.  The way we conduct pharmacovigilance today differs greatly from what it was in the 1980s.  One aspect is the new data streams, a new willingness to engage with patients to hear about their experiences.  <br\/><br\/>Another aspect is the epidemiology evidence required to make a link.  That evidence was unavailable in the 1970s and 1980s.  The first of the research papers came through around 2008.  It was a Meador et al landmark study which, as some Deputies mentioned, provided the most robust evidence of a causal link between neurodevelopmental problems and the treatment.  There is convergence and an acceptance of the risk.  As Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly mentioned, it is difficult to make a causal link at an individual patient level.  However, we know, based on the epidemiological studies, that 11% of patients have physical defects, about 30 to 40 have neurodevelopmental problems, within which there will be a spectrum, by which I mean that some patients will be more severely affected than others.  The data stream on which we have relied is the epidemiological evidence, rather than trying to make individual causality assessments which, by definition, is very difficult.<br\/><br\/>On the questions posed by Deputy Kate O'Connell, I hope I answered her question about referral to a specialist for an annual review.  I have explained that when treatment is initiated, concern about harm in pregnancy might seem a remote concern.  That is why, as part of the global package of measures, we have advocated for the avoidance of the use of sodium valproate in young females, with a view to reducing the complexity involved for individual patients, given all they could suffer in the healthcare system in having to ultimately transition from one treatment to another.  Our goal into the future is to prevent exposure to sodium valproate in pregnancy.  At one of the stakeholder meetings Mr. Peter Murphy of Epilepsy Ireland said we must move beyond process to impact.

I welcome all of the delegates.  We are all concerned about the tragic consequences and the effect this matter has had on individuals and their families.  Which country first identified the seriousness of the risks involved?  There appears to have been strong support for the drug in Scandinavian countries, but I am not sure whether that remains the case.  The drug is still recommended and used in Iceland.  I know that it was used or used in combination with something else in the 1960s.  Some body somewhere first detected its negative aspects and I would like to know more about the matter.<\/p> <p>  Why, when it was first discovered, was no Government health warning issued?  I am not necessarily referring to the Irish Government.  The international community should have recognised the potential risk and applied a health warning to protect both patients and the professionals who might have found themselves in the position of prescribing the drug in certain circumstances. <\/p> <p>  Is the drug permitted for use in all European Union member states?  Do containers containing capsules or tablets display warnings?  If so, when did that take place?  Is the matter in hand?  <\/p> <p>  Negative side effects have been identified.  How long did it take for a warning to be issued to all member states and practitioners throughout the European Union?  It is important that we know such information. <\/p> <p>  There are alternatives.  What are they and how effective are they?  Have they been prescribed and recommended for use throughout the European Union?  Have they been prescribed and recommended for use in this country?  Have GPs and consultants been advised of their potential use and to what extent have they been so advised?<\/p> <p>  On the HPRA's response, it appears on the face of it that matters were beefed up to European speeds.  However, I do not know and would like it to be confirmed.<\/p> <p>  With reference to European agencies, on many occasions we have discussed the effectiveness of the Irish system versus the European system and the need to have one overall system to provide for the Rolls-Royce tests.<\/p><p>Has that taken place in this instance?  In the European system, tests should be well ahead of everybody else and should be on a par with the best internationally.<\/p><p> It was 2009 when some concern arose at European level.  Were warnings issued throughout the system to all European countries?  If not, why not?  Were there any discoveries by the HPRA in Ireland?  <\/p><p> In October 2013, when the concerns were obvious to everyone, how effective a warning was issued throughout the system, to doctors and patients who might have been recipients of this treatment?  How quickly was the warning issued and how effective was it and was it sufficient to alert people to the seriousness of the situation?  Herd protection is one thing but individuals have rights in all systems.  It is not true to say that it was tragic - which it is - but necessary.  There are alternatives, and they need to be examined and treated as equally effective treatments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#J00700","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their very comprehensive presentations.  I know some of them face a difficult task in dealing with this issue.<\/p> <p>  Some of the issues I wished to raise have been raised already so I will be brief.  According to the presentation, since 1993 there are about 400 children with developmental delay and about 100 with physical malformation.  Do we have accurate figures, including for the number of families affected?  Are there situations where there might be more than one child in a family affected?  Every child needs support but it is something that needs to be examined at the earliest opportunity and to ensure that those families have adequate support.  I am interested to know how many families need support now?  What further work needs to be done to try and establish a very accurate figure on this so that the supports can be put in place?<\/p> <p>  I have a general question for Dr. Gilvarry on the overall process in regard to medication and medicines in Ireland.  Over the last two years, we as a committee have come under a lot of pressure to make sure that medication, if one can call it that, be made available in cases where there is no clear scientific evidence that it does not have detrimental effects in the long term.  Here, we have a situation where we have medication that has gone through all the research and development, has been in place and working for 25 or 30 years and problems are arising with it.  Is any process to review medications available in Europe or Ireland, where even if a product is around for 20 years, we might need to review it occasionally?  I know it would be a difficult task because there are so many pharmaceuticals on the market.  Just because a product solves some problems, that does not mean that it might not cause others.<\/p> <p>  When a problem is identified in Europe or Ireland, have we a process that reacts fast enough when deficiencies in what is being provided are highlighted?  Big pharmaceuticals are very well able to defend their positions and they have the power of public relations and so on, to ensure that where any deficiencies are found in a medication, that they are downplayed.  They can put their own pressures on bodies, including us as Members of the Oireachtas that we should back off on raising queries on the issue.  Have we sufficient red alert systems in place?  Is there a need to be far more proactive in that area?  There are so many medications available and we have an issue where one medication may not go with another.  Medical practitioners are always under pressure, and trying to keep them up to date is difficult.  Have we done enough in this area?  We might criticise the HPRA sometimes for not processing a product fast enough, we must be careful to make sure that when products are on the market, they deliver what they say they will.  <\/p> <p>  We need to look at these areas.  There seems to have been a delay in this case.  The information did go out but it is about it going out to the relevant people and being effective in getting the message across to them.  I am not clear about whether the way we did that messaging was effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#K00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I apologise for having cut Mr. McGrane off earlier.

There is always a problem with data collection, in how it is collected and how we centralise the collection of that data, particularly when a drug has a number of side effects.  If it clearly had one side effect, and one side effect only, one would imagine that the relationship would be very clear but this one was different.  Sometimes it causes a physical disability, other times it causes a problem with a child's learning abilities and so on.  Those are very different issues.  The other problem about malformation is that they vary.  For instance, a child might be born with a cleft lip or palate and will go into the service with plastic surgeons, or a child will be born with spina bifida and will be sent off with neurosurgeons.  A child might have a hand or thumb deformity and will be dealt with by an orthopaedic surgeon.  It means that early on, the children will go off in very different directions.  How it will happen that the relationships will be made, and how it is reported centrally, or will it be reported back to the company which makes the drug is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  If the child only has neurodevelopmental problems, they will not manifest early on, they may only develop and become apparent in the second half of the first year when the child is a toddler.  That is well after the pregnancy has ended and the relationship may not be remembered or enough emphasis might not be placed on it.  That leads to discrepancies.<\/p> <p>  With an agent such as this, one needs an association, for starters, that someone has been on a medication during pregnancy and now it is associated with a problem with the child.  One has to look to see if the relationship is clear and the child does not also have some other underlying problems.  That must be tightened up in the future.  Geneticists are the key people to bring closure on a place and to decide that, one needs a genetic input.  As a specialist, I might identify the problem and know there was an association with Epilim, I will put it together but get a geneticist involved to ensure there is no other factor that could have affected the child in the womb, and that no other cause for the malformation occurred in the womb.  That is an important area.  <\/p> <p>  We described a series of 29 cases which were very carefully reported by the group in Crumlin.  That is the kind of model that we would need.<\/p><p> Someone asked what is happening in other countries.  I was speaking to a colleague who is a geneticist in the United Kingdom.  They have processed and evaluated 100 cases.  That would need to happen.  We would need to collate cases where parents have had the issue of Epilim in pregnancy and they have a child with challenges or difficulties.  They would have to go through the system to ensure that the diagnosis is correct for their sake and establish whether the children have some other problems as well.  It would be a great help if that could happen.  There is a model there but we will need clearer figures in future because that has been an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Ms O'Donnell gave evidence suggesting that approximately 400 children may be affected by foetal anticonvulsant syndrome in Ireland but that only 43 have diagnoses.

That is far more likely to be processed and documented.  Let us suppose a child goes home and seems to be okay and is out in the community.  Then let us suppose something is picked up by the public health nurse, for example, something not progressing satisfactorily for a toddler.

They are not much use unless there is a commitment to them in future.  I suspect we would need someone to co-ordinate it nationally.  In my hospital, there are 40 or 50 women who have epilepsy and who are attending the antenatal clinic.  I speak to the obstetricians who work with me.  They tell me that, at the moment, few or none of the patients are on Epilim.  That is mirrored throughout the country.  Let us assume that approximately 400 women throughout the country may have epilepsy when going through antenatal clinics per year.  It is important that they are surveyed from now on to find out whether any of them are on Epilim for an reason, whether from a psychiatric viewpoint or an epilepsy viewpoint.  They are the ideal group that should go into the registry.  We may have two processes in parallel.  One could look at any pregnancies now and in future.

Finally, we need to establish whether the pattern fits.  The type of physical anomalies that these children have are key points.  The shape of the forehead is one such anomaly and there are others issues that parents would be aware of as well.  The idea is that we could put together a reasonable picture of what happened and whether a relationship really does exist.  That would be helpful to families who have a child with a problem.

During the course of the discussion today members have heard about the complexities involved in confirming a diagnosis and in the range of different service needs sufferers may have, from neural developmental to physical.  This poses some of the challenges.  Ms O'Donnell said that the FACS forum met the Minister and he had written to the HSE and has asked about the various clinical leads in the different areas - we can see the multiplicity of disciplines involved in providing care in this regard - and that we would meet with the FACS forum and start the process of identifying the needs and in looking at care pathways.  The witnesses are correct when they say we must establish what the population we are dealing with is.  We are hoping that it is a static population as the procedures outlined today are minimising the risk of future occurrence.  However, we have people whose lives clearly have been massively impacted to date and we need a process for managing them.  To do this, as has been said, we need some form of register.  Dr. Murphy spoke of the value of a register and that it runs into the future and is not a static snapshot in time.  It is about creating and understanding, so we can deal with all the factors.  The process has started.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer because some of the questions are about the confirmation of diagnoses and we do not have the answer to this yet.  Once this information is established the issue of the register becomes easier to manage, in the current phase and into the future.  The development of the pathway will start as soon as we have the engagement with the right clinical specialists and with the FACS forum around the needs that have been identified to date.  The FACS forum is very articulate in putting forward its views, and from this I presume that affected children are being disseminated into the wider system.

If, however, a mother was exposed to a low does for a short period of time during the pregnancy and the child subsequently developed a behavioural disorder, it is much more difficult to attribute the subsequent behavioural disorder with absolute certainty and clarity to the small dose of sodium valproate to which the child was exposed for a short period of time.

The 29 cases referred to in the report were just the number that the study looked at.  Our figures, from Professor Andrew Green chief geneticist in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, tell us that 43 cases have been diagnosed that have come through the genetics department at Crumlin hospital.  Professor Green also tells us that this figure does not include anybody who was not diagnosed via that and who may have had spina bifida, for example.  The estimation of 400 children affected is one we ran by Professor Green.  We extrapolated from the UK figures, where an estimated 20,000 children have been affected.  We looked at the figures over the course of the years since Epilim was introduced in Ireland and we also made allowances for the declining prescription figures currently.  We are happy to share this figure for estimation, which is the most robust estimate we can make at the moment.  We have had some medical opinion on it and they seem to concur that the figure of 400 looked about right.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of diagnosis.  The HSE's perspective in this regard is from a clinical point of view.  I totally understand that the HSE representatives here today are looking at the complexity of the issues and grappling with how difficult it can be to diagnose, but I also want to put a parent's perspective on it.  Parents know their children best.  They very often report to us that their concerns about their children are dismissed, that their expertise in regard to their own children is ignored and that they are batted back out of the system.  We also hear that parents are going to France, Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions, including the UK, because there is a two year waiting list here.  We are concerned that perhaps there may be a reluctance to diagnose because of the complexity of the issues.  These are all aspects that we need to get over.  We need to create a comprehensive system of supports and a clinical pathway for children who are affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan O&rsquo;Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>With regard to the numbers and where the numbers come from, Ms O'Donnell has made the point, but I want to highlight the real significance of gathering the numbers as a very early step in this process.  I am aware it has been discussed a lot here.<\/p><p>A register is already in existence at Beaumont Hospital, which is an epilepsy and pregnancy register.  It is a national register and this is being mooted by a number of parties, including the Department and the Minister, as a potential solution to this.  There are a number of challenges to overcome but the infrastructure is, potentially, already in place.  It only gathers data relating to epilepsy and does not gather bipolar information.  It also only gathers the information for a limited period after a child is born.  The key issue with the register is that for many years it has not been funded by the State but by industry support, which has recently run out.  With investment by the State, there is a framework and an opportunity to transform and expand an existing register to gather data on pregnancies and information on individuals affected, as well as their treatment needs and the effectiveness of their treatment.<\/p><p> We were asked whether we were up to speed in Ireland.  In our response in recent times we have been very much up to speed and the HPRA has been very proactive, as have all parties, in addressing the risk issues.  The key point in respect of the risk for the future is that a lot of things were done in 2014 and a lot of boxes were ticked at that time.  A lot of letters were sent out and information materials were developed and distributed by the HSE and the drug company.  There were drug safety newsletters and changes to patient leaflets and everybody is now aware of this, including specialists and pharmacists.  Sending out information has never been the problem.  The problem is that the information is not getting through, for whatever reason, to some women on the ground.<\/p><p> Every time we in Epilepsy Ireland raise this issue we get two reactions.  One is to ask if we will ever stop talking about it as people feel they already know about it.  The other is from upset individuals like those who, following the \"Prime Time\" programme last year, could not sleep because they had never heard of the issue.  The Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome did a survey of 100 pharmacies last year and found that less than 20% were even aware of the existence of the pharmacy card.  It is not a question of doing things but of monitoring what is being done and the impact on the ground.  We need to know that we will not be back here in two or three years' time having the same conversation.  From the point of view of FACS Forum and Epilepsy Ireland, that is one of the critical questions.<\/p><p> The pharmacy regulator has set specific expectations for pharmacies.  There is a mixture of trust and enforcement and all parties, including the HPRA and the HSE, need to be really clear about what they are going to do if we are still reporting medications going out in bags in six months' time, or the fact that 20% of women are still not aware of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I had asked a question on what penalties there were, if any.

Can Mr. McGrane, speaking specifically for the HSE, say if it is possible that it can be adapted to take account of historical cases, as well as being used for the future?  I appreciate that it may not be always possible to give a 100% diagnosis but if a mother has taken Epilim during pregnancy and has a child with some or all the symptoms as described, would it not make sense to assess the problem in a realistic way and assess its extent?

It is clear that there has been an issue with the dissemination of information, from EMA level down to real-life people, meaning people on the medication were not aware of the issue.  I refer to the recent 20% figure to that effect coming from the UK.  What are the HPRA and the Department going to do to ensure it does not happen again that such a thing takes so long to be felt on the ground?  Many community pharmacists have an area for information and it is their responsibility, along with prescribing doctors, to get the information to people.  There seems to be a deficit in the information getting to people who were on the medication and about to get pregnant or who had already had children.<\/p> <p>  The link with neural tube defects is quite interesting and my understanding is that the rate of neural tube defects is rising here more quickly than in any other European country, partially due to the lack of folic acid supplements in foods.

My understanding is that there were two main pillars to those.  One was on the risk minimisation.  Communication does not seem to have been optimally delivered and the Deputy asked what we are doing differently now.  We are making it a requirement of the licence that these things are done.  I refer to any failure to provide patient cards or failure to provide precise information on the magnitude of the risk.  Use of the medicine in a woman of childbearing potential who is not on effective contraception will be off licence now.<\/p><p>That is a change.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the enablers, we are putting a formal pregnancy prevention programme in place.  That is recognising that there have been deficiencies associated with a lack of clarity on different roles and responsibilities around the patient journey.  What is the role of the regulator, the specialist, the general practitioner and the community pharmacist?  What are the clinical enablers that allow steps to be taken at the appropriate time in terms of decisions on therapeutic options but also information provision?  The new recommendations and the new clarity on the licence, supported by what will be a pregnancy prevention programme that will be branded &quot;Prevent&quot; and that will have a suite of measures that have been fully informed by engagement with patients and health professionals, will be a very substantial change and a framework around risk communication as opposed to <i>ad hoc<\/i>bulletins and the like.  We have to recognise that we are doing this for this medicine because of the magnitude of the risk, which is not neutral in terms of burden.  This is a medicine a woman will be on for a long period of her life and the risk of pregnancy will vary, so it needs to be adapted to the woman's individual circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In terms of moving forward, we have a more robust approach now to communication, at least from the perspective of what we are accountable for, which is the regulation of the product.<br\/><br\/>On the question about the other pillar of risk management, which is around evidence generation and how we research medicines at a population level when we have uncertainties, linked to that is the availability of electronic resources, electronic health records, and having the possibility to research population use of medicines.  In terms of much of the pharmaco-epidemiological research, we have had a lot of discussion on the complexity around interpreting individual cases but we have had studies which can get around many of those issues with sophisticated data linkage.  That is not always possible for every medicine but what is clear now is that for every medicine we have a risk management plan and at the time of initial authorisation we ask about the uncertainties and we plan proactively to reduce those uncertainties.  If sodium valproate was being put on the market today, having seen the non-clinical data and having the concerns about physical defects, we would be requiring the company to do pharmaco-epidemiological studies.<br\/><br\/>I hope I can provide some reassurance that, going forward, lessons have been learned.  We have a much more robust approach to the vigilance of medicines in pregnancy.  Perhaps the thinking in the past was that we cannot research medicines that are used by women who are likely to become pregnant.  There was a reluctance to research.  That has evolved.  We understand that women will be treated for chronic conditions.  They will want to plan pregnancies and they need reliable and complete information on the relative harms for different medicines in pregnancy.  As regulators, we are accelerating efforts, a term used by Deputy O'Connell, and that is a fair reflection.  As part of that, and I do not want to get into regulatory speak, in the next year at the Pharmacovigilence Risk Assessment Committee, PRAC, as well as having the research we are doing at national level, we will be developing a good vigilance practice guideline that will be binding on the marketing authorisation holders.  That will be taken into account in all of the risk management plans and the planning of studies to reduce uncertainty so that we do not see these kinds of issues arise in the future with such a time lapse before we get complete and accurate information on the magnitude of the risk.

We are not in the doctor's surgery when the doctor is prescribing and talking to the patient.  We are not in the pharmacists when the medicine is being dispensed, but all of these are trying to assist us now.  The PSI recently sent communications to other pharmacists to make sure the package leaflet and the patient alert card is given at the time of dispensing, and the head of primary care has written to all the GPs to tell them they need to identify the patients who are on this treatment at this time.  They are following up, which is very good and I appreciate it, with the GPs in terms of identifying the patients who are women of childbearing age whom they have on this medicine.<\/p> <p>  We need help to implement all our recommendations.

The very first question that needs to be addressed in the entire area is how we will address diagnosis of potentially hundreds of cases in a service where, in the national centre for genetics, we have four consultant geneticists, ten counsellors and a waiting list of more than 1,300 people, including about 400 who have been on the list for more than 18 months.<\/p><p>It is clear that the national genetic strategy must be funded, resourced and started.

There are 34 neurologists nationwide but there should be double that number according to minimum guidelines from the British Association of Neurology.  There is a resourcing issue in that regard.

Chiropractors specialise in the assessment, treatment and management of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those affecting the spine and related joints.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recognises chiropractors as primary healthcare providers, safe to practice competently either independently or as part of healthcare teams at a community level.  Chiropractic is statutorily regulated in more than 50 countries around the world.  Ireland remains the only English-speaking country in the world that still has no statutory regulation of chiropractors.<\/p> <p>  The Chiropractic Association of Ireland is the professional association that represents chiropractors and maintains professional standards in the absence of this statutory regulation.  The CAI has 110 members working in private clinics nationwide who deliver more than 600,000 treatments per year to patients with musculoskeletal conditions.  This a significant treatment volume and it is delivered at no cost to the State.  To deliver this level of care effectively, chiropractors require prompt, efficient and well-regulated access to appropriate diagnostic imaging when required.  The European Commission has published training requirements for chiropractors to justify, deliver and refer for X-ray procedures.  Without exception, our members are meeting these requirements.  As part of their five-year, full-time education, chiropractors are trained in the safe and effective use of X-rays and have done so for many years.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, chiropractors have been able to refer patients for X-ray for more than 25 years and a number of our members have also had X-ray apparatus in their clinics licensed by the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, and previously by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII.  One member, as far back as 1991, was licensed by the Nuclear Energy Board.  We have sought regulation of X-ray by chiropractors for more than 20 years.  Members of this committee might be surprised to learn that I made a presentation to an Oireachtas joint committee in 1999 on this very issue of X-ray use by chiropractors.  The record shows that the Chairman of the committee at the time, the late Deputy Sean Doherty, advised that the parties should engage further to resolve the situation ahead of the, at that time, upcoming new regulations.  There are a lot of similarities to the situation we are in 19 years later.<\/p> <p>  There was a period of significant activity around the 2002 regulations.  The Department of Health did undertake to create a register of chiropractors who could take and refer for X-rays.  The CAI fully participated in this process throughout 2003.  Progress was going well but it stopped completely in 2004 for an unrelated reason.  There was a consultants' dispute at the time.<\/p><p>The Department was in dispute with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association over a medical indemnity issue.  As a result, the consultants pulled out of any health committees.  One of those was the medical exposures directive advisory group, MEDAG.  Therefore, the work of creating the register of chiropractors competent to take X-rays and refer for X-ray was never finished.  There was no question at the time that the competencies could not be met.  It was simply that the work was never finished.  We have a very long paper trail, stretching from 2004 to 2006, from the then principal officer in the Department stating the reason for the delay in creating the register was, in fact, the consultants' dispute and nothing to do with chiropractors' competencies or willingness to engage on this.<\/p><p> The correspondence deserves scrutiny because it gives a very clear indication that the Department gave an undertaking, at the start of the process, of regulating chiropractors under these regulations.  Since the time in question, it has been stated that since we are not part of the 2002 regulations, we should not be included in the 2018 regulations but, in fact, the Department has given an undertaking to include us under the 2002 regulations.  Nonetheless, during this entire period, chiropractors have had continued access to private X-ray facilities around the country run by Irish Medical Council consultant radiologists.  Further, some 11 chiropractors have continued to operate their own X-ray facilities, licensed by the RPII or the EPA, in full compliance with SI 125.  These chiropractors participated in a HSE compliance audit in 2012.  It is important to point out again that while the 2002 regulations do not specify chiropractors as practitioners, the HSE nonetheless conducted this audit of chiropractors on the basis that they were, in fact, acting in the role of practitioners and had been doing so for many years.<\/p><p> The audit findings were very good.  They stated very clearly that it is encouraging to note that chiropractors have taken steps to implement quality assurance and safety mechanisms, and that virtually all practices have written protocols with regard to safety, justification and optimisation.  The CAI has endeavoured to self-regulate any gaps left by the absence of the register that was promised in 2002.  We still continue to seek full participation in the relevant statutory structures rather than engaging in self-regulation.  The new regulations, to be signed by the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the coming weeks neglect to include chiropractors under their remit altogether, even though the European guidelines on the training of medical practitioners to carry out these roles make it very clear that chiropractors meet the standards required - in the EURATOM directive and the transposition regulations.  We met Department officials in February and had an exchange of views but we are unaware of any progress made on this to date.  As a result, chiropractors now face being unable to refer for X-ray or take an X-ray for the first time in over 25 years.  The Department is fully aware that the equivalent new regulations in the United Kingdom do specify chiropractors are fully competent to take and refer for X-rays, so it is widely understood that the competencies required for chiropractors in Ireland to carry out the same roles are not the issue.<\/p><p> At this time, we are not seeking any additional rights over and above what was agreed by the Department in 2002.  We are asking for our use of X-ray to be regulated, as we have always done.  We fully endorse the Department's desire to have proper regulation in the area.  We still stand ready to engage on any practical solutions the Department might suggest to resolve matters.  We fully support the statutory imposition of minimum training standards and of required clinical governance and auditing.<\/p><p> I shall now hand over to my colleague Mr. Richard Brown, from the World Federation of Chiropractors.  He will explain the international context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cosgrave","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for permitting me to address them briefly today on the international perspective as it relates to this issue.  The World Federation of Chiropractic, WFC, is the global voice of the chiropractic profession.  We represent the national associations of chiropractors in over 90 countries, spread across seven world regions.  Our role is to advance the chiropractic profession and to promote high standards of education, conduct and practice.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard that there are some 110 chiropractors in the CAI.  Members may regard the profession as small but, in a global context, they will note there are upwards of 110,000 chiropractors in the world today.  Most of these are clinicians caring for patients and their communities.  Others are researchers, academics, health policy experts or public health advocates.  Chiropractic, therefore, is an established, respected and valued global health care profession.<\/p> <p>  Since 1997, the WFC has been an NGO in official relations with the World Health Organization, WHO.  As members already heard, the WHO recognises chiropractic as a primary contact healthcare profession.  Back in 2005, the WHO published guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic.  These guidelines clearly set out the requirements of chiropractic educational programs, which include training on radiation protection, radiography and radiology.  They set out practical training in the taking of X-rays and interpretation of X-rays.  It should, therefore, come as no surprise that the safe and effective use of ionising radiation in the form of X-rays is a core component of every single chiropractic training programme around the world.<\/p> <p>  Quite rightly, members will all wish to be satisfied as to the quality of education of chiropractors.  As they have already heard, chiropractors undergo minimum of four years' full-time education at masters level.  Thousands of hours of basic science and clinical sciences training form the curriculum, and competency is tested at every stage.  Upon graduation, chiropractors engage in continuous professional development, quality improvement measures and auditing of their work.<\/p> <p>  Chiropractic is offered at over 40 educational institutions worldwide.  Three of these programmes are in the United Kingdom, namely, at AECC University College, the University of South Wales and BPP University.  A fourth, at London South Bank University, will open its doors later this year.  These programmes are both nationally and internationally accredited, ensuring quality assurance at a number of levels.<\/p> <p>  Let us return to the issue of X-rays, a critical component of effective and accurate diagnosis.  In the world today, over 85% of practising chiropractors exercise their competency in taking X-rays, interpreting X-ray films and referring for diagnostic imaging, including X-rays.  Chiropractors in every one of the 50 states in the United States, every province in Canada, every territory in Australia, and in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are entitled to take, read and order X-rays.  They take the role of employer, practitioner, operator and referer.<\/p> <p>  In the United Kingdom specifically, a 2006 multi-stakeholder document, Clinical Imaging Requests from Non-Medically Qualified Professionals, contained the policy statement from the Society and College of Radiographers.  It stated it is perfectly in order for radiographers to accept requests from non-medically qualified referers provided the referer is adequately trained and remains competent to refer, and provided that there are written local agreements and protocols.  In the same document, the General Chiropractic Council, which is the regulator, stated chiropractors are autonomous primary healthcare practitioners competent to provide diagnostic triage.  The majority are fully trained to take as well as interpret images and interpret reports from radiologists.  It is stated that when requesting imaging protocols they will provide a clear diagnostic rationale based on a well-founded clinical impression.<\/p> <p>  Back pain is the single biggest cause of disability on the planet.  Chiropractors manage musculoskeletal disorders, including back and neck pain, at all stages of the life course.  Their judicious use of X-rays plays an important role in directing safe, effective care.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues around the world, not least those in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and Australia, many of whom trained alongside CAI chiropractors, are shaking their heads in dismay over the prospect of Ireland seeking to prohibit chiropractors, as highly trained skilled health professionals, from exercising their scope of practice and competency.  The WFC respectfully submits that to do so cannot be in the best interest of either patients or the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Brown"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the committee once again for affording us the opportunity to present our case today.

Will the witnesses explain the number who have and use X-ray equipment?  The issue arises that if people do not have X-ray equipment, to whom would they normally refer people?  Would they refer people to hospitals or private providers of X-rays?  I ask about professional indemnity insurance because I came across a person providing an X-ray service but when an issue arose, it turned out the person did not have that professional indemnity insurance.  I am not talking about a chiropractor in this case, just in case anybody is worried about it.  An error was made in the case I mention and it is a major issue.  I have been very involved in legislation relating to this in the past four or five years to ensure all healthcare professionals have insurance.

I am totally supportive of the need to retain X-ray facilities for chiropractors.  I say this because there is an obvious need to keep the highest possible standards and to have qualifications of international repute.  The degree of training must be observed and updated in line with international standards.  Safety regulations must apply with X-rays at all times.  I strongly urge that in all cases, high standards must apply and there must be a level playing pitch.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman knows, I have on many times in the past criticised the existence of waiting lists for virtually everything in the country but particularly in the health service.  One does not have to wait very long for an X-ray by a chiropractor, which is very beneficial for the patient.  Nobody else seems to worry about such things but the patient is most concerned about that.  A patient can go to a chiropractor and have an X-ray and result within ten minutes.  That does not happen in most other places.  It could and probably should happen but it does not.  I, therefore, strongly support an effort to ensure the full degree of services already available through chiropractors continue to be made available, including X-rays.  This can happen if the adequate qualifications apply to ensure patient and practitioner safety with regard to ionising radiation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#T00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today and I apologise for them being delayed for so long this morning.  The quote mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly was something I pulled from the statement last night as well when I read it.  It is \"we have found no substantive evidence of appropriate training, referral criteria, audit or accountability in published literature from the Irish chiropractic community.\"  Reading around this, it almost suggests that there is no evidence.  Perhaps the evidence is there but it just was not collated or given in the appropriate fashion.<\/p> <p>  Why is Ireland so different from other jurisdictions?  I can only assume it is because there is no undergraduate university course for chiropractic services, so perhaps the profession does not have what pharmacists or physiotherapists have in the form of an academic body in Ireland providing the degree course.  Therefore, we depend on people coming in with training from other jurisdictions.  I completely understand concerns that people may have with ionising radiation X-ray units in clinics but I wonder is there any evidence that those units are not being monitored and manned properly, or that there is any risk to the neighbourhoods surrounding practices with such facilities?  Will the witnesses indicate how many patients the group is seeing on a weekly or annual basis?  They might deem this as taking a weight from the health service by dealing with them in their centres.  I visited a chiropractic clinic recently and was very impressed by the professionalism of the set-up.  It was what I would consider very progressive and like a large GP surgery.  It was not just a fly-by-night operation and the person had practised for years.<\/p><p>Following on from the point on indemnity insurance to which my colleague, Senator Burke, referred, and he was referring to the actual machines, when it comes to something being missed, as can happen in any profession, what is the recourse for the patient?  If an X-ray is taken of a lower back and if the issue is not mechanical but is, for example, cancer and that is missed, is there any example of what happens next?  How is it regulated?  Is there any regulation?  Does it just go into the ether?<\/p><p> I looked at the regulations for here and the proposed regulations for the UK and I am concerned that we seem to be an outlier.  Why can Ireland not match up with what the UK is doing?   Do the witnesses have any suggestions as to how they, as a group, could get their house in order?  They appear to be well trained and providing a good service, but somehow they operate in a grey area and perhaps will become extinct.  Do they have any suggestions as to how, if we as a committee could feed back to the Minister to give the witnesses two or three years to sort out their housekeeping, they could assist us in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#T00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Before the witnesses start answering those questions, perhaps they might refer to the definitions of practitioner and referrer because they seem to be central to the issue with regard to being a practitioner who is entitled to refer for X-rays.

We have never asked to be self-regulating.  We have asked to be within the regulatory remit of this new statutory instrument and the existing one, SI 478\/2002.  We have been left outside this.  We have consistently asked to be included and to be regulated and held accountable.  It is very straightforward.  If we are included in the regulations our members will be held accountable.  Either they are able to perform the tasks as required by statute or they are not, but it does provide a mechanism for the relevant authority, in this case HIQA, to remove anybody who is not able to operate their duties in a responsible fashion.  We feel the lack of statutory regulation of chiropractors' use of X-ray is absolutely undesirable.  We have been on the record for more than 20 years as seeking to be involved under the statutory remit of the appropriate regulations.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding the use of X-ray apparatus by chiropractors, they are acting as referrer and practitioner, much in the same way as dentists and it is quite routine in dental practice.  Chiropractors are trained to interpret the films from a diagnostic perspective, but in most cases radiology reports will also be provided from outside sources.<\/p> <p>  On the insurance front, it is a compulsory requirement for all members of the Chiropractic Association of Ireland to hold malpractice insurance and insurance that will cover any eventuality.  Any of our members using X-ray apparatus is covered under the appropriate insurance.  There has never been an issue arising with regard to insurance and X-ray use by any of our members.  There are 130 chiropractors in the country, 110 of whom are members of our association, which is approximately 85%, and a total of 11 chiropractors in the State are licensed to have X-ray apparatus.  This means 99 chiropractors do not have X-ray apparatus and they have been making referrals to private diagnostic clinics throughout the country.  These include the Consultants Private Clinic in Cork and there is also a large private provider of X-ray and MRI services in the State.  We have access to refer our patients to these facilities.<\/p> <p>  Regulation 14.4 caters for people who are not specified as referrers, and at this point in time I am not specified under SI 478 as a prescriber, as it allows for the radiologist in charge to act as the referrer and receive the referral in the event of a referral being made by somebody like me, who is not listed under the current regulations.  This situation has worked incredibly well for the past 16 years.  I have been referring patients to Irish Medical Council consultant radiologists in the State for 25 years.  I have been receiving reports back from those radiologists, and it has been a fantastic service and access has been great.  We also have the backup and security of a consultant radiologist's report.  This has been working very well, hence the number of X-ray licences issued to chiropractors throughout the country has actually decreased from the 18 licences issued a few years ago to 11 now because there has been good private access and many of our members have utilised this.<\/p> <p>  Things will change after the introduction of the new regulations, if they remain unamended.  I will no longer have the ability to refer to a member of the faculty of radiologists here to have an examination done on a patient.  Instead, I will have to refer the patient back to his or her GP and, obviously, provide all of the clinical information as to why I feel the X-ray would be justified, and the GP may or may not make the referral.  It means every patient will have to take an extra step.  It will delay things and slow them down.  Some patients will end up in the public system again and will congest things further.  The new president of the National Association of General Practitioners recently said patients could soon wait up to six weeks for a GP appointment, which is curious.  It seems very much in contrast to some of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations, on which members of the committee worked tirelessly, to slow down access to diagnostic imaging and delay things.  Chiropractors have been working with these arrangements for many years and it has worked very efficiently to the patients' benefit.  We are not talking about a huge amount of X-rays per year.  We have approximately 600,000 visits per year and we certainly refer a very small percentage of patients for X-ray.  It is thought that at present chiropractors take 3,000 to 4,000 X-rays per year, which is hugely at variance with the 1.5 million to 2 million X-rays being taken by other providers in the State.  We are not talking about a huge number of X-rays but, nonetheless, when an X-ray is required and used it is a very important diagnostic tool to which we must have access.  This change will completely remove access to that diagnostic tool for chiropractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cosgrave"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Cosgrave distinguish between the various types of referrals required?

I can see in the foreseeable future that MRI will be much more readily available and utilised much more often.  MRI does not involve ionising radiation.  Nonetheless, the fact that chiropractors will potentially not be listed as referees under the new regulations could interrupt access for MRI referrals because the assumption is that the private facilities may well be unhappy to take referrals for MRI if chiropractors are locked outside these new regulations completely, even though MRI does not involve ionising radiation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cosgrave","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Reilly asked us to outline training levels, comparing Ireland to Northern Ireland and England.

It is a facility that must be very well maintained, it is absolutely not cheap and, for many people starting practices, if there is a very good private provider run by radiologists in the locale that is willing to accept referrals when justified, that is a very good situation to have.  There has been greater reliance on MRI in recent years as well, so many chiropractors now favour MRI.  This trend will increase, although I do not see a time when X-ray will ever be obsolete as a diagnostic tool.  It has been used by doctors and chiropractors for over 100 years and will continue to be so, although I think the numbers of chiropractors even seeking X-ray licences will come down.

The article claimed there is no improvement in outcomes in the majority of cases and an increase in interventions and surgeries.  This is part of a broader discussion around overdiagnosis.

I am joined this morning by Audrey Hagerty, principal officer, food and environmental health unit, and Siobh&aacute;n McEvoy, chief environmental health officer.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to address them on Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM, also known as the basic safety standards directive.  There will be many acronyms and if there are any the committee needs me to clarify I am happy to do so.  I am pleased to address the committee alongside the faculty of radiologists of the RCSI, which is the pre-eminent medical body to speak authoritatively on the subject of radiation, radiation exposure and its use.  I hope to provide the committee with an overview of the directive and the approach being taken by the Department in its transposition with regard to the designation of referrers and practitioners.  That is the medical chapter of the directive. <\/p> <p>  Overall responsibility for the directive rests with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Department of Health is transposing the medical provisions in the directive into Irish law by way of a statutory instrument that will repeal the existing SI 478 of the 2002 European Communities (Medical lonising Radiation Protection) Regulations 2002 and its amendments.<\/p> <p>  The directive is essential legislation the purpose of which is to protect the public, patients, workers and others from all forms of ionising radiation.  lonising radiation has many beneficial applications, particularly in healthcare.  However, as the use of ionising radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained.  According to the European Commission, medical procedures are the largest man-made source of radiation exposure of the population.  It states that when a medical procedure is initiated and conducted appropriately all medical benefits it provides outweigh the risk associated with the radiation exposure.  Without appropriate precautions, however, patients may be exposed to radiation without real clinical need or benefit, resulting in potential real harm for individual patients.  There is a public health risk if there is a proliferation of radiation facilities and an unjustified increase in the use of ionising radiation.  The directive enhances and strengthens a number of concepts in radiological protection including enhanced justification requirements; it places an increased emphasis on the provision of information on the risks relating to radiation exposure and capturing and reporting on individual patient doses; provisions relating to accidental and unintended consequences are also strengthened.<\/p> <p>  In transposing the medical provisions of the directive, the Department of Health sought the advice of the HSE's medical exposure radiation unit, MERU, and a group it established to inform the transposition process.  The HSE is the competent authority and regulator in respect of the existing regulations, which will change after the transposition.  The Department also worked with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which will be the competent authority in the new regulations, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the basic safety standards directive steering group which comprises the two Departments, HIQA and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is the empowered agency under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It engaged with several professional bodies and other groups.<\/p> <p>  The directive is quite prescriptive and there are only certain provisions where member states have discretion in its transposition.  In order to garner information and views on the provisions where Ireland had discretion, the Department conducted a consultation exercise in June 2017.  It posted the consultation on its website and notified likely stakeholders.  It also sought the assistance of the EPA, which issues licences for the custody and use of ionising radiation equipment, to contact all licence holders to notify them of the consultation process.<\/p> <p>  The designation of referrers and practitioners for the purposes of medical exposures to ionising radiation is one area where member states have discretion, reflecting the subsidiarity in respect of organisation of health services at national level.  The directive defines referrers and practitioners with certain roles and responsibilities attaching to same; member states are required to designate health professionals as appropriate.  In the definition of the directive and transposed in our proposed regulations, a \"referrer\" is a health professional who is entitled to refer individuals for medical radiological procedures to a practitioner and a\" practitioner\" is a health professional who is entitled to take clinical responsibility for an individual medical exposure.<\/p> <p>  For the purposes of transposing the directive, my advice has been that we proceed on the basis that nurses, doctors, dentists and radiographers be designated as appropriate.  The Department sought the advice of the MERU group on the designations and had regard to the consultation inputs.  Several representations have been made to the Department, including from chiropractors, requesting that groups not previously designated be considered to be designated in the new regulations.  It is imperative that the directive is transposed as soon as possible to provide clarity and certainty to the system generally and to provide the best safety protections to people who need to avail of medical radiological procedures.  It is also required to enable HIQA assume its responsibilities as competent authority.  The Department is working to finalise the transposing regulations in the coming weeks.  I am happy to take any questions the Chairman or the committee have about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan and invite Dr. Sheehy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#Y00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to attend.  The faculty of radiologists is the professional training body responsible for the training of radiologists and radiation oncologists in Ireland.  Our members are medical doctors who have pursued specialist training of at least five years' duration following their medical degrees, are deemed competent via a series of examinations and assessments and are ultimately included on the specialist register of the Medical Council.<\/p><p>We are concerned with the safe and appropriate use of radiation in medicine to accurately diagnose and treat patients.  We hold positions on national and European committees that are concerned with radiation protection.  We stay abreast of technological developments to ensure we are practising to current international standards to deliver the safest care to patients in Ireland.  We must participate in continuing professional development, quality improvement and audit to maintain our registration with the Medical Council.<\/p><p> Radiologists and radiation oncologists meet the definition of \"practitioner\" in the new basic safety standards legislation and oversee approximately 2 million examinations per year in this country.  We work alongside non-radiologist doctors, radiographers, medical physicists and nurses to ensure that radiation doses delivered to patients are as low as possible.  This is known as optimisation.  Patients are sent to us for radiologic investigation by medical doctors or nurse referrers for radiologic investigation.  These are known as referrers.  We perform the study if we believe the request to be necessary and appropriate on the basis of referral criteria.  This is known as justification.  In some cases, we may decide that the risk to the patient does not justify the exposure to radiation and we suggest an alternative investigation.  Even at low doses, radiation carries with it a theoretical risk of inducing cancer.  All the professionals we have described are registered members of organisations in this State that demonstrate commitment to training and accreditation.  They participate with radiologists in hospital radiation safety committees and in research and audit.  The recent development of the nurse referrer role is an appropriate model for how to incorporate a new regulated allied health professional into the radiology process.  The training of nurse referrers includes the principles of radiation safety and referral.  Their practice is audited by local implementation groups.<\/p><p> The committee is focusing its attention on whether chiropractors should be included in the legislation as referrers or practitioners.  When compared with the trained and regulated healthcare professionals previously described, we have found no substantive evidence of appropriate training, referral criteria, audit or accountability in published literature from the Irish chiropractic community.  We have no knowledge that the criteria and standards set out as basic in the directive by the European Commission are being met.  We would not regard the self-audit of 2011 as evidence of such.  While we are aware that some chiropractors are practising in a manner that is comparable to referrers and practitioners, this practice is outside the current legislation.  There is no current legal basis for chiropractors to act as practitioners.  This practice has only been maintained because the current legislation has no enforcement provision.  Some radiology departments have performed radiology examinations on chiropractor patients.  In such cases, radiologists have judged that the clinical circumstances for radiographic exposure are appropriate and have taken on the onus of becoming the patients' referrer, which is allowed for under the current law.  It is important to understand that the chiropractor is not being considered to be a referrer.  The radiologist is obliged to follow up the patient if significant findings are detected and further medical treatment is required.<\/p><p> The faculty of radiologists is of the opinion that when people operate outside the law, they make it difficult for those of us who operate within the law to compete for radiation safety resources and equipment, to motivate training of workers and to promote best practices.  The faculty of radiologists regards the oversight of a regulated medical or dental practitioner as essential in ensuring patient safety.  We regard any system of radiation protection as incomplete without clinical governance structures, appropriate training and audit.  We fully support the Minister's position that such basic safety standards are available for Irish patients, as demanded by EU Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM.  These standards were first incorporated after the directive in 1997 and legislated for in 2002.  The new directive raises the bar on such requirements.  People who did not meet the standards and operated outside the law in 2002 are not likely to meet the higher standards of the new legislation.  We regard the provision for enforcement by the independent regulator, HIQA, as the major difference in the new legislation, which the faculty of radiologists wholeheartedly welcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Sheehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The first three members from whom I will take questions are Deputies O'Reilly and Durkan and Senator Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#Z00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for the evidence they have given.  I might not be able to wait for answers after I have asked my questions because I am supposed to be somewhere else.  I apologise in advance if I have to leave.  I will be able to catch up on the answers that are given.  My first question is a fairly basic one.  We heard from representatives of the Chiropractic Association of Ireland just before the current group of witnesses came before us.  They advised us in fairly plain language that they are more than willing to be bound by any regulations that are deemed necessary.  They told us they would have no difficulty complying with any standards that the Department or the RCSI might want to set out.  They said they would have no difficulty moving away from the current model of self-regulation.  They have assured us that it is a fairly robust model.  They held their hands up and fully accepted that there may be a need for further regulation.  As someone who represented workers for a long time, I can assure the committee that it is rare enough for a group like this to embrace regulation.  Dr. Holohan might agree that the opposite is generally the case.  People do not usually embrace regulation as wholeheartedly as the chiropractors have indicated they are willing to do.  Could the witnesses comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Sheehy referred to a lack of evidence of appropriate training.  The chiropractors would cite the example of someone who is trained to a certain level and is practising in Dundalk.  If the rules change, he or she might not be able to practice here but will be able to go 10 miles up the road to practice in Newry under the same regulations.  It seems to me that this is something of a discrepancy, given that we are talking about an actual individual who could practice in both jurisdictions.  The regulations are not different.  The same EURATOM regulation applies.  I ask the witnesses to explain their position in that context.  I understand that the training received by chiropractors meets the 2014 education guidelines of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.  Maybe the witnesses have an alternative view.  They might advise us of that.  I am aware that chiropractors use the iRefer guidelines.  I am not a professional in this area.  As I understand it, those guidelines are considered to be an industry standard.<\/p> <p>  I know the association has written to the Minister and is patiently awaiting a reply.  I appreciate that the Minister is busy and that is fine.  Dr. Holohan might be able to advise us on the status of that correspondence.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the national radiation safety committee.  Obviously, this is all about ensuring that patients are as safe as they absolutely can be.  I understand that the committee will sign off on any legislation that will have to be transposed.  I am not quite sure exactly what its role is, how it is constituted or what its status is at the moment.  I understand it was dissolved, perhaps not fully, before being reconstituted but I am not clear on that.  Given that we are here to discuss issues of patient safety, it would helpful if we could receive some advice in that respect.  I am informed that the national radiation safety committee will be considering issues relating to the impact of the transposition.  If this process is not finalised, what exactly will the committee be considering?  Will it be considering the final draft?

Where and from whom did the original request in relation to this directive come?  Did it come from Europe?  Did it come from a particular country in Europe?  Did it come from this country?  It seems to me from my experience with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs that most directives usually originate back home and do the circuit before they come back.  This allows us to blame Europe for introducing something for which we had devolved responsibility to Europe, or which we had approved.  I do not want to put any of the members of the committee or of the HSE expert group on the spot, but I would like to know whether any of them has ever had to seek the assistance of a chiropractor.<\/p><p>The witnesses have had complaints lodged with them, with the Health Information and Quality Authority or others regarding use of X-ray equipment and the extent of the use of X-rays by chiropractors.  Have they ever had complaints made against general practitioners in the HSE for either the excessive use of X-ray services or the reading of X-rays?  Have they received complaints regarding the ability of existing practitioners covered by the directive and by all the regulations?  I recall at least one case not very long ago with respect to which there were very considerable reservations about the reading of X-rays.  It must be fresh in all our minds.  I would like a response to that question.<\/p><p> Have the witnesses received complaints from rival practitioners?  I ask that in the broadest sense.  Our competitors, even in politics, always keep us on our toes.  Sometimes complaints are made by competitors as to the extent to which one does or does not do his or her job, as the case may be.  What is the extent, if any, to which complaints have been made by competing practitioners?  <\/p><p> My final point relates to HIQA.  Some of us have had concerns about the extent to which HIQA, in the past, has applied rules and regulations in certain areas, which I do not propose to go into now.  Dr. Holohan will be familiar with them, particularly regarding accommodation for elderly people in nursing homes, etc.  I would not necessarily always agree with the conclusions HIQA reached.  I am not a practitioner but neither are those in HIQA.  That is the extent of my questions although I may come back in at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#Z00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I call Senator Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#AA00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for the work they do.  Sometimes we have medical practitioners before the committee and we do not acknowledge their work and the contribution they make to our healthcare sector.  It is important that we do so.<\/p> <p>  We heard from the representatives of the Chiropractic Association of Ireland earlier this morning.  One of my questions related to insurance, which is a big issue that has been on my desk for quite a while.  In fairness, the regulation covering medical practitioners is in place and it provides that every medical practitioner must have insurance.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill in 2012, which was eventually adopted by the Department and has now gone through the whole process.  The representatives of the chiropractors advised us this morning that every one of their members has professional indemnity insurance.  We are talking about 130 practitioners who are providing a service to the public.  They are saying they are regulated in the sense of it being within their own organisation and profession to such an extent that each member has professional indemnity insurance.  I am concerned that they are being excluded from a regulation, which makes sure that the standard they have set themselves is maintained.<\/p> <p>  If they are delivering a high level of service, and some of them are providing an X-ray service, have radiologists come across litigation involving chiropractors where professional radiologists had to give evidence in such cases?  If that has not occurred, why can we not incorporate them in the regulation?  We are talking about a very small number of practitioners.<\/p> <p>  Chiropractors will be prevented from making referrals.  The witnesses have said that where medical practitioners refer people to radiologists for X-rays, the radiologist reviews whether the X-ray is necessary.  If chiropractors refer people for X-rays, what is the concern about regulating them in the sense that they are referring people to professionals who can review and decide whether it is appropriate that an X-ray should be carried out?  A radiologist would sign off on that and if the radiologist is happy that it is a reasonable request, what is the concern about including chiropractors in the regulation?  That is an important question.  We are talking about 130 practitioners in total and about 11 who provide radiology services.  It is a very small number.  With respect to the 11 practitioners who provide radiology services, we all know that radiology equipment costs a huge amount of money.  It is a matter of whether we will now have 11 practitioners who will no longer be able to use very good equipment and it will simply be parked.  We are not talking about hundreds of practitioners but about a very small group and about including them in the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#AA00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>To complete the questions, a representative of the chiropractors stated that in 2002 the Department of Health undertook to include chiropractors under the remit of the current regulations by creating a register of chiropractors competent to take and refer X-rays but this work was not completed by the Department.  Dr. Holohan might comment on what the problem was in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Is there a commitment in the Department to the setting up of a regulatory body for chiropractors?  Is there an impasse, a commitment or a problem in that respect?.  Why is that not happening?  We heard from a representative of the chiropractors that even though there are 130 in the country, they order about 4,000 X-rays a year, which is a fraction of the total number of X-rays.  Therefore, it is not a huge issue.  Obviously it needs to be regulated but it is not a large number of X-rays from a body which is highly motivated and highly skilled.  Perhaps Dr. Holohan might answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#AA00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members for their questions.  I will work my way through the questions one by one if that is in order.  I am happy for colleagues from the faculty to interject as they see fit in terms of what I say and some of the questions that would have been referenced to them.  I always have the challenge of reading my writing with respect to the questions raised.<\/p> <p>  First, regarding the lack of evidence that Deputy O'Reilly raised around appropriate training, the reality is that we have no understanding of training arrangements for chiropractors in this country.  They are not part of either the formal healthcare system or, to my knowledge, the formal education system.  We are reliant on the statements they have made in that we have no means, or otherwise, of validating it.  The reality is that they have not been part of our healthcare system.  We have no issue at all with chiropractors, either as individuals or as a collective, but it has never been the case in our healthcare system that they have formed part of what we might call our formal healthcare system.  We understand that we differ in that respect from the UK.  I cannot honestly advise what the policy basis was for the decision to include them in the UK.  I simply know that what was said is true in regard to its standing in the UK.  That is not the case throughout most of Europe and most other European countries are in line with the situation here.  Many of the points made and the questions raised here, and some of the evidence that was given earlier, to my mind relates as much to the existential nature of chiropracty as part of a formal healthcare system as much as to the specific question to which the committee is giving consideration.  During the length of time I have sat on the management team of the Department of Health, which has been quite a number of years at this stage, this question has never arisen.  <\/p> <p>  There was some consideration in the very early 2000s, of which some members may be aware, to the broad question of the inclusion, or otherwise, of a variety of different practitioners, who are not part of the formal healthcare system of regulation.  Nothing was advanced in that regard.  I cannot honestly recall what the nature of the consideration was around that question.  The members might recall that it was part of a commitment, if I remember rightly and I have not read it in recent days, in Quality and Fairness, a health strategy that was published in 2001, but nothing was done to advance that case in specific terms to broaden the system of regulation.  Our regulatory function in the Department has been focused on two broad areas in more recent times.  One is strengthening the basis of regulation of a variety of practitioners who were already regulated.<\/p><p>The latter include the medical profession, the nursing profession, pharmacy and others where a number of different reforms including lay majorities and others have been introduced, with more public hearings, more differentiation between fitness to practice and poor performance and a range of things of that nature.  There is a second strategic intention, which is to broaden the number of practitioners who would be the subject of regulation and those who are part of a formal healthcare system.  That is the work which is under way under the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU.  The council is working its way through 14 different groupings, each of which would be the subject of a separate system of regulation and specification.  None of that architecture or apparatus exists as part of our healthcare system.  While I am not saying that we would not, we do not have any plan or proposal to look at that with regard to chiropractic.  That is a statement of policy as is in the Department.<br\/><br\/>I have no knowledge of the iRefer guidelines to which Deputy O'Reilly referred.  That is the first I have heard of such a thing.  I am not in any sense casting any aspersion on those guidelines.  I have never heard of them and do not know what they are.  We will be back in touch on the matter and will respond to the correspondence shortly.  The Deputy asked a question about the nature of the radiation safety committee.  It will stay in existence until the directive comes into force and new arrangements apply.  The HSE has, <i>de facto<\/i>, been carrying out competent authority functions which it is not effectively empowered to carry out and there is not an appropriate separation of powers between provider and regulator.  The committee may be aware of this being a finding of the inspection done by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2015 when it made some negative findings about arrangements here, including that, that there was not separation between the provider and regulatory function.  We set out the plan that we had at this point to transpose this directive.  We are doing this in our system of licensing, which members may be aware will be before them for pre-legislative scrutiny in the near future.  We published the heads of that before Christmas.  Each of these might provide a mechanism for us to strengthen the oversight and regulation that would apply in this area.  The International Atomic Energy Agency endorsed that strategic direction for how we would propose to respond to the negative findings made at that time.  This work is part of us finalising some of our obligations in that regard.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy Durkan's question about where this originated, it is a process of strengthening and consolidating a set of regulations and updating those that were previously in existence.  That is my best understanding, as opposed to it being something that had a specific origin in a specific member state.  It is part of a set of obligations that we now have, shared with the rest of Europe.  We did not have any different role other than that we may have participated, as a number of experts from this country do, in the development of that kind of knowledge and capacity at a European level.  That is what it would have emerged from.  On the question of complaints, I am not aware that we have ever received a complaint about a chiropractor or, indeed, a GP regarding the conduct of an X-ray.  I am open to correction on that but I do not recall ever hearing of one.  The Department is not a complaint-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>There was one case for the board of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paddy Gilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Gilligan.

I am not suggesting that the Deputy is trying to take us to this territory.  If the complaint relates to overexposure, it is difficult for patients to have any knowledge of exposure and exposure levels.  They put trust in it.  My radiology colleagues will be able to speak on that in a much more informed way.  The challenge in healthcare is often the basis on which patients complain if they are not really able to have a means to understand the nature of the service and the quality thereof.  It can sometimes, but not always, be a useful guide about quality or such.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on HIQA that there has been, on occasion, criticism relating to standards and so on.  HIQA will be empowered to be the regulatory body.  It is doing a substantial amount of work.  We have given substantial new resources to HIQA in the current year to enable it to build its capacity to start the work on developing standards and the competence and capacity to roll this out.  Some of the people it has been able to take on from the formal healthcare system are people with substantial capacity, ability, knowledge and so on.

To answer the Deputy honestly, I have thankfully never had such recourse.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke asked, if there has not been any evidence that radiologists have been called to give evidence of harm, whether that would be a sufficient basis for us.  That would not be a sufficient basis for us to take a step or sufficient grounds for us to incorporate this.  We are not in the business of excluding anybody.  The purpose of this directive is to identify and empower appropriate professionals as either referrers or practitioners, which is what we are doing, and then to empower various competent authorities with the means to be able to ensure that, from the point of view of the protection of the public, the people who are empowered to operate the legislation are the ones operating the legislation and that nobody else is operating it as if they were empowered.  That is the intention.  It is not about any individual grouping or the naming and exclusion of any individual grouping.  It is the empowering of named and identified professionals.  There is also an important point for me to address relating to the Senator's question on referral.  We have an ordinary use of referral, in the way we talk, in that people do get referred.  One person can be referred to another person.  Referral under the Act carries with it privileges that are set out in the legislation.  Referral in the meaning of the directive is not the same in the sense of if, for example, a chiropractor referred a patient to a GP for an opinion.<\/p><p>That could be regarded as a referral in terms of its common meaning but it is not a referral under the legislation.  It is important not to conflate those interpretations.  I do not suggest the Deputy is doing so but it has been done in some public discussion on the issue.<\/p><p> A commitment of which I have seen documentary evidence was made in 2002.  I do not understand the reasons for it not moving forward and am not aware of the discussions in that regard.  Now, a substantial number of years later, any such question must be considered in the context of the directive and a strengthened set of arrangements from Europe that seek in broad terms to tighten up the arrangements that already exist in respect of the use of radiation for the purposes of protecting patients and the wider public from exposure.<\/p><p> As to the wider question asked by the Chair, there has been no commitment to set up a body for the purpose of regulating chiropractors or others.  That has never been expressly considered.  That is not to say that it would not be given positive consideration but, rather, it has never been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#BB02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Dr. Holohan referred to chiropractors as not being part of the formal healthcare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#CC00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524643200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Would they be required to become part of that system in order for them to be regulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018042500002#CC00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Yes.

A comment was made about iRefer.  For the information of the committee, iRefer is a set of guidelines issued by the Royal College of Radiologists in the UK with regard to efficient and safe referral for radiology.  We endorse iRefer, which is an international gold standard.<\/p> <p>  A number of comments made by members, including what Senator Burke said about insurance, come back to the issue of statutory regulation.  As radiologists and other doctors are legally registered with the Medical Council, they need to have insurance.  Doctors who are not part of the Medical Council can be prosecuted.  Issues with poor performance by radiologists, which have arisen in the past, are remediable to the Medical Council.  Doctors can and do have their licences to practice removed or restrained by Medical Council practitioners.  We are not a self-regulating body.<\/p> <p>  The question of the referrers' clause has been clarified by the chief medical officer.  As we said in our submission, there is a huge amount of confusion about the terminology used when someone is doing a referral, doing a prescription or doing a test.  Essentially, in radiology terms, in most cases it is a radiographer who takes an X-ray of one's spine.  A radiographer is not legally permitted to do this unless he or she has received a referral from someone who is allowed to refer under the legislation.  At present, this can be a medical doctor or a nurse referrer.  If a chiropractor sends in a request to a radiology department, the radiologist or the practitioner in charge can look at that request and say that it is justified.  In such circumstances, that radiologist is legally deemed to be giving the referral to the radiographer that permits him or her to perform the examination.  Our understanding is that this will continue under the new legislation.  This practice should not change, as we understand it, but perhaps that can be clarified further.<\/p> <p>  The final question that was asked related to competing practitioners.  This is not the issue for us.  As we heard in previous testimony, most of the radiology examinations referred by chiropractors are being done in the radiology system.  A small volume of studies is being done outside of that.

We have submitted a short statement which sets out a high level outline of the approach we take and how our systems have evolved over the past number of years through the various storm events and other incidents.  I am joined by Eamon Gallen, who is general manager and was previously responsible for customer relations; Katherine Walshe, the head of asset operations; Suzanne Collins, who is responsible for stakeholder and media relations; and Michael O&lsquo;Leary, who is responsible for environmental regulation, which includes public health, an important consideration during these events.<\/p> <p>  We have developed incident management procedures that are in line with international best practice for utilities.  They are based around a co-ordinated approach headed by a central crisis management team, with regional crisis incident management teams in place in all the regions.  The focus is clearly on the mitigation of risk and trying to minimise the impact on customers, recognising that these types of events have adverse impacts on the services and therefore on communities and businesses.  In the early days of Irish Water, we experienced Storm Darwin, which was a significant wind event in the south and south west.  That tested the procedures to some degree and probably laid the foundation for the process we have today, which is based around an incident management framework which has a clear governance structure and ties together all the principal capabilities of the organisation.<\/p> <p>  Working closely with local authorities is a key item.  One of the key lessons from some of the early events, particularly the event in Staleen, was the deployment of specific individual incident liaison officers with each local authority.  That provides the continuity and alignment of information and activity so we work coherently together.  Single points of engagement with other key stakeholders are critical.  The principal ones are the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Health Service Executive, HSE, as well as ESB Networks in a particular way because of the degree of interdependence we have with the ESB for power supply.  Effective linkage with the national emergency co-ordination committee is a powerful co-ordinating mechanism for the major national events we have had in the recent past.  We have a full-time operational planning and emergency management function, which is within Katherine Walshe's remit.  That has the responsibility to develop procedures, regular dry runs and all the contingency planning one would expect a utility to carry out for the type of events we will inevitably experience, particularly weather events and failures of critical assets.<\/p> <p>  At the heart of everything is effective customer and community relationships, particularly for the category of customers who are classified as vulnerable and have particular dependencies on water services.  We work closely with the HSE and community groups to try to identify who those groups are and to ensure we can provide services, including alternative water supplies where that is important.  We try our best to keep customers informed through the various communication channels at national, regional and local level with the best information we have to hand.  During emergencies, things are often very fluid and it is not always possible to have precise, accurate and up-to-date information, but we have got better at doing that particularly through the deployment of the incident liaison managers in the individual local authorities.<\/p> <p>  A key part of the process is carrying out post-incident reviews.  There has been no event to date from which we have not learned significant lessons to integrate into the procedures.  One area of development in the past few months has been the development of specific supplier frameworks so we can call down tanker deployment, water services, standby generators and so forth by having suppliers who have stocks of those in particular areas of the country where we can have them deployed quickly.  The issue of power supply is critical.  Many of our plants are in relatively remote locations and can be difficult to access at critical times.  We are examining the generator strategy we have deployed.  Not all of our plants have generators, although many do, so fitting generators in all the critical plants and at critical pumping stations is a key objective.<\/p> <p>  With regard to resilience, there is a broader question, which we are addressing all the time through the asset investment process, which is to look at critical assets that lack redundancy or are in danger of failure and could have a big impact.  What happened in Staleen is an example of that.  Part of our ongoing work is the identification of these critical assets and carrying out models to examine single points of failure and where we need to build further redundancy into the assets.  That is part of the ongoing investment process.  Obviously a key part of that is, for example, the replacement of high burst frequency pipelines.  We have replaced approximately 800 km across the country up to the end of last year.  These pipelines typically have been the high frequency burst pipes that have been causing maximum inconvenience to customers.  We are also developing our national telemetry centre.  This provides us with online information on critical assets and how they are performing so we can respond both generally and particularly during emergencies and see what is happening at treatment plants, pumping stations and so forth and what levels of water we have in reservoirs.  That information is not necessarily available to us at present across the asset base, but it will be over the next couple of years.  We have much of it already but we are building it all the time.<\/p> <p>  Storm Darwin was a significant event in early 2014, principally in the south west and south.  It was the first major event where there was close correlation between ESB Networks and ourselves.  We developed very good relationships from then which have stood us in very good stead.  I will speak briefly on the Staleen event because it was a significant failure of a major pipeline.  We have pipe failures every day and we manage to repair the vast majority of them within the timeframes we give to the public, but the Staleen event brought home the fact that one can never be certain that one is in control of these events.  In that case, the local authority had carried out a repair on the pipeline 12 months earlier.  We understood the necessary specialists were on site and the crews went about their work.  We were criticised later, rightly, for not mobilising the crisis management team earlier.  However, on the Friday and the Saturday we had a full expectation that the repair would hold, but it did not.  When it did not we knew by Sunday that we had a major crisis and mobilised the crisis management team.  We learned some significant lessons from that, including that as a senior management team we have to be in touch with any significant failure that is happening around the country and we have to be sure that the repair is going to work and, if not, we must be prepared to mobilise the crisis team at very short notice so we can put all the support mechanisms in place.<\/p> <p>  The scale of that outage was very significant, affecting 70,000 people, and it went on for almost a week.  It really brought home the critical importance of drinking water for the ordinary business of life, running businesses and public health.  Indeed, after five or six days, it becomes apparent that one is getting close to a public health emergency.  When toilets cannot be flushed and roof tanks have emptied, it is a very serious situation.  At that stage, one is into crisis response in a serious way to try to avert a public health crisis.  It shows the absolute criticality of water services being reliable so they can be expected to perform throughout the year and of the necessary resilience being in place so that when there is a major crisis such as we had then we can bring the service back quickly.  The treatment plant in Staleen is a critical treatment plant, one of the top ten in the country.  It is not in good condition.  There is a &euro;20 million upgrade of the plant in progress and we are about to start work on the pipeline replacement, which is important, and the pumping station on the River Boyne.  That scheme will be robust and resilient when it is completed.<\/p> <p>  A key lesson from that was in the area of communications.  We did not have enough alignment between ourselves and the local authority so different messages were going out.  People had different timelines in their heads and were getting different information.  We have done a great deal of work with the local authorities to ensure that area is properly aligned.  We also work closely with elected representatives, both national and local.  We recognise that elected representatives have close connectivity with communities and understand business sensitivities and particularly vulnerable customer sensitivities and can help us in that area.<\/p><p>We now have that relationship in a much better place.<\/p><p> Storm Ophelia was a major event and the first of the recent national emergencies co-ordinated from the centre.  It was a test of the organisation, with a large number of people discommoded for a time.  The vast bulk of those were back in service within three days, which was a considerable achievement.  It was the first operation of Irish Water's crisis management function that ran seamlessly, notwithstanding that there was significant inconvenience for people.<\/p><p> Storm Emma was even more demanding on us.  It had all of the characteristics of Storm Ophelia in the sense that services were knocked out, but there were also the access problems that come with heavy snowfalls.  There was a prolonged crisis at the end, given that we then had a leakage problem.  Demand increased across all schemes by between 10% and 20%.  Any scheme that lacked resilience, such as the greater Dublin area, ran into trouble.  We had a couple of weeks of crisis management, which had a considerable impact on the people sitting around me.  Mr. Gallen and Ms Walshe were on duty throughout the event and must have been exhausted by the end.  I certainly felt exhausted.  I pay tribute to all of our staff who were mobilised during the weather events and to all of the local authority staff with whom we worked.<\/p><p> While we must recognise that a freeze event is something that will always put the water system under stress and that Storm Emma was serious, it would not be regarded as an extreme freeze because it happened in March and was relatively short-lived.  Had it occurred for two weeks in January, we would have had a massive crisis in Dublin.  There are no two ways about it.  As matters stood, 500,000 people were without water for significant periods with all of the inconvenience that this entailed, for example, not just being out of water, but only having dirty water when service resumed, airlocks in systems, the call-out of plumbers, etc.  It was a serious issue for us and our main concern now is to ensure that we have enough resilience in all water supplies across the country to ride out such events.<\/p><p> Irish Water demonstrated through these events the value of the national utility in achieving an effective co-ordinated management during major emergencies, working with stakeholders and local authority partners.  It is critical that the state of the infrastructure be recognised and that, until such time as we can bring it to the right standard at a cost of &euro;15 billion, we will have crises like these and will have to remain alert to our responsibilities in terms of putting contingency plans in place and ensuring our people are up to the challenge.  We will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#D00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I wish to raise two matters.

I am familiar with Mr. Grant.  He has visited D&uacute;n Laoghaire many times and I am sure he has been all around the country.  The transfer of functions that used to rest in local authorities took a long time.  From speaking with councillors, they now see a better relationship, which is welcome.  A new space was created, in that they were ceding functions to Irish Water, to put it at its mildest, and Irish Water was provided with liaison officers instantly.  I encourage Irish Water to have ongoing discussions with local authorities and keep them informed, in particular their elected members.  When they are informed and understand what is happening, they are better able to communicate and act as ambassadors for the facility.<\/p> <p>  I do not disagree with anything Mr. Grant said, but I have been asked to raise a specific issue regarding Galway city, where there is a proposal for an investment programme of approximately &euro;10 million.

Regarding the latter, does he have a target number of locations where permanent generators will be placed or will it be a combination of generators on-site permanently and a framework agreement to acquire additional generators?  Power was a problem during Storm Ophelia whereas Storm Emma presented a different complication, that being, freezing and the consequential bursting of pipes.  I was concerned by Mr. Grant's statement that, had this been a prolonged cold period, it would have had a disastrous effect on the Dublin water supply.  This discussion is evolving into session B of today's meeting, but it is critical that we replace pipes in urban areas like Dublin so that we do not have bursts in future.  On a technical point, are the replacement pipes being laid deeply enough to be protected from frost or do they have the flexibility to move so that they do not burst in cold weather events?  Is there a timeline for the pipe replacement work in Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#D00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Grant and his team for attending.

I am from Tramore, County Waterford, where the local radio station was incredible in supporting its listeners and notifying them of the information Irish Water was disseminating.  That was useful.  Despite the notices, however, people still did not seem to be fully prepared.  That caused me some concern.  Information on simple measures could have been given to customers and businesses in advance so as to allow them to prepare, for example, keeping stores of portable water and, for sanitation purposes, wastewater.  The customer did not have sufficient preparation, which created the types of distress that we heard on radio.  In terms of advance notice, can Irish Water do more to prepare the public and business for events like this and, if so, what would that be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#D00500","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524645000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I apologise, but someone's phone is interfering with the system.

We continue to work on it.  The lines for which Ms Collins is responsible are working better, but we will not be complacent and would welcome any feedback.<\/p> <p>  I am not clear about which investment in Galway city the Senator means.  We have commenced the roll-out of a pipe replacement and water conservation project there.  It is a city with a great deal of leakage and many issues with unquantified services and so on.  It is also a difficult area in which to undertake pipe replacement work.  Like many of our cities, it is unplanned and complicated and the traffic situation is terrible.  That project is under way and will make a significant difference to water pressures and supplies in parts of the city.<\/p> <p>  Overall, we have a good water supply in Galway based on Lough Corrib, but we have considerable problems in west Galway.  We intend to extend the scheme north and west of the city to remove much of the weak water supply in places like Carraroe, T&iacute;r na Fhia and so on that are vulnerable.  That is part of our ongoing rationalisation of water services, particularly supplies.  Some of that rationalisation will take a number of investment cycles, given that a great deal of money will be involved, but we will progress it piece by piece.<\/p><p>On Deputy Casey's questions, Ms Katherine Walshe will give details on standby generation and the availability of generators.  One lesson we learned is that when one does not have generators on site, one has to wire in replacement ones.  We are now putting in plug-in points which will save those three hours spent getting an electrician to a site and wiring in a generator.  We did not appreciate the number of sites which did not have a point where one could plug in a generator.<\/p><p> There is a whole complex set of issues around the cold weather period.  Many of the old cast-iron pipes and newer Wavin pipes put down by developers over the decades were laid too shallow.  What is much more serious is the level at which service connections to houses are laid.  Many of them have been laid only three or four inches deep and are guaranteed to freeze even in mild freezes.  The service pipes are the single largest problem regarding long-term vulnerability of the system to cold weather.  In rural areas, we were 20% up on normal demand during the freeze and 10% in urban areas.  In rural areas, much of it was to do with taps to troughs in fields running flat out which had frozen.  Many of these were picked up on the Monday or the Tuesday when people got back out and we then saw a significant drop.  In the city, it was much more to do with service pipes running in old premises which were not being maintained or visited over the period, as well as the service connections themselves.  There were also problems with leaks with the old cast-iron pipes.<\/p><p> Pipe replacement can only be done at a certain rate.  One does pipe replacement where there are repeat bursts on a regular basis.  We are replacing pipes which burst three or four times a month.  We have 800 km completed so far and we have 1,000 km to do.  A significant amount of that is in the greater Dublin area.  It is not based around individual leaks but multiple frequent failures of pipes which, in turn, impact on communities.<\/p><p> There is no quick-fix to the service connection issue.  We cannot go back.  We must have much better building control and how properties are handed over to householders.  It has been quite shocking so far.<\/p><p> The broader question of climate change is serious.  We have seen more events such as high-intensity rainfalls causing flooding in urban areas.  There is a trend towards drier summers in Dublin, although members might not think so in the recent past.  That will impact on the availability of water locally.  At the other extreme, the fact we have more intense floods means one has to balance the storage reservoirs like in Poulaphouca.  We cannot allow it go too high because we have to ensure that if there is a major flood that it does not overtop the dam and cause a massive crisis.  Climate change has to be factored into all our long-term plans.  It has significant cost implications in how we climate-proof our services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Over the past number of events, we had up to 60 generators which we were able to deploy.

When it takes it out, it takes a long time to recharge and there are many knock-on consequences.<\/p> <p>  We are lucky in Ireland that the majority of premises have 24-hour storage in their tanks.

Farmers and the general public were also of great assistance in rural areas especially.  Reference was made to generators.  In many cases they were brought to sites with the help of farmers.  The one good thing that came out of the storm was the meitheal approach whereby people helped each other.<\/p> <p>  Co-ordination is poor on day-to-day issues.  I am aware of that from calls to my office from people who have contacted Irish Water in writing and by phone but they find it difficult to get any acknowledgement.  They come back to Oireachtas Members or councillors then.  There is some fine tuning to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Casey about pipes, Mr. Grant referred to stopcocks, fittings and the geophysical presence at all installations.  Is that physically possible?  It is a huge issue.  If the snowstorm occurred in January, we would have been in an awful situation because most stopcocks are just barely under the ground.  I walked down a street near the D&aacute;il where roadworks and building works are ongoing due to the Luas and my conclusion is that the pipe infrastructure is very airy fairy.  It is very exposed and there is not much cover.  I know asbestos pipes do not shatter but pipes will break with sufficient weight on them.  The infrastructure in many villages, towns and cities is very poor given the amount of lead services and asbestos pipes.  It is prone to ordinary leakage.  It was mentioned that pipes are replaced where there are a couple of leaks per month.  I am aware of cases where there are a couple of leaks per month.  When one turns off the water, one shatters the line back further and it leads to continuous leaks and outages.  I would welcome some idea of the replacement programme and the kind of investment that is needed.  We will discuss the situation in Dublin later.  The pipes must be a priority because it is pointless putting treated water into faulty pipes.  That is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into a discussion about paying for water today but I believe lack of access to the meter is a huge difficulty in terms of the public having an awareness of leaks and usage, especially given that the new meters are so deep.  Could a device not be installed in the home so that people could monitor their own water usage in the interests of conservation?  That would allow leaks to be detected more easily.  We need a similar system to the one we have for gas and electricity meters.  I accept it is something for the future but it should be considered.  One could have a bad leak underground that would be hugely damaging to one's property.  Has Irish Water considered any such issues?<\/p> <p>  I expect most new plants are equipped with generators.  I thank Irish Water for its response to the recent issues in Tipperary with the Fethard regional water scheme and its contamination by kerosene.  I am not being critical, but in terms of design, build and operate schemes, how is Irish Water certain that contractors are undertaking daily site visits?  It has been suggested to me that it is not happening.  I have no evidence in that regard and I do not wish to blame anyone but it is vital in such plants that major environmental disasters like the one to which I referred is detected as soon as possible.  People are scratching their heads and asking questions.<\/p> <p>  The case in Tipperary concerned a new plant that was opened in a blaze of glory last year.  Mr. Grant was there for it.  We spent 40 years trying to get the two plants in Burncoat and Fethard and they were bundled eventually.  It is worrying that, first, this could happen and at such a cost.  Thankfully, no one was affected by the kerosene but the cleaning costs were considerable.  People are still afraid to the drink the water in case it is not sufficiently clean.  There are many design, build and operate schemes.  Mr. Grant said that all the connections are physically monitored and that problems are taken in charge on the day.  That is a very good thing.  However, my concern is whether there are actual bodies on the ground to do that.  I do not believe Irish Water has the personnel even with the help of the county council.  I am not being negative.  Who is watching the design, build and operate schemes?  I know they are meant to be handed back after approximately 20 years in pristine condition and that they can be examined at that stage but who is watching the caretakers who are supposed to be watching out for safety and whatever jobs need to be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#F00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Is Senator O'Sullivan seeking clarification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#F00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I have just one short question about a response in the event of a nuclear accident given that the water systems here are more or less open.

I will get Mr. Gallen involved in some of the customer-related ones in particular and perhaps Ms Collins will say a few words as well on the general communications in response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p> <p>  Generally, in relation to the management and timing of information, there were instances for example in south Dublin where there were difficulties.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin will be very familiar with that.  There were specific access issues into the higher areas in south Dublin.  I will say a couple of things about that.  Early on, I advised that there would be restrictions on supply which I think people interpreted as not losing supply.  If I had the opportunity to do it again, I would make it clear that restrictions on supply mean some people will lose supply, because that is the reality of it.  In those higher areas of south Dublin that is inevitable once one starts to cut the supply and one goes up from Firhouse.  That was part of it.  People expected that they would have some supply.  Also, when one restricts supply and it drops out, it takes time to come back and in some cases when it comes back there are air locks and such issues and then there were access difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Some crews in some parts of the country were extraordinarily busy.  They really had an awful lot of work to do.  Therefore, times were given to us in good faith by local authorities, which we passed on in good faith.  In an emergency one is never sure that the information is accurate.  I wish to make that point.  To an extent, we sometimes perhaps convey the impression that we are definite but we are not always definite.  It is important that we try to give the information with some level of confidence.  I have no complaint to make about any crews because they did a fantastic job and they got there when they could get there.  In terms of the communication from me and from others to say we were going to restrict supplies, we would have known that it means people would lose water but we did not make it quite clear.  We will be clearer in the future.<\/p> <p>  In terms of emergency supplies and tankering, we started out in Staleen with very limited supplies and as a result of that we procured both tanker availability and one tonne containers we can drop into village communities.  We also procured 5 l drums because we realised in Staleen that people do not have sufficiently large receptacles in their house other than pots and pans to bring home water.  It is important to try to deploy those.  We will build stocks of 2 l bottled water around the country and have them available in various locations.<\/p><p>There is no question but that people really do appreciate that help.  When there is a major emergency, the Civil Defence is fantastic at taking water to people.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, neighbours and communities get involved provided they have access to support.  There is no end to the preparation one could engage in.  Ms Walshe and her team continually update information and do dry runs regarding different kinds of scenarios.<\/p><p> The question of what happened with the water is very interesting because we had 60 million additional litres of water leaving the plants.  Where was it going?  One can only draw conclusions based on what happened in the subsequent days.  It was clear that, on the Monday, when all the businesses reopened and the water was turned back on, many taps were clearly turned off, plumbers were busy fixing obvious leaks on private properties, and we were out picking up obvious leaks on the ground.  We got back very quickly to approximately 50% of the initial leakage.  Then the grind got tougher.  Over the following weeks, the fixing of leaks that were showing up or were more easily detectable brought us back maybe another 15 Ml.  To this day, I would say we are still 15 Ml out on what I would call a general leakage.  The disappointing point is that the increase was across the board.  In the 750 district meter areas across Dublin, there was a general increase across the area.  One could not just say a couple of areas were in trouble - everywhere was and this was the trend across the whole country.  The figure in rural areas was up 20% because of the scattered nature of connections and the fact that connections would not always be attended to, particularly those to agricultural fields and premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>What Mr. Grant is saying is that the additional use of water was overwhelmingly attributable to leaks of various sorts, be they private, commercial or public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#G00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>On communications, as Mr. Grant has specified, during a crisis there is always a challenge associated with getting the information.  The crews were out on the ground.  Sometimes the leaks were much more complex than expected.  In Gorey, for example, there was a very significant leak that left approximately 10,000 people without any water at all.  It turned out it was in a forest so the crew had to cut down trees and get JCBs out.  With the best of intentions, one wants to be able to provide as much information and as accurately as one can.  Sometimes, however, the complexity is discovered only when people are on the ground.  In Dublin, between the local authorities and contractors we had, at the maximum, approximately 50 crews out finding the leaks and fixing them.  It is absolutely the case that there was hardship.  The crews were trying to find and fix the biggest leaks first but the information is only as good as our assessment at the time.  We do try to get out as much as we can.<\/p> <p>  The other significant challenge was the network itself.  As Mr. Grant specified, when we put into place the reductions and reduced the pressure, we found people were again out of water in some areas on higher ground, at the extremities of the networks or in apartment blocks where the pumps might not have been working sufficiently.  When customers and local representatives were telling us people were very affected in various areas, we were able to use that information, assess it and make adjustments where the reductions were occurring.  Again, we were trying to communicate this.<\/p> <p>  Bearing in mind that we are talking a lot about leaks and pipework, the size and scale of the challenge we face is such that people do not realise what the issue is until there is a problem.  They probably should not realise it until there is a problem.  For us to communicate to them the size and scale of the problem is a real challenge for us.  We have a very small team.  There are four of us across the whole country.  At times of crisis, hundreds of telephone calls come in.  Regional media, in particular, are invaluable at getting the message out, as are local elected representatives, who use their own networks, and other stakeholder groups on the ground.  We try to leverage everyone we can.  We are very grateful for all the support we get in getting the information out.  In every crisis, we have learned lessons.  The first was in Stalleen.  We got feedback that we were not getting information out quick enough digitally.  We now have an out-of-hours emergency roster for Twitter and for updating our website.  We are building more collateral and producing more information in different formats.  We are trying to use whatever we can to get the information out as quickly as possible and as accurately as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Let me move on to Deputy O'Brien's questions on leakage and mains replacement.  We will get into that in more detail later.  Taking the broad view, in the early days of Irish Water, in 2014, we were inundated with issues concerning asbestos cement pipes and the frequency of failure in many parts of the country.  It was not exclusively asbestos cement but asbestos was a particular problem.  The programme has been very popular in the sense that we have been able to deal with very many of the chronic problems that have been ongoing for ages.  They keep turning up, however.  I received a representation recently about a pipe that failed seven times in a month.  That is intolerable.  One might as well have no supply.  Therefore, we are going out to deal with this.  In the past few months, we have had frameworks in place.  We have regional contractors who can go out much quicker.  Therefore, we do not have to tender for each project.  That is a big help.  Obviously, there is a scale one can reach.  We will talk about that.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, pipe replacement is about the replacement of pipes that are rotten or effectively failing all the time.  Normal leakage is addressed by fixing the pipe.  One finds the leak and fixes it.  Let me give an example.  The 150-year-old pipes from Vartry to Stillorgan, for example, are in perfect condition and they will last another 50 without difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>What are they made of?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#G00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>They are cast iron, built in 1865.  They are in absolutely perfect structural condition.  Of course there are some leaks in the pipes but to spend &euro;65 million to replace them would be crazy.  There would be no rationale for that.  What one does have to do, however, is develop very skilled resources to try to locate the individual leaks over the long length of the pipe.  We are seeking to develop a special crew for trunk mains to try to deal with that.  The focus on pipe replacement has to be where there is chronic failure.  The 30-inch main in Swords is a very good example.  There has been chronic failure over many years.  The only way to deal with that is to replace the pipe because of the impact.  It is not a leakage-control measure; it is, in fact, a fundamental service measure.  Leakage, on the other hand, is fundamentally about trying to find buried leaks in pipes based on sound effects detectable at valves, etc.  It is a slow, meticulous job.  A range of capabilities are required.  Data are required in the first place.  The district meters have to be working.  It is very useful to have the domestic meters because they tell a lot about the legitimate demands.  One works back from that to determine where the priority leakages are, and then one does step testing at night to try to narrow down the areas.  Regardless of where one is in the country, that is the process.  We have the same issues across the country.  We have a leakage rate of 45% or 46%, on average, nationally.  In Dublin, the rate is 36% on the network.  That is the challenge we are facing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the greater Dublin drainage scheme, let me outline the plan for wastewater in Dublin.  Wastewater is just as big an issue for us.  The biggest issue at present is getting the plant at Ringsend expanded.  The programme that is under way there will bring the figure from a population equivalent of 1.65 million up to 2.4 million.  That will bring the capacity to treat the water not only up to the level we need for a significant period, but it will also meet a much higher standard.

The objective will be to proceed to construction in the coming years, primarily because we will be limited in the north-west quadrant, which is a huge development area right across the airport zone, in terms of how much wastewater development we can facilitate to get into the centre of the city.  The long-term strategy is to have two treatment plants, with the vast bulk treated at Ringsend.  The Clonshaugh plant will never be more than one third of the size of the plant at Ringsend at its ultimate stage of development.

There was also a question around access to meters and meter data.  I think that is a very important point and one that would be very helpful.  With regard to the question about pipes and stopcocks, when I spoke earlier about the direct Irish Water staff supervising developments, that is for developers.  That is for all developer connections.  We are relying on local authorities for local connections but the specifications are the same.  Those specifications involve an appropriate depth, which is 2 ft. of cover - 0.6 m - to prevent frost heave action.<\/p> <p>  If we look at any town in Ireland, we have the old cast iron in the centre.  I received a lot of representations in Clonmel because not only is cast iron a problem from the problem of leakage, it is a problem from the point of view of corrosion in the pipes so every time there is a loss of supply, we get that coloured water problem, which is due to the disturbance of sediments.  There is a massive issue nationally.<\/p> <p>  The priority in terms of replacement has to be those pipes that fail regularly and destroy service.  Asbestos cement is probably top of the list nationally in terms of that along with some of the very poor quality PVC that went in during the 1970s.  The very old smaller diameter cast iron tends to be a problem while the larger cast iron generally tends to be in very good structural condition and is also a bit easier to find leaks on because there is more of a noise impact that the correlators can pick up.<\/p> <p>  Design, build, operate, DBO, contracts across the country are preforming very well.  I would prefer if we could take them back into direct control but until such time as we build the capability within the utility, we cannot do that.  By and large, they are working very well.  We have a team that supervises the DBOs.  There are penalty mechanisms if they do not perform and pick up on problems.  The maintenance regime is built into the contracts and that maintenance is tracked and we only pay for it when it is seen to be implemented.<\/p> <p>  The issue in Fethard is the kind of thing that is very hard to prevent.  The kerosene leak was obviously something that should never have happened.  The question of it happening should not arise but it did.  If something like that happened in any of our plans, for example, if a tanker turned over on the M4 and its contents got into the Liffey at Leixlip, it would be very difficult to pick that up before it got into the treatment system.  In the case of Fethard, the attendant went to the site, got the smell of it in the tanks and checked the concentrate in the reservoir where there seemed to be a small trace of it.  By and large from all the testing we have done since, it does not appear to have got into the pipes to any appreciable extent.<\/p> <p>  It is terribly important that people understand that the HSE did not lift the restriction until it was certain that the water was safe.  I want to say that to reassure the people of Fethard because the Deputy is right about the plant.  It is a pristine plant and it was a shame that it was destroyed by the kerosene.  We went to enormous trouble and spent an awful lot of money to recover the plant so that it is perfect but it is very important that people are reassured.  We carried out a huge amount of testing for hydrocarbon concentrations and the HSE was totally satisfied.  It does not lift restrictions unless it is 100% sure.<\/p> <p>  In the broader sense, I am satisfied that DBO contracts are very well supervised but I would say that when something like that happens in a river system, it is very hard to detect it at least before it gets into the plant.  We can pick it up in the plant and the standard monitoring systems we have automatically pick up things like the chlorine residual and there are other parameters we pick up automatically.  We should probably look across our plants to see if there is any other monitoring we can put at the inlet that would give us early detection of these things for call out because that is probably the best option.  We will certainly look into that and see if there is more work we can do there.  <\/p> <p>  Nuclear would fall into that category in the sense that if a nuclear accident happened somewhere, we might get some warning of it because it would not be in Ireland.  We are looking to see whether we can pick up but at the end of the day, we could not stop the systems from being contaminated.  There is no way we could stop the systems from being contaminated.

The problem is not a lack of water, only around 43% of the water put into Dublin&rsquo;s water supply system each day is actually used.  Dublin&rsquo;s problems are: excessive leakage; water outages, Dublin&rsquo;s pipes are so old and fragile that when they come under an extra stress such as during a cold snap, they give way leaving Dubliners without water; unreliable water quality, where in low pressure situations contaminated groundwater can leak back into the pipes carrying clean water to Dubliners&rsquo; taps, which Irish Water calls a public health risk which it has to offset through extra chlorination, and; lack of diversification, Dublin currently gets 99% of its water from rivers, leaving Dublin vulnerable.<\/p> <p>  There is a perception that pumping water from the Shannon to Dublin would fix Dublin&rsquo;s problems, that perception is wrong.  The Shannon would offer no diversification away from river water, and the only thing that can stop Dublin having water outages and suffering from water ingress is replacing its pipes.<\/p> <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s mains replacement target is just 1% per annum, meaning some of Dublin&rsquo;s pipes &ndash; which are up to 140 years old - will not be touched for another 100 years.  1% per annum might be viable for the maintenance of an efficient water supply system, such as those in Paris and Frankfurt, where leakage is around 7%, but it is not viable for Dublin.  Dublin&rsquo;s water mains do not need maintenance, they need a major overhaul and this will soon become unavoidable, regardless of whether or not the Shannon project proceeds.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years Kennedy Analysis has produced two separate but related sets of reports.  The first set focuses on Dublin&rsquo;s water pipes.  For years, a key weakness of Dublin&rsquo;s water supply system was its water treatment plants.  Many here present will be familiar with hearing that the treatment plant at Vartry has not been able to cope with an algal bloom.  It is important to be clear that Dublin&rsquo;s various water crises were not caused by shortages of raw water, but rather by infrastructure issues that impaired its ability to treat and deliver that water.  Happily, every major treatment plant serving Dublin has either been upgraded in the last five years, or, in the case of Vartry, is about to be upgraded.  Dublin&rsquo;s water pipes on the other hand remain in a third world state of decay, and this is now the key issue undermining Dublin&rsquo;s water supply.<\/p> <p>  The other set of analysis focuses specifically on the Shannon project.  We have reviewed thousands of pages of reports going back through the 22 year life of this project.  Four of those reports made projections of the growth in Dublin&rsquo;s water demand.  The earlier reports are now known to have contained errors and to have overestimated the growth in Dublin's demand.  One report overestimated the growth in Dublin&rsquo;s water demand by over 470%.  The latest set of analysis is no different.  It contained three key errors which, once corrected, established that there is no need for a project of the scale of the Shannon pipeline.  Full details of each of these are provided in the bundle that I believe members have in front of them, but the following is a brief explanation of these.<\/p> <p>  The first error related to the data that was used for industrial demand or non-domestic demand.  The intensity of industrial water demand in Ireland has been on a downward trend since 1995, the year before this project began.  It has been stated repeatedly that the data used in the analysis for the Shannon project took account of that decline.  However, the data that was actually used took no account of that decline and was produced using an outdated method that is not considered international best practice and of which Irish Water&rsquo;s own independent economic adviser has been highly critical.  This has a significant impact on the bottom line.<\/p><p>The second error related to the data that was used for what is known as \"customer side leakage\", which relates to leaks from inside people&rsquo;s homes and under their gardens.  The analysis for the Shannon project stated that, in 2011, total customer side leakage was 41 million l per day.  However, the recent first-fix scheme has proven that this cannot have been right.  The scheme has so far identified 35,000 major customer side leaks in the water supply area.  To date, only 40% of those have been fixed but over 38 million l per day of water has already been recovered.  Given that 38 million l per day was being lost through just 40% of those leaks, it is clearly impossible that the total volume of leakage was only 41 million l per day in the first place.  To state that again: 38 units is what they have saved and 41 units is what they assumed was being lost in the first place.  Our analysis extrapolates that once the hundreds of thousands of smaller leaks are also accounted for - along with leaks in homes without functioning water meters - the correct figure must almost certainly have been at least 100 million l per day.  This has a major impact on the bottom line because, even assuming nothing more than Irish Water&rsquo;s current leakage targets, an additional 59 million l per day of water will become available at Dubliners&rsquo; taps by 2050 instead of being poured into the ground.<\/p><p> The third error related to double counting.  The analysis for the Shannon project is a supply-demand equation.  It calculates the amount of water that will be available for supply each day, on the one hand, and the anticipated daily water demand, on the other, to determine whether there will be a surplus or a deficit in 2050.  However, in its treatment of outages in particular, the calculations for the Shannon project added in provisions to the demand side while simultaneously deducting provisions for exactly the same thing from the supply side.  This is double counting and mathematically invalid.<\/p><p> Once the errors in Irish Water&rsquo;s analysis have been corrected, it is clear that the Shannon project is mathematically unnecessary.  A smaller and less expensive non-river water solution would secure Dublin&rsquo;s water supply and provide it with much-needed diversification away from river water.  This assumes nothing more than Irish Water&rsquo;s current leakage targets.  It uses Irish Water&rsquo;s data for all other inputs - for example, population growth - and assumes that no more water will be extracted from Dublin&rsquo;s existing water sources than is assumed in Irish Water&rsquo;s own analysis.  If, instead of its existing targets, Irish Water was to adopt ambitious mains replacement targets, which are long overdue for Dublin in any event, then the case for the Shannon project would be undermined yet further.<\/p><p> It is vital that major projects such as the Shannon pipeline are subjected to rigorous analysis.  Spending &euro;1.3 billion on a project that is not needed means that &euro;1.3 billion is not available for projects that are needed, such as replacing pipes in Dublin.  The numbers for the Shannon pipeline do not add up - there is no investment case - so it is vital from the taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view that it does not proceed.  At the same time, the risks to which Dublin&rsquo;s residents and businesses are currently exposed because of its ancient water pipes and almost total reliance on river water must be addressed.  Irish Water&rsquo;s 1% mains replacement target must be challenged and there should be a fresh review of non-river water supply options in the context of correct demand figures.<\/p><p> One final point to note is that Kennedy Analysis found that the consideration that was given to groundwater, or wells, as an alternative water supply option for Dublin was seriously flawed.  We provided the committee with a summary of that in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting.  I am very happy to take questions about that or, indeed, about anything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy and call on Mr. Grant to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#K00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinn of Ervia will give a high-level overview on the economic and planning context and the policy context, and we will then go into some of the detail around demand and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Good morning.  My name is Mike Quinn and I am the group chief executive of Ervia, which is the parent company of the two regulated companies, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. Grant, managing director, Ms Claire Coleman and Ms Angela Ryan from Irish Water to discuss the water supply project for the east and midlands regions.  I would like to thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the opportunity to present the details and status of the water supply project.<\/p> <p>  The recent Storm Emma event underlined that water supply to the greater Dublin area is critical, with 400,000 people losing supply for periods over two weeks because of increased demand.  The situation is unacceptable and is due to the lack of margin of supply over demand in the region.  Irish Water's central message is that unless we resolve that situation, these failures will occur more frequently and with greater severity.  The impact of such failures will undermine confidence in the service, cause extensive social and economic loss and, ultimately, affect jobs now and in the future.  Basically, the water system would become a constraint on economic growth.<\/p> <p>  After the latest - the fourth - round of public consultation, Irish Water has reviewed the water supply project in detail and considered all of the feedback.  Irish Water is now confirming that the planned new water supply from the River Shannon at Parteen is the best way to meet the critical deficit in the east and midlands regions of Ireland from 2025.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the slides we have provided, the second slide details the policy framework.  We are guided by national policy, which is brought up to date in the national planning framework and the new river basin management plan.  Irish Water supports national policy through its water services strategic plan 2015 and the national water resources plan to be published in 2018.  Irish Water has a statutory responsibility to develop its plans and programmes to ensure that present and future needs can be provided for in a secure manner.<\/p> <p>  The third slide shows the population growth to 2050.  Working from the 2016 census data, it is estimated there will be an extra 600,000 of population in the greater Dublin area and a further increase of 120,000 of population in the midlands region.<\/p> <p>  The fourth slide shows today's water availability in the greater Dublin area.  We can produce 598 million l per day of water safely against an average daily demand of 579 million l per day.  This is a wholly inadequate margin which cannot deal with the risks to supply of demand.  In any other water company, this would be considered an emergency situation.  Indeed, Irish Water monitors the greater Dublin area demand balance, including the region's reservoirs, as a first priority every day for this reason.  It is our single biggest risk.<\/p> <p>  The fifth slide shows the immediate projects we are trying to implement in order to maximise existing sources.  We are improving our network capacity and upgrading our plants at Vartry and Srowland to be able to produce about 10% more water.  This will give a maximum of 656 million l per day, which is the limit that will be available until the water services project can be built and put into service.  This, plus leakage savings, will barely meet the growth over the next seven to eight years, so the contingency will remain highly marginal.<\/p> <p>   The sixth slide shows the dependence on the River Liffey.  We depend on the Liffey for 85% of our daily needs and this is based on 41% of the average Liffey flow, which is extraordinarily high.  This is absolutely the limit of what is available, both technically and legally.<\/p> <p>  The seventh slide shows that demand is growing and has outstripped supply.  The graphic shows the steady rise in the average daily demand in the greater Dublin area.  Normal demand reached 577 Ml per day in quarter 1 of 2018, up from 540 Ml per day in 2014.  However, as members can see, the effect of Storm Emma took the demand to 636 Ml per day, which is more than we can produce.  As a result, we had to restrict supply, causing loss of water to almost 400,000 people at peak.  This failure is unacceptable and causes major hardship and loss to communities and businesses.  Without the water services project, this will happen with greater frequency and severity if nothing is done to provide a new source.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Grant will outline the challenge of leakage and the basis for our future demand estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>In terms of the detailed planning that underpins the figures, in the past there have been four major public consultations and many different reports have been issued.  We have endeavoured to clarify and, indeed, refine from time to time the basis of demand and the basis of our plans, with a view to providing maximum clarity as we prepare to submit this project for planning permission.  This also takes advantage of additional data that was available from the feedback and, of course, the planning policy - for example, the national planning framework - as well as census 2016, which underpins the population data in the catchment.<\/p><p> In regard to leakage, when we compute the domestic demand and the non-domestic demand to the most accurate figures available, we estimate that the network system across the greater Dublin area suffers a typical daily leakage of 207 million l, which is 36% of the water provided.  That compares with about 45% or 46% nationally.  We have much higher percentage leakages in places like Cork city, parts of County Cork, Roscommon and so on.  In the past several years we have been doing a lot of work to get our 750 district meter areas, DMAs, up to scratch.  That includes getting them recommissioned, because many of them had fallen in to disrepair, as well as renewing the meters, tying them into the national telemetry system and so on.  As members will know, we have installed about 58% of domestic meters nationally, although in the greater Dublin area that figure is a little lower, at about 45%, taking account of apartments and other constraints.  We have installed a good deal of pressure management, probably nearly to the maximum limit.  Clearly there is a point where pressure control begins to impact on basic customer service, especially in a city with apartment buildings and tall three-storey buildings.  Pressure management has given us some dividend.  Our local authorities have been endeavouring to carry out find-and-fix repairs across the system as much as they possibly can.<\/p><p> We are now about to launch a programme of work which we call our active leakage control programme.  It will run for the next five years up to 2021, and will then be renewed in each successive period thereafter.  This mirrors the best practice approach that has been used right across the United Kingdom, including England, Wales, Scotland and indeed Northern Ireland, to produce leakage figures that are somewhat lower, but which also reflect the difficulty and the period over which those systems have evolved.  Those systems are largely comparable to ours.  They are a mixture of cast iron from the Victorian era, polyvinyl chloride, PVC, asbestos and more recently medium-density polyethylene, MDPE.  The age characteristics and the water characteristics, which give rise to the corrosiveness of metal pipes, are somewhat similar.<\/p><p> The map on the ninth slide shows the typical layout of pipes in unplanned city streets with a multiplicity of services.  That is the reality of what we are dealing with.  The replacement of pipes across 9,000 km of network has to be very carefully targeted and planned.  Replacement of many of these pipes would be subject to constraints arising from working hours, during which access to business and delivery of goods would have to be managed.  Moreover, work could not take place for the whole of December because of shopping in the lead-up to Christmas, and so on.  There are many constraints, not to mention traffic and the impact on communities.  Underlying that is the impact on water users, who would be out of service for long periods.  We have 650,000 individual connections that we are aware of, and we know from the work we are doing in Galway, Dublin and elsewhere that we will only find out about at least 10% of the connections when we go about the work.  It is an immensely complicated job of work.  There are leakages in the bulk system, the transmission and the reservoirs.  There are also leaks and bursts within the pipe network.  A significant amount of leakage is what I call background seepage, that is, seepage at joints, much of which will never be found, economically or technically. <\/p><p> The tenth slide shows a typical excavation in the city streets.  This is largely what we have to deal with.  A multiplicity of services overlay each other in an unplanned way.  We cannot replace pipes without interfering with the communications infrastructure, the gas infrastructure and indeed with the sewer connections, all of which crisscross each other, as we saw during the Luas project.  It is important to understand that for us, as in Britain, recovery of leakage through pipe replacement is at least ten times as costly as recovery of leakage through find-and-fix.  The technical and economic cases for pipe replacement are based on regular failure and customer service.  The case for leakage control is based on finding and fixing the leaks while trying to stay ahead of the rate at which new leaks are forming.  We have looked at London, which has been referenced.  It took 14 years of sustained investment to get London's leakage rate down from 946 million l to 760 million l.  The city's leakage programme replaced 260 km out of 19,000 km.  The highest replacement rate they ever achieved in one year was 1.3%.  Thames Water has pulled back from that approach, because the firm discovered that it was getting very poor value for mains replacement.  It hit 80% of the leakage target that it expected to meet through the mains replacement programme, at enormous cost.  London is now reverting to a strategy based on rolling out more domestic metering, beefing up district meters and going back to the hard grind of find-and-fix, with pipe replacement following, as I have said, for those pipes that are in difficulty.<\/p><p> The graph on the twelfth slide shows the effect of winter year in, year out.  This shows that there is a continuing battle to deal with new leaks.  For example, Storm Emma has put at least 15 million l a day of additional leakage into our system, which we now have to recover.  That sort of thing will happen every year.  Something will happen every year that causes additional leakages, not to mention the day-to-day increase in leakage in the system.  All of that has to be dealt with before leakage can be driven down.  There is absolutely no point in addressing this with a short burst of activity and expecting that to do some good, because it will not.  Any gains will be lost in no time.  <\/p><p> The next slide shows the component parts to our leakage management system.  I will not go into huge detail, but obviously information is the first requirement.  For planning purposes, we use good data on the network that comes from the system and a leakage management system that will predict leakage in every DMA across the country on a daily and weekly basis when we commission it in the next couple of months.  It is critically important that the district meter areas are working.  They are used for step-testing, district testing and water balancing on a local level.  As well as the domestic meters, the renewal of the non-domestic meters which we are currently rolling out will greatly improve the accuracy of our measurement of non-domestic usage.  Then there is the find-and-fix programme.  As I said, in the greater Dublin area that would require something like 6,000, 7,000 or even 8,000 individual holes to be dug in a year.  On top of that, we are replacing 20 to 30 km of pipe at the moment.  That will increase as we identify the pipe that should be relaced as a matter of priority.  We can be absolutely certain that a replacement rate of 1% would be the maximum we could achieve without bringing the city to a standstill. <\/p><p> The graph on the fourteenth slide shows the journey to bring leakage down over the next number of years from the current daily figure of about 207 million l to a figure of 140 million l as a target for 2051. That will involve fixing a volume of leakage three or four times the amount of the ultimate reduction, because of the continually  rising leakage pressure in the network.  Taking these considerations together, the fifteenth shows a profile of the situation that is facing the greater Dublin area between now and 2025.  If growth in water demand is contained to 2%, we will survive until 2025 without the water supply project, WSP, but without any contingency for emergencies of the kind we have had.  That means we will still have the same problem with weather events, whether it is a drought or a freeze.  If our growth in water demand exceeds 2% in period, we will run out of water sooner.  That is the bottom line.  Over the past four years, underlying growth in water demand in the greater Dublin area was 1.9%.  That is how tight the situation is at present.<\/p><p> The sixteenth slide shows the benefitting corridor within the eastern and midlands region.  This area has compelling demand shortages at the moment.  That includes the Mullingar regional scheme which covers a huge area of county Westmeath apart from Mullingar town.  We face major problems in extending the greater Dublin area supply to Ashbourne and Ratoath.  There are also problems in extending it to the Baltinglass area of Wicklow, where we have not been able to find an alternative meaningful source, and to Rathdrum and Aughrim, where very poor supplies are hanging on by a thread.  Those areas should really be supplied from the Vartry system, and will be with the plans we have in place.<\/p><p> The charts show the picture from now until 2025.  The seventeenth slide shows the increase in domestic and non-domestic demand that we anticipate.  This is all in the context of significant social and economic progress in the region, reflected in housing growth and jobs growth.  This will require a very significant and sustainable reduction in leakage, which will have to be ongoing nearly 365 days a year, not just for ten or 100 days of the year.  We are factoring in the fundamental measures that every water utility worth its salt incorporates in its system, namely, a peaking factor that deals with seasonal variations and resilience against events that happen in every water system, like a pollution event or a drought.  Events of that kind will ensure that we have less water in Poulaphouca than we need.  We know from statistics that the current rate of demand from the Liffey would mean four failures in the past 62 years.  At the current rate of extraction, without additional water, we would have had restrictions in Dublin In 1975, 1976, and 1995.  We have a very serious problem that has to be addressed.  <\/p><p> Obviously a project like this is a multi-generational project.  This project will not be built for ten or 20 years.  It will be built for the long term, just like Vartry in the 1860s and Poulaphouca in the 1930s and 1940s.  This is a project that will sustain the region for a very long time.  We have taken 2050 as a reasonable planning horizon.  Over that period, we are projecting domestic demand growth of just under 1% per annum.  Housing will be growing by 1.3% per annum based on the projections.  Non-domestic demand shows compound growth of 1.25% per annum.  That is about half the projected economic rate of growth, reflecting our expectation that water use will be more efficient than a straightforward reflection of the rate of overall economic growth.<\/p><p>That is about half the projected rate of economic growth, which reflects the fact that we expect water use to be more efficient than overall economic growth would suggest.  I have discussed the leakage targets.  We are talking about hitting 20%.  A target of 20% is not achieved in any water utility in any part of Britain or Ireland, with the possible exception of Anglian Water which runs at just under 20%.  We have put in a very modest strategic provision which has been scaled back to 30 million l a day.  As a country with significant water resources in a world which is increasingly water stressed, there is huge opportunity for Ireland to pitch for businesses that have a significant demand for water such as microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, agrifood and so on.  Ireland, along with a limited number of other countries, is in a unique position to avail of that opportunity, particularly in a world in which water scarcity is very much becoming the reality.<\/p><p> To look briefly at how we went about this and at where we are with the current appraisal of options, as I said we initially had seven variations on the Shannon option which were identified as far back as 1996.  I will come back to those in a minute.  We looked at the Barrow and at how it could be combined with the Liffey but the reality is that Poulaphouca is fully filled by the Liffey system.  There is nothing extra we can do in wintertime to get Poulaphouca more secure than it is.  Therefore there is no possibility of running river abstraction beyond what we are taking at Athy without impacting many other abstractions and other uses.  <\/p><p> In terms of groundwater, there are decades of models, testing and assessments which have been carried out on the groundwaters around the greater Dublin area.  In the 1970s and 1980s, prior to current environmental legislation, there might have been some chance of getting water, for example, in the Curragh.  It was tested at various times, although never successfully and with huge opposition from those using the land, such as the equestrian industry, because of the potential impact on the groundwater.  The best example of groundwater exploitation in the region was intended to be the Bog of the Ring.  It was the holy grail.  It was going to produce 20 million l to 30 million l a day.  It got to 3 million l and has now been scaled back to 2.5 million l because the water simply is not there.  At the moment the environmental designations which exist in this area, the horticulture industry in north Dublin and all the various land use activities would mean that, if one had to, at the very best one could get 0.5 Ml from a borehole here and there which could be combined in a very expensive and very complex network in order to get modest amounts of water, but that is as far as one would get.  <\/p><p> There is no major water supply for the greater Dublin area available from groundwater, but it will always be important for local land use.  It is also critically important for the environment of the Pollardstown fens; the Curragh system, as I have said; and so on.  There is a huge number of constraints.  By the way, this groundwater underpins the base flows of the Liffey and the Boyne.  That is the critical point.  Both of those rivers would be depleted by large scale abstraction of groundwater, therefore one would be robbing from Peter to pay Paul.<\/p><p> The situation is similar in respect of desalination.  Desalination is a technically feasible option in countries which have no choice.  It is extremely expensive, extremely complex and difficult to operate.  I recently spoke to both Thames Water and Melbourne Water about their experiences of desalination.  They said that it was horrendously expensive and very difficult to run.  They also said that it is very difficult to get the water quality right for consumption.  We would have to try to blend it with the surface waters.  Running river water provides perfectly good, safe, clean water right across this country.  Whether we are talking about Cork, Waterford, Galway or Sligo, every one of those major schemes works off river water.  Groundwater is the main means of supply in south Wexford and a few other areas of the country, including parts of the midlands, but the rest is served by the run of the river.  There is no suggestion from any scientific person that there is a health issue or a trihalomethane issue with properly treated surface water.  Where we have those problems it is because no proper treatment plants were provided back over the decades.  We are now retrofitting those.  Surface waters are absolutely reliable and safe and we are very lucky to have very good quality surface waters for treatment for use as drinking water.<\/p><p> The bottom line is that all of those options have been looked at exhaustively.  We have a massive problem to deal with.  We have a scheme which has now been identified and which has now been designed in enough detail to be very confident of the cost.  The costing which we now have, &euro;1.2 billion, includes all of the overheads and costs above and beyond construction costs.  Construction costs are still &euro;850 million to &euro;900 million, but all of the other costs relating to overheads, management, delivery, procurement and all of that will bring the cost to about &euro;1.3 billion eventually.  It represents 2% of the Shannon's waters at Parteen, which would be taken directly from the water which would be otherwise used in power generation.  That compares with 41% of the Liffey's waters.  I doubt there is a river in Europe which is used to that extent sustainably.  <\/p><p> On the public consultation, we had a very significant engagement, which is detailed in the report.  We have had more than 200 written submissions.  We are treating every one of those as bona fide.  We have considered them very carefully.  In the detailed written response to those submissions which we have provided we have tried to give factual clear answers to the best of our ability.  There is no question we will not answer on this scheme.  There is no detail we will not stand over.

It is right that the committee should try to scrutinise it to the greatest possible extent.  We all want to do the right thing in our engagements here and with the various parties involved and we are approaching it on that basis.  I acknowledge the extent to which Mr. Grant, Mr. Quinn and their staff have made themselves available to us, both during the consultation and outside of it.  I also acknowledge the amount of work which Ms Kennedy has put into this.  While there has been extensive consultation, the volume of which I do not criticise, there is always the difficulty that, because both Deputies and members of the public do not have the level of expertise which the professionals do, we are always at a disadvantage regardless of the volume of consultation.  Therefore having somebody who is able to bring at least some technical expertise to the debate is helpful.  Whatever Ms Kennedy's view of this project is, it should be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the need to diversify the water supplies into Dublin and the Dublin region and I am convinced that we need to increase the supply.  I just want to say that at the start.  However, I continue to have significant questions about the project which I do not think have been fully answered.  I will run through those questions now so that folks can answer them.   <\/p> <p>  If I can direct some questions relating to Irish Water to Mr. Grant, the first thing is that our understanding when making our submissions last year was that Irish Water would announce its final preferred option around this time last year and that it would move to planning sometime around September, so there has been about a year of a delay.  We understand that part of that is the delay in the legislation around water extraction licensing, but we have also heard many rumours about disagreements between the Department and Irish Water over aspects of the project.  First of all I would like Mr. Grant to explain the nature of the delay.  Also, given the fact that we do not even have heads of a Bill in respect of that extraction legislation, even if Irish Water goes ahead with planning, how does Mr. Grant see the timeline of the project being affected by legislation on which it is dependent, which will be very controversial in itself?<\/p> <p>  I have a difficulty with the use of the word \"demand\".  I know it is one of these smaller issues but \"demand\" suggests the volume of water that people need and use, but we know the demand also includes the 200 Ml or so lost to leaks.  It is important to say that at the start.  I am interested in whether Irish Water has costs for that leakage, whether annual costs or otherwise.  How much is it costing Irish Water to lose that volume of water annually, because it is important for us to factor in those costs when looking at the overall cost effectiveness of the project?  <\/p> <p>  I am also very concerned at the volume of water.  If the project goes ahead and if water starts being pumped from Parteen Weir up to the Dublin and midlands region, how much of that water will be lost both from 2021, when it would begin, and up to 2051?  My estimates are that at least half of it will be lost at the outset and that by the end approximately 44% of it will be lost.  I hear everything Mr. Grant is saying about leaks but again, for the ordinary person in the street, the idea that &euro;1.3 billion would be spent but that at the end of the project 44% of the water pumped from one part of the country to another would be lost into the system is hard for people to understand.  First of all are my figures correct?  If not, can Mr. Grant correct them?  Will he respond to that issue?<\/p> <p>  In terms of pipe replacement, nobody has ever come here and said that we need a short quick burst.  Everybody understands that replacing the pipe system, particularly in the city of Dublin but even in the surrounding counties, will take time.  This project however, will take us through to 2021 and 2051.  It is again difficult for us to accept that programme cannot be accelerated.  I know Irish Water is constrained by the capital investment which the Government has given it.<\/p><p>I have asked this question before but I will ask it again.  If the Government was to say that it was going to provide an extra &euro;100 million, &euro;150 million or &euro;200 million per year to accelerate leakage detection and pipe replacement, could it be used?  The witness has told me previously that it could not be used.  Perhaps he could explain to the committee why that is the case.<\/p><p> A picture of a street was presented among the slides.  The word \"disingenuous\" is unfair but it is certain that the picture presents a worst-case scenario.  Most likely, it depicts a street right in the centre of Dublin city near Temple Bar.  I accept that there are greater complexities in those areas.  However, we are also talking about many residential areas which, I presume, would not involve the same levels of complexity.  I do not want the witness to think that anyone on this committee believes that pipes can be fixed overnight.  If the Government had the political will to provide the funding, surely that could be accelerated.<\/p><p> I am concerned that, rather than accelerating leakage detection and pipe replacement, we might see a slowing down of the process in the context of the comments Irish Water made when we were considering the revised drinking water directive.  During that discussion, the company's representatives said that if additional requirements on capital investment were necessary to meet the requirements of that directive it might mean leak detection and water saving initiatives are reduced.<\/p><p> Can the witnesses discuss aquifers in more detail?  In my submission, I made clear that my main concern is that the report on which Irish Water based comments dates back to 2008.  I am not in any way qualified to comment on whether what has just been said is correct but it seems that a 2008 report could be updated.  Has any consideration been given, as I suggested a year ago, to updating the report?<\/p><p> I am not a mathematician or an expert.  However, I have listened to two very intelligent people who have put a lot of work into their facts and figures and who are telling me two completely contrasting things.  I simply do not have the ability to adjudicate.  It seems that the suggestion that there be an independent assessment of those claims is very sensible.  If the witnesses are as confident as they say they are that their mathematics are correct and that Ms Kennedy's report is wrong, then surely an independent assessment, given the scale of this project and the money involved, would be a sensible course of action.<\/p><p> In terms of broader escalating costs, this State has a history of beginning projects with projected costs and finishing them with significantly different costs.  I refer, for example, to the national children's hospital and the Dublin Port tunnel.  How confident are the witnesses that &euro;1.3 billion is the maximum amount required?  What can they say to reassure us that we are not going to have a repeat of previous episodes?<\/p><p> Ms Kennedy has made very big claims.  I have spoken to many water engineers who are not Irish Water staff, some of whom are quite critical of that body.  Those people accept the need not just for diversification but for increased supply.  Why does Ms Kennedy believe that the committee should accept her arguments and not those of Irish Water, which has skin in the game, and water engineers who are working - day in and day out - on the water crisis in Dublin?  Why should we believe Ms Kennedy as opposed to those people?  Can Ms Kennedy give us her response to Irish Water's comments in terms of the repair timeline and the example of London?  I know she has a different view on that.  Can she respond to Mr. Grant's comments on the groundwater issue and whether aquifers could provide at least some of the additional supply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#M00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for allowing me to substitute for Senator Conway.

I thank all of the witnesses for attending.  I welcomed Irish Water earlier and I want to welcome Ms Kennedy now, along with the guests from businesses in the Shannon region.  I want to ask Mr. Grant and his team about the non-domestic demand analysis.  Indecon made it clear that, in its view, given the population growth, the method for calculating non-domestic demand is not appropriate for Dublin.  What set of data will Irish Water be using in its updated analysis?  Will it be the Indecon sector-by-sector data or the Jacobs-Tobin population growth data?<\/p> <p>  On leakage, the first-fix scheme for recovering customer side leakage recovered 38 Ml daily in 18 months of operation, despite the fact that only 40% of the leaks identified by the scheme have so far been repaired.  The analysis for the Shannon project assumes that the total amount of water being lost to all customer side leakage before the first-fix scheme began was just 40.8 Ml.  It would appear that this data point in the analysis for the Shannon project may have been incorrect.  In its next analysis, what base year will Irish Water be using in the context of assessing the level of customer side leakage?<\/p> <p>  Kennedy Analysis states that the analysis for the Shannon project used data for the costs of leakage recovery from before the installation of meters, when the recovery of water through fixing leaks was much more expensive.  Kennedy Analysis states that the cost as per the results of the first fix free scheme are less than a third of the costs used in the analysis of the Shannon project.  Can Ms Kennedy explain this?<\/p> <p>  Irish Water may state that the cost of recovering water through fixing leaks is cheaper to start with but that it becomes more expensive as time goes on.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the first fix scheme has already recovered three times as much water as the analysis for the Shannon project thought would ever be recovered, factoring in costs.  In addition, the costs of recovery per unit of water under the first fix scheme have actually gone down every quarter.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Grant was very dismissive about the sources of groundwater in Dublin, which I do not accept at all.  Kennedy Analysis states that none of the errors identified in terms of the groundwater analysis that was undertaken for the project have been addressed.  Can Mr. Grant explain this?  I come from County Tipperary, where there are many different sources of water.  We discussed a river source earlier in terms of contamination.  Groundwater sources are very prevalent all over Ireland.  I am sure it is no different in County Dublin.  Bore wells are sunk on a regular basis.  In my area of Clonmel, people are getting huge supplies in this way.  Mr. Grant was very dismissive of those sources.  Half of the population of the countryside, including private homeowners and farmers, are depending on them.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that the Shannon project is all or nothing and that not a drop of water can be delivered until the entire project is completed.  This project will cost the best part of &euro;1.3 billion.  Regardless of how much water must be supplied eventually, it seems to me to be a strange analysis.<\/p><p>It is notable that the analysis produced by Irish Water's two separate advisers reached very different conclusions on the total water needed in 2050.  Indecon concluded that the answer was 207.5 million l and Jacobs Tobin concluded 330 million l.  My understanding is that the analysis for the project required that individual water sources demonstrate the ability to supply 350 million l of water daily on their own in order even to be considered as a potential water supply option for Dublin.  Would it not be sensible to consider several smaller alternatives in combination that could be brought online incrementally?  Could this not also offer Dublin the benefit of diversification away from river water sources and protection in the event of, for example, contamination?  I addressed Mr. Grant earlier about a smaller scheme in my local town where a new plant was totally contaminated by kerosene.  Will Ms Kennedy explain the three errors to which she referred in her presentation and explain the difference between the leakage figure of 57% and the Irish Water figure of 38%?  I note Mr. Grant never mentioned leaks past the meters, in homes, gardens and so on.  There is a big discrepancy in the two figures presented.<\/p><p> Lest I be called out as being anti-Dublin, I am glad Senator McFadden referred to areas outside of Dublin.  We see this every day on all issues.  I am not anti-Dublin one way or another.  I am here to represent the taxpayers and the public.  This is an enormous investment and I simply want proper analysis and proper independent studies to be published before we embark on this project.  As we know, in almost every project of this size, there are huge overruns and huge underestimation of costs.  I honestly believe we must have a further in-depth analysis before the Government allows Irish Water to spend that amount of money to pump that volume of water.  We talked about the leaks but there is also leakage into pipes, to which the witnesses never referred, especially when there are outages.  There is leakage of contaminants into the water system during repairs.  Contaminants can also get in when there is low pressure and huge amounts of chlorine and so on are then used to try to clean that water.  That was not addressed at all.  I understand the use of gravity from Birdhill, but if Irish Water is going to pump this volume of water, the pressure it will put on the system here will cause many of the pipes to disintegrate.  As was said, they are old and antiquated.  Will there be connectivity on this line through the passage of the pipeline through Dublin?  I have heard there will be and I have heard there will not be.  Many of us could run up and down inside a pipe of such a big size.  I believe it would be very hard to make incisions in it to take off connections and control the volume and the pressure.  That has not been mentioned at all.  It has been said on radio by some of Irish Water's spokespersons that it would serve other towns and areas on the pipelines.  Perhaps the witnesses could answer some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#N00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Would Ms Kennedy like to respond first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#O00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Sure.  I will respond first to Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  He raised a question about how engineers are telling him that as things stand on the ground - they are dealing with a very difficult situation - they need increased supply.  It is not surprising they are saying that.  Of all the water going into Dublin's water supply system today, most of it is being lost through leaks.  This does not make the engineers' lives any easier.  They must put a certain volume of water into the supply system regardless of the fact that only 43% of it is actually being used.  The other 57% - and we will come to that number - is disappearing into the ground.  If leakage were much reduced, which it should be, they would essentially have an entire new source of water in reserve that they could put into the water supply system.  Naturally, they are dealing with the real situation on the ground.  Leakage is a key issue and a key part of this.  Another key part of it is the infrastructure.  Historically, as I said, that has been the water treatment plants.  All the major ones have now been upgraded, apart from Vartry, which is about to be upgraded.  The other key part of this is deployment, that is, the ability to move freely all the water that is put into the water supply system around the entire system.  Historically, this has been a big problem.  I saw the figures Irish Water cited in its slides today as water that is available for distribution input.  That is not actually the total water available for supply; that is clearly being deducted for these deployment issues.  Therefore, the numbers the members see in Irish Water's table are not the total numbers.  The numbers from its own report are for 2015, when its production capacity was 623 million l.  I cannot find the correct slide but it cites a much smaller number.  I think I wrote it down; it is 598 million l.  The number that is being cited is smaller than the total volume of water that is actually available for supply, according to Irish Water's data.  I believe this is because Irish Water is reducing that for deployment issues.  Irish Water stated in its final options appraisal report that four major ongoing projects will address these deployment issues and, in its words, make all this water freely deployable throughout the entire water supply system.  These are Irish Water's words, not mine.  Once those four deployment projects that Irish Water has identified have been completed, the job of the engineers on the ground will be significantly easier because they will be able to move that amount of water freely throughout the system.  I think that answers the question about the problems right now.  This possibly relates to other questions as well.  As I said, the Kennedy Analysis position is not that Dublin does not need a supplementary water source - we believe it does - but that, mathematically, in terms of what is needed to be put in, once the infrastructure issues are addressed there will be plenty of water for Dublin.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy then made the point about London, and Mr. Grant has talked quite a lot about London and its leakage levels.  There is a lot to be said on this, and I will try to keep my comments brief.  London is often used by Irish Water as a comparator with Dublin because the supply systems are of a similar age and nature.  London has made great strides in the past 20 years in improving its supply system.  Mr. Grant said that the highest rate at which they have been replacing pipes in London is 1.3%.  I would love to see Irish Water's data for that.  Our understanding, based on data in our analysis, is that the figure is closer to 3%, even in recent years.  London's Thames Water missed its leakage target last year for the first time in 11 years.  As a reaction to this, and as a response to its customers' feedback, it is ramping up its leakage reduction efforts.  In the upcoming window from 2020 to 2025, London, despite the fact that it is now operating at a leakage level around half that of Dublin, will reduce its leakage in absolute terms by 15%.  During essentially the same window - a year later, from 2021 to 2026 - the plan for Dublin is to reduce leakage by 7.7%, that is, half the leakage reduction for a system that has twice the leakage.  To go into London a little more, again, in its efforts to ramp up its leakage reduction, Thames Water has said it is looking to employ more people, to have more feet on the ground and to invest in new technology to allow it to meet its newly upgraded target.  It has published its draft water resources management plan for next year, which anyone here can view.  There is a lot of information in it about its plans on leakage.  It had been planning for that upcoming window to reduce leakage by just 9%.  The answer it received from customer feedback - and it spoke to thousands of its customers - was that leakage is their top priority.  Thames Water therefore increased that 9% target to 15%.  We are therefore talking about far more ambitious targets in London than those we see in Ireland.  Does that answer the Deputy's questions on London?<\/p> <p>  On groundwater, we have raised many issues about the analysis that was done for this report into groundwater.  The only report that was done into groundwater for this project was produced in 2008.  Irish Water's own adviser described that as \"a high, desktop-study level, on limited data\".  The report itself stated it had to rely on studies and data \"that have been collected by many individuals ... for a variety of purposes and therefore will be variable in depth and strict relevance to the main focus of this report\".  The report continues, \"Nevertheless, this is considered to be acceptable for the type and general nature of this report.\"<\/p><p>That report was produced in 2008.  It repeatedly described itself as conservative.  It has also been described as too conservative by many commentators.<\/p><p> The report was constrained in various bizarre ways.  Instead of considering water resources within, for example, such as Dublin's existing water treatment plants or within 80 km of the periphery of the supply area, the report considered a zone centred on downtown Dublin.  That seems strange because everybody knows one is not going to drill a bore hole in downtown Dublin.  The report also set out various tests that were incorrectly applied.  For example, the report identified aquifers.  If one is considering pumping that water to the supply system then for it to be valid option one needs a certain volume of water.  If one considers aquifers that are further away then, legitimately, they need to be bigger. <\/p><p> The report set out what it described as a resource and distance threshold that it then applied.  However, the resource and distance threshold test itself stated that the distance had to be the distance between the aquifer and the point of distribution or use, in other words, the closest point to which one can get into the water supply system, be that the water treatment plant or the nearest part of the pipes.  The test was applied incorrectly.  Instead of measuring that distance it measured the distance from the aquifers to downtown Dublin.  When Irish Water took the project on in 2014 it undertook a desktop or desk-based review of that earlier desk-based study.  Irish Water failed in its review to take account of the fact that by then the nature of the supply area had expanded significantly and also several other matters that I shall describe in a moment.  Let us not forget that the original application found that six out of 19 aquifers that had been identified had potential but the original report said that only six of them were close enough.  If the test had been reviewed correctly at the time of the review by Irish Water then it would have found, by that point, that 11 out of the 19 aquifers were now valid.  The review discarded what was known as a regionally important aquifer.  Notwithstanding that the aquifer then fell within the new expanded supply zone, it was disregarded because it was too far from downtown Dublin.  <\/p><p> Members will have received some background information on groundwater before today.  We raised a whole raft of questions about groundwater, including these errors and several more, with Irish Water.  Not a single one of these errors has been addressed.  Our issue with groundwater is not that things change and there is suddenly more water under the ground today than there was in 2008 or, indeed, in the reports that the 2008 review relied upon.  Our point is that there were errors in the original report and, more significantly, there were errors in the review conducted by Irish Water.  We have flagged these in significant detail and not a single one of our questions has ever been addressed.<\/p><p> In terms of groundwater as a resource, between 25% to 35% of the Irish water supply comes from the ground and in London it is around 30%.  One of the greatest claims for Paris is its diversification and security of supply.  All academics concur that to have security of supply one needs a variety of types of water sources.  Paris gets 50% of its water source from the ground.  There is a significant amount of groundwater located close to Dublin and this very conservative report reached the same conclusion.  It is important that groundwater is reassessed on the correct basis because it would offer diversification and a sufficient supply of water to Dublin once the correct demand figures have been accounted for.  Have I covered all of the questions on groundwater?       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The committee usually finishes its meetings at noon but we are discussing a very detailed topic today.

My first response was they are looking at pumping water to Dublin but how can Dublin possibly need water in response to which I was told that Dublin has a leakage rate of 57% and a proposal to pipe water is being considered.  All of that piqued my interest.  I am very technically minded.  I was a lawyer and my background is in technical forensic analysis.  Instinctively, I downloaded the reports and read them.  As I read each page red flags flew up everywhere.  For example, a summary of a report would fail to accurately reflect the contents and I became interested.

Irish Water produced umbrella reports that are informed by underlying reports from various experts.  The principal report is the Project Need 2015-2050 report.  It was an umbrella report that was informed by two separate reports.  One report was compiled by a company called Indecon, which was an independent economic adviser to Irish Water, and the second report was compiled by Jacobs-Tobin, which was the engineering adviser.  The reports contained more technical data, and tables of numbers etc.  That is where almost all of our data comes from and, to the extent that it is not, it is from other publicly available sources.

This project has lasted for 22 years.  In 2015, the time that the Project Need report was produced, the concept of a benefit corridor was introduced.  The details provided at the time of the report on the benefit corridor were extremely scant and incomplete.  At the time there were tabular statements provided that literally showed question marks or had the words \"not yet available\" written into the columns in the tabular statements.  The details were inadequate.  In our view, there were errors in the analysis that was undertaken for the benefit corridor.  For example, a huge amount of work was undertaken to calculate the water deficit for the greater Dublin water supply area.  They asked themselves how much water people in the area need, how much water is available for supply and what will be the deficit.  On the other hand, the amount of analysis done on the benefit corridor was incredibly scant and literally amounted to a couple of pages.  Instead of looking at a deficit the question asked was what will the total water demand be for the entire area.  A number was produced, adding the demand number to the deficit number, which is like trying to add apples and pears.  It is mathematically invalid to conclude that 330 million l of water per day is needed.  <\/p> <p>  Interestingly, I wish to again refer to the two advisers, Indecon and Jacobs-Tobin, and how to handle the benefit corridor at that time was one of the issues on which they disagreed.  Indecon believed that one needed to take account of water in the area.  That, combined with their approach to non-domestic demand, resulted in two very different conclusions.  Indecon concluded that the need for the greater Dublin water supply area, combined with the benefit corridor, on their base case scenario, was 207.5 million l per day.  Jacobs-Tobin, for exactly the same area, concluded that it would be 330 million l per day.  Let us compare the Indecon figure of  207.5 million l per day, having used the same data but looking at it differently,  with the Jacobs-Tobin figure of 330 million l per day.  A key driver was how can one analyse things connected with the benefit corridor.<\/p><p>I am certainly not Dublin-centric by any means.  I am just looking at what this project is about and that has been my focus.  Does that answer all of the Senator's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Could I ask for a copy of the report?

I do not question the members' bona fides at all but the statements are not reflective of the underlying data and analysis that was carried out over many years by experts and specialists in this field.<\/p> <p>  To Deputy &Oacute; Broin, at a broad level I would say that the project is a scheme for the generations.  This is a multigenerational project and diversification from the Liffey is absolutely critical.  Over the next ten or 20 years we are going to see the bite of climate change on the Liffey, which I think will force us down.  We have reflected that to a minor degree in our longer-term projections of available water in Dublin.  It could be a lot more severe than those projections suggest.  The whole management and oversight of Poulaphouca reservoir between ourselves and the ESB is something we are discussing with them very carefully at the moment.  Every drop of water there is critical to the figures we are banking on.  We welcome all the feedback we have got and view it as critical testing of our approach ahead of the ultimate independent assessment of this project, which is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where every element of the technical evaluation of the project will be tested and I believe will be found to be very strong indeed.  It will be all the better for the fact that so many issues have been raised and worked through by my team and the various experts who have worked on it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of delay and extended time, we consider this to be a massively urgent project but we also recognise that the environmental impact statement, EIS, documentation, the Natura impact statement and all of the planning support documents are immensely complex.  There is a huge amount of survey work carried out on Lough Derg, for example, and a huge amount of environmental modelling.  We have had massive engagement with landowners along the route.  A lot of that engagement around the routing of the pipe, for example, has included in the final analysis tweaking of the pipes around matters which it was very important were identified, constraints we would not have seen at the macro level.  When we get down and talk to people on the ground, they point out features we should try to avoid.  We have worked through that to the betterment of the project.  I am extremely grateful to all of the stakeholders and the great co-operation we have had over the past year or two.  We have carried out a huge amount of survey work, site investigation and so on.  <\/p> <p>  Ultimately, the submission of this to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the middle of 2019 is dependent on the abstraction legislation.  There is absolutely no disagreement whatsoever between us and Government on this project.  The funding of it is included in the national development plan and it is recognised as an immensely critical project.  We did have discussions around the legislative framework within which we would apply for the abstraction licence.  We had a number of options to consider.  The 1964 Act involves abstractions from reservoirs and there is also the 1946 Act.  However, the passage of time and the burden - and benefit - of environmental legislation is such that we need our abstraction legislation updated.  In order for us to take a project of this scale, complexity and importance to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there should be certainty around the legislation.  The commitment from Government is to endeavour to have that legislation in place.  It is not just related to this project but also to compliance with the water framework directive.  It relates also to many other abstractions that we urgently need to progress around the country.  We have many regional schemes that we want to progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Has the Government given a timeline for the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#Q00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The target is the end of the year.  Clearly, that is not in our hands.  There is talk in terms of demand expressed in respect of including litres.  The bottom line is that when the water leaves the reservoir, it goes into the system to be used by consumers.  Losses occur in every water system in the world and ultimately the only guarantee we have that people will have a standard of service is having enough water to meet their needs, whether they leak or waste it or not.  At the end of the day, one neighbour has not got control over another and we certainly do not have control over the water once it passes through the stopcock and enters the property.  We have made incentives available to householders and they have been successful to a degree.  The bottom line is that the interaction with us of householders and businesses to save water and fix leaks is an ongoing challenge.  We do it all the time and work on it every day.  The water that is used by consumers is the demand we have to satisfy if we are to meet the level of service to which we have committed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of losses, we have a very clear view now, based on the best information we have on non-domestic and domestic demand, that 36% of the water is lost in the system.  We intend to bring that down to 30% over the next four to five years, which is a 20% reduction in leakage.  It is 6% of water into supply but a 20% reduction in leakage.  Many of the figures that are being quoted here for leakage reductions are based on reducing leakage by some percentage.  That is 20%, not 6% of leakage reduction if we look at metrics that are quoted for other water utilities.  Our interest is how much extra water we save that is available at the plant.  That is what we have been talking about.  To get to 25% over the longer term will be a massive challenge.  To this day, London is between 23% and 29% depending on the time of year, according to last year's figures.  It has gone back to a point of intensified leak repair as its fundamental challenge at a much greater level.  London is only one of many cities that are comparable in Britain.  Glasgow, for example, has very similar water to Dublin.  Loch Katrine and the Vartry system would have the same quality of water and the same corrosivity issues and they are over 30%.  This is a massive challenge for our types of network, old cities with old and varied pipework.  By the way, much of our problem also relates to new pipework laid by developers over the last three or four decades that was not laid particularly well.  <\/p> <p>  The reality of pipe replacement is that it is very difficult and complex work.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is absolutely right that in the centres of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Blackrock and Dublin it is immensely difficult.  That is where the cast iron is and it where the larger pipes and the larger leaks are.  Back in the 1990s when a lot of work was done in Dublin, almost nothing was done in those areas because it was simply too difficult to face up to.  That has to be addressed now by ourselves and we will deal with it.  We will replace the pipes at a rate that makes sense to sustain the leakage savings we make through the leakage work that we do, just as they are doing in Scottish Water, across Britain and everywhere in the world.  As I said, it makes no sense-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Would Irish Water do it more speedily if resources were made available from central Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#Q00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524645000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Capital is not a constraint on this.  It is absolutely not a constraint.  I cannot predict the future but today, capital is not a constraint.  It is about getting out there with the crews on the ground, finding and fixing the leaks, deploying the technology and building up the capital replacement programme behind it.  We plan to do that steadily but will accelerate it if we need to.  It has to be justified and has to deliver a return.  This is the fundamental point.  We could replace the old Vartry mains into Stillorgan for &euro;65 million but what would we get for it?  Three or four megalitres of savings.  It would make absolutely no sense.  We have lots of very good cast iron pipes in this city that are 100 years old and that should not be replaced and could not be replaced on a value basis because it is not the priority and would not save the water.  Issues like future drinking water do not impinge at the moment on our capital planning.  They have no bearing on it.<\/p> <p>  We could talk about aquifers all day but, as I said to the Deputy, the groundwater bodies around the greater Dublin area have not changed in the last 100 years.  All of the data that was ever produced in terms of modelling and boreholes and so on is collated by Geological Survey Ireland, GSI.  That is their job, they are the specialists.  All the experienced hydrogeologists who have worked on it are basing their work on that data.  For that family of hydrogeologists in Ireland who understand the groundwater issues, the primary issues are related to the yield we can get over the distribution.  The idea that we could identify a borehole, for example, and just pump it into the nearest part of the pipe system is nonsense.  We simply cannot do that.  We must bring the water to a reservoir where it can be blended with the other water and put into supply in a managed way.  Going into Portlaoise we have 12 Ml of water, which is procured over an area of 14 sq. km and then pumped 17 km to the town.  That is the scheme there.  If we try to replicate that for 100, 200 or 300 Ml we are talking about a system that we could never technically develop or manage and for which we would certainly never get approval.<\/p> <p>  In terms of scale, Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned the fact that this is a once-and-for-all scheme.  A new water supply scheme takes 20 years from start to finish.  We have schemes all over the country.  I can think of Clonmel, for example, where a new regional scheme based on the Suir is very urgently required, because there is a very poor quality supply.   We are working on that.<\/p><p>However, it is taking significant time to do the same work that we are doing on this scheme to get it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, hopefully, in the next six to nine months and built over the next six or seven years.  That is the timescale involved.  The scheme is presented as something on a vast scale.  While it is a big project costing &euro;1.2 billion or  &euro;1.3 billion, the Vartry reservoir was built in 1865 with picks and shovels and it served the city for 70 years.  In its day, it was a bigger challenge politically, economically and technically.  When the Poulaphouca scheme was developed in the late 1930s, huge areas were flooded and a massive dam was constructed while there has been significant work since to get the water into Dublin.  The scheme has also broadly served the city region for 70 years.  However, those systems are now exhausted and the deployment work referred to comprises projects we are doing to shift water between the various schemes and make sure the last drop of water we can produce can be delivered, which is the challenge.<br\/><br\/>On the question of <i>per capita<\/i>demand, nobody knows what domestic side leakage is.  Householders fixed leaks and we fixed leaks together in the first fix free scheme throughout the country that saved water, which on the customer meter amounted to 100 million l of which 25 million l were in Dublin.  Less than one third of that was reflected back at the source because when a customer's leak is fixed, the neighbours' water pressure improves and they get a better service.  Other leaks then develop.  It is just like leakage on the system where a dividend of 20% or 30% is generated but then new leaks happen.  Plumbing systems continually develop leaks on washers, WCs and so on.  That goes on all the time.  Every frost causes bursts on service pipes that are too shallow.  That will continue because we will never get to the point where we can replace all of them.  We will have customer side leakage.  It is included in the<i>per capita <\/i>figure in these numbers.<br\/><br\/>This is where we have clarity compared with Britain, for example.  We have predicted the future demand of the domestic population of Dublin and the midlands region at 135 l per head.  If this was done in Britain, they would quote 150 l per head because they use 130 l for metered properties and they assume 160 l for unmetered properties.  We have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that demand will be 135 l per head, inclusive of leakage.  That figure is derived from the customer data we have.  It is a conservative assumption to make and we could not resile from that.  That is the minimum figure used for planning throughout Europe.  A small number of countries can point to lower <i>per capita<\/i>consumption because they have user charges at high rates, for example, Denmark and Germany.  Other than those, 135 l per head, inclusive of leakage is considered a low number to the planning for.  Nobody knows how much leakage there will be in that.  If 20% of that is leakage, that represents 7% or 8% of total water production.  If we could, in turn, find 20% of that, it would represent 2% or 3% of total water production.  That is the reality in respect of 800,000 domestic dwellings in the midlands and eastern region.  Any fast thinking, logistical study of what one might reasonably get back from these, working with each of them as private citizens in control of their own plumbing systems and their own behaviours, would say one would be doing a brilliant job if one could save 1% of that water.  To suggest there is a Holy Grail in domestic leakage is unbelievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will take the final three members as their questions might overlap with some of those previously asked.

I acknowledge the work Ms Kennedy has done on this project, which is a personal crusade she has taken on, and the volume of information she has presented to us.  Anything I say will not be critical of what she has presented.  Water quality, supply and leakage have been referred to in detail but, at the end of the day, if we fix 100% of the leaks, which is probably not possible or never will be possible, and fix the Vartry water supply - I live beside it and I have dealt with the algae bloom year in, year out - with the work commencing to fix that now, additional water will still be needed in 15 or 20 years, regardless of what anybody says.  Sir John Hawkshaw and Sir John Gray sat somewhere in Dublin 150 years ago and decided to build the Vartry reservoir, which we are still using today.  They tried to secure a deal with the canal owners at the time because there was no security of supply from the canals and they built the reservoir.  In 2018, we need to have the vision those men had to secure a water supply not only for Dublin but for the surrounding areas as well.  Nobody at this meeting knows what the population will be or the volume of commercial water that will be needed but in my heart and soul, regardless of how many leaks are fixed and how much our current supply improves, we still will not have sufficient water to deal with increasing need into the future.  We are being asked to make similar decisions to those made by those two men 150 years ago.  I could get lost in figures and go backwards and forwards to argue about waste, supply, population and demand but, at the end of the day, we need a secure supply of water for the country.

Irish Water is getting great headlines again today with the proposed Shannon project.  It is ironic that, for such a small country surrounded by water, we have a massive problem with water supply.  I was in Tempe, Arizona, several years ago, which is surrounded by desert but has an excellent water supply.  Looking at the Shannon as a source of water supply is the way forward.  Taking water from the sea would cost too much with desalination and so forth.  There are also issues with taking supply from groundwater such as lime content and other environmental concerns.<\/p> <p>  It is unfortunate that there is 57% leakage in Dublin.  We need to look at this as it is our capital city.  Mr. Grant said capital is not a restraint.  When I worked with my local authority, funding was always an issue when trying to get a pipe on the network fixed, for example.  Leaking old pipes, particularly in Carlow, are a significant issue.  I know there is work going on to replace them, like the replacement of pipes in Borris recently.  When these works are undertaken, the main streets and the shops are affected.  I met recently with residents in Bagenalstown where there is work going on to replace water pipes.  Several residents asked if those works could have provided an opportunity to lay down a gas connection for the town.  Irish Water&rsquo;s policy is to manage the water infrastructure and services and work with others.  Is there joined-up thinking when such large works are taken on by Irish Water to work with other agencies?  Has it a plan so that when it is pulling up a street or a road to work with other agencies such as Bord G&aacute;is to lay other pipe networks or connections?  There is nothing more annoying for people when a main street pulled up a year ago for water works is pulled up again for another agency.  There is also a cost factor involved.<\/p> <p>  Budgets for projects often double and treble over time.  By 2050, Irish Water hopes to have a significant reduction in leakage.

There are different opinions and projections on non-domestic use.  We have reconciled these in the sense that we scaled back the strategic provision.

This is coupled with 1.25% growth of non-domestic usage.<\/p> <p>  Non-domestic use is well established through metering, although we are now renewing all the non-domestic meters because, as they age, they underestimate.  We suspect that as we get new meters in, this might well have to be increased.<\/p> <p>  The question of water quality was raised and the idea that water can seep into the pipes.  That can only happen if the pipes run out of water.  This is the key point.  If we eliminate outages, then the pressure in the pipes means one never gets back pressures and seepage into the pipes.  There is a risk that if one has repeated outages, because there is not enough water, then there is a possibility that groundwater will get in.  That is why we have chlorine residuals in the water and that is why we monitor water quality after outages carefully.

On radio yesterday, Mr. Grant conceded that the 37% figure did not include a single drop of customer-side leakage.  Customer-side leakage cannot possibly be 5%.  The results of the first fix scheme show us that.  Members can read the results for themselves.  Customer-side leakage is one of three areas and it is impossible that it only accounts for 5%.  It is almost certainly at least 19%.  That is where the 57% figure originates.  According to Irish Water's data, leakage in the UK is 20% on average, so comparing that with our 57% is like comparing apples and pears.  UK leakage is reported on a total basis and includes losses from customers' supply pipes.  To compare total losses in the UK to partial losses in Dublin is inappropriate and misleading.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about headroom.  At the time of the 2015 Project Need report on Irish Water's data, headroom was placed at above 15%.  Anyone can read that data, which I can break down for people.  The analysis of the Shannon project points to a future peak of 12%.  On the radio yesterday and as reported today, the figures were given as 12% and 13% for peaking and headroom, respectively.  Those numbers are wrong.  In the analysis, they are 15% and 20%.  I quickly checked on my calculator, as the other figures were clearly wrong.  The 12% and 13% are a calculation of total distribution input, but that is not how Irish Water calculates headroom and peaking or how it is done internationally.  Net worth leakage has to be deducted.  As such, the figures are actually 15% and 20% of accounted for water.  Irish Water's analysis factors in the fact that 35% must be made available every single day of the year over and above average demand.  That is the headroom.  Our analysis adopts the same requirement.<\/p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is constantly referred to as an option for an independent review.  It is our understanding that our case cannot be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board has a limited remit over what matters it can consider - planning and environmental issues and regional development.  No part of our case relates to any of those responsibilities.  For it to get a fair hearing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la would not be valid.<\/p> <p>  Regarding water ingress, the implication is that there are only outages when there is insufficient water.  We know that that is not the case.  As shown during Storm Emma, outages are caused by pipes breaking.  Water ingress is not limited to a situation in which there is not enough water to enter a property.  Outages happen because cast iron pipes burst and they are 140 years old when their life expectancy is 80 to 100 years.  Perhaps there are exceptions in some parts of Ireland, but this is the main cause of Dublin's outages and the water ingress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#T00900","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Is there something in the policy document on joined-up thinking between agencies, for example, gas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#T01000","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>It was mentioned that the witnesses would revert to the Senator in writing, as that matter was not part of today's discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042500002#T01100","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1524645000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>It is important that the issue be considered.

I will indicate, as I have already to committee members, that those present should put their phones on silent.  Their phones will interfere with the recording equipment in the Houses.<\/p> <p>  The first item is to revisit the committee's report of December 2016 on Garda oversight and accountability and to consider what progress has been made in this area in the meantime, including on the implementation of the committee's recommendations.  Second, we will discuss issues surrounding the recording and classification of Garda homicide figures, including, in particular, the review being conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the classification of homicides and the reasons for the delay in publishing the findings of that review and furnishing a report to the Policing Authority.  Third, we will discuss some ancillary issues which I will not name but which have been flagged to the witnesses and of which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been given notice.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, Assistant Commissioner Orla McPartlin, Assistant Commissioner David Sheahan, Chief Superintendent Brian Sutton, Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, Mr. Liam Kidd, executive director of ICT and Mr. Niall Kelly, head of Garda internal audit service.  Seated behind them are Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications, Superintendent Marie Broderick and Ms Gail Malone.  <\/p> <p>  Before we begin, committee members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Most of the witnesses will be familiar with the privilege reminder.  I draw the attention of our witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the situation with regard to privilege.  They should note they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Before inviting Mr. Finn to make his opening statement it is important, for clarification, to point out that the team presenting this morning is not led by the acting Garda Commissioner, which would have been our expectation.  We only received notification yesterday of the make up of the delegation here this morning.  We understand some media are referencing the acting Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, in this morning's press but I am not personally privy to it.  It would be important to state this at the outset, because this is the second time we have addressed the very important issue of the homicide review, and the acting Garda Commissioner has not been in attendance on either occasion.  I know it is matter of concern to members of the committee and, at the outset, it would be important to clarify whether the acting Garda Commissioner and the deputy Garda commissioner, Mr. Twomey, are indisposed.  We also note the fact Mr. Singh is not here this morning either.  Will the witnesses clarify this for the sake of settling down to the work we have indicated that we would like to address this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018042500002#C00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524643200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>On behalf of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I will explain that the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, is out of the country and, therefore, unable to attend this morning.

Certainly I will communicate back to him the concerns of the committee in this regard.  The committee has asked that we cover a number of items today and the breadth of topics requires a larger attendance than normal.  Given the time constraints for this opening statement, I will provide an overview of each matter and my team with me are more than happy to take further questions on the detail in each of the areas.<\/p> <p>  As previously stated, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the investigation of each and every suspicious death very seriously.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand that any death, regardless of whether it is ultimately deemed to be from natural causes, accidental or premeditated, brings significant pain for the deceased&rsquo;s loved ones and, as such, it is vital they are investigated fully and professionally so families can be provided with all of the answers to their concerns.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that each death is recorded accurately on our computer system, PULSE, to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our stakeholders and society at large has the most up-to-date information available on natural, accidental and suspicious deaths recorded throughout the country at any particular moment in time.<\/p> <p>  As previously outlined to the committee in December 2017, a review team was established under an assistant commissioner and includes experienced detectives and civilian members of the Garda analysis service to further examine all homicide incidents between 2003 and 2017.  Under this review, priority has been given to the 41 cases from 2013 to 2015 that were the subject of discussion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the CSO and the Policing Authority.  To progress this review, a senior investigating officer has been appointed and an incident room has been established.  The review team&rsquo;s terms of references have been previously outlined to the committee and they effectively have two bodies of work.  These are to review the classification of each homicide incident in line with the crime counting rules and PULSE data quality, and the review of the standard of investigations carried out, particularly to ensure compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p> <p>  Each of the 41 cases is being subjected to a stringent and robust thematic review looking at a range of issues, including initial response, post mortem, main lines of inquiry, exhibits, charge process and family liaison.  To date, 12 of the 41 cases have been reviewed and two of the 41 cases are before the courts with trial dates set.  Certain commonalities have been identified in the cases reviewed to date, such as the revisiting and upgrading of investigative actions and crime classification on PULSE, which had been overlooked.  The review team has also consulted with a number of external bodies to ensure independent data quality.  These include the Office of the State Pathologist, the Courts Service and coroners' inquests.  As a result of findings to date, the review team has made a number of recommendations for changes to PULSE.<\/p> <p>  Due to the volume of work involved in the in-depth review of the 41 cases, unfortunately it will not be possible to have the work completed by the end of April 2018 as previously outlined.  The review team is committed to completing its work as quickly as possible, while very conscious of the need for each individual incident to be thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed.  We will keep all stakeholders advised on progress on these issues.<\/p> <p>  The Garda ICT department has successfully delivered a number of major projects, such as the TETRA radio communications network, e-vetting, and an automated number plate recognition system to assist the delivery of policing and security services.  This would not have been possible without a comprehensive approach to governance and project management.  In relation to ICT procurement, our focus has always been on procuring IT services that support policing and national security activity in a cost-effective manner.  In line with other public sector bodies, the annual Garda ICT budget is approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  In addition, it is subject to review by the ICT governance board, which is chaired by myself as chief administrative officer, and includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ICT governance board meets on a quarterly basis. <\/p> <p>  When talking about ICT investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is important to put this in context.  Due to the economic downturn and the subsequent decision of successive Governments to reduce funding to the Garda organisation and put in place an embargo on civilian recruitment, the ICT budget was reduced significantly.  Capital expenditure reduced by 50% and operational expenditure reduced by 43%.  In addition, the number of people employed in ICT is significantly lower than in similarly sized public sector organisations across the public service at large.  As a result, in order to maintain critical policing and national security ICT systems on a 24-seven, 365 days a year basis, it was vital that the ICT department had access to external skilled resources.  By their nature, given the range of ICT services to be provided and supported, contracts with suppliers can be very complex.  The skilled resource contract with a company we have referenced previously, namely, Accenture, commenced in 2009.  Initially, it ran for two years with the option to extend for a further two years, which it was.  The contract was further extended since 2013 to ensure the continued operation of ICT services and because the complex nature of the contract meant retendering would be difficult due to the lack of a permanent resource to design and run a procurement competition.  However, over the duration of the contract, the average cost per resource has decreased by 8%.<\/p> <p>  The report by the Garda internal audit service raised a number of issues, which have been addressed or are in the process of being addressed.  As of 1 September 2017, all Accenture staff working under the skilled resource contract are subject to the Garda electronic time recording system.  In December 2017, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the Office of Government Procurement to tender for a new skilled resource contract through open competition.  This contract has been broken into four tenders for different services, namely, service desk provision, IT operations, security and support for the strategic transformation office.  These tenders are at different stages of the procurement process.  Over the past 12 months, the number of in-house skilled resources in ICT has increased, and it will increase further in the coming years.  Increased numbers and skills, combined with new structures in the ICT department, will reduce the level of dependency on external contractors.  On the matter of agreed rates, all rates are contained in the master services agreement and annual project documents.  There are no verbally agreed rates.  In addition, the internal audit service raised the issue of pre-payments.  The decision to apply prepayments is in line with the overall Garda budgeting process and has resulted in a 5.5% discount.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the use of email service in the organisation, as was raised by the Policing Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided a report to it.  Following the issue being raised at this committee in early December 2017, this report was provided to the committee later that month.<\/p><p>It is important to state that this report related to organisational use of email and not email use by any individual within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the issue of ICT security very seriously and operates a robust and secure e-mail service.  Every year, there are approximately 48 million emails sent and received securely on our internal systems.  It was the case, however, that in order to use certain mobile devices provided to personnel, there was a requirement to sign up to an account from a commercial provider to gain security updates for the phone.  It is a standard process operated by the telecommunications industry.  There was not, though, any obligation to use the email account.  Restrictions on the sending of large files over the Garda email system also led to some people, for operational reasons, occasionally using commercial email services.<\/p><p> It is clear that our usage policies relating to email had not kept pace with technological developments.  We have taken a number of steps to address this issue.  Users cannot auto-forward emails from Garda email accounts to commercial email accounts.  Garda desktop users cannot access external email systems.  An updated policy on Internet and email usage is being finalised.  The introduction of a new enterprise content management system will enable the remote access of files from mobile devices via secure access protocols, reducing the requirement to send files via email.  Our mobility project, which is being piloted in Limerick, will securely provide mobile users with access to a range of Garda systems and information.<\/p><p> On the committee's report on Garda oversight and accountability aspects that are under our control, we have implemented a number of measures.  In the context of reducing service level complaints to GSOC, pilots have been run in the Carlow-Kilkenny division to reduce the level of such complaints and in the Pearse Street division to examine ways to resolve such complaints without formal recourse to a GSOC process.  Both pilots have proven successful.  In this regard, Ms Justice Ring has cited the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot as an example of how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC can work together to improve public confidence in policing.  It is intended to extend the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot to all divisions in the south-east region by the end of quarter 2 of 2018 and the Pearse Street pilot to other divisions by quarter 3.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has improved the process for Garda personnel speaking up about issues in the organisation.  We continue to encourage and support anyone who wishes to speak up in the future.  To strengthen our approach in this area, we are currently reviewing our protected disclosures policy in conjunction with our colleagues from the PSNI, and additional protected disclosure managers were appointed by the Commissioner in December 2017.  There are now four protected disclosure managers in the organisation, with a mix of Garda and civilian personnel, male and female, to include staff outside HR to ensure any staff seeking to bring a protected disclosure have a number of managers available to them.  In addition, we are working with Transparency Ireland in respect of training and assistance to protected disclosure managers and the policy holder.  Transparency Ireland is also assisting with the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's existing practices.

We had a PULSE upgrade in October 2015 which addressed some of those matters in advance of the new management investigation system coming on stream later this year whereby members' investigative actions can be recorded on PULSE.  Even though PULSE probably was not set up to record data like that, it does so now and has increased that.  For example, regarding those commonalities, we would have made a recommendation, which has already gone to the college, that people on senior investigating officer courses would be told of the importance of updating actions and the classification of a particular crime as they go along through the investigation.

What I can speak to is the report Mr. Kelly presented in which he comments critically on the procurement process around a range of areas.  There are projects across a variety of aspects of ICT roles and, as part of our processes, most of those contracts have been the subject of public procurement.  There are four broad areas in which public procurement issues have surfaced.  Mr. Kidd, who is the executive director of ICT, can talk to those, and they are in various stages of procurement as they currently stand.<br\/><br\/>It is important to reference the broader governance role around ICT.  Projects are managed at an individual project board level.  The role of the ICT governance board is more strategic in its nature.  I take the point the Deputy is making about the terms of reference but they tend to be at the broader strategic level.

The big one that we currently have to tender for - it is currently being prepared and some of it is out in the market - is the ICT skilled resources example.  That was mainly highlighted in the audit report.  Owing to its size and the lack of people in my organisation, I took the tender back to my office approximately 18 months ago, and I ran a mini-tender through my office to get a procurement person or company to assist the preparation of the new tenders and get the tender to the market.  That company was hired 18 months ago.  My team and I have come up with four tenders out of that complex original skilled resources tender.  One will be for the ICT help desk and it has gone to the Office of Government Procurement in order to go to the market.

We accept that this is not ideal.  We have specifically had conversations with the audit committee and with Mr. Kelly to ensure that conflicts do not arise.  That approach is the best we can do at present.  The legislation requires that Commissioner's nominee must be at deputy commissioner level or equivalent, and that leaves us as it presently stands between one of two of us.

Mr. Nugent was, at the least, economical with the answer.<\/p> <p>  I wish to echo the points that the Chairman made at the outset.  I apologise, though, as I will not be as polite as him.  The absence of the acting Commissioner and deputy commissioner has been noted by the committee.  I do not know when the acting Commissioner decided to go abroad.  Had it been organised for some time, I do not know why that could not have been communicated to the committee secretariat then.  I do not know if it is traditional for deputy commissioners to attend the type of ceremony that is supposedly under way this morning in Templemore.  It is an early time for a ceremony.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, I assume that Mr. Nugent is saying that deputy commissioners always go and that Mr. Twomey was in the book for that.  There are other deputy commissioners and I do not know why they are not present either, but this will not happen again.  There is no point in us listening to an opening statement from the acting Commissioner when information it contains is subsequently challenged by evidence given to the committee and he does not appear to answer questions on it.

I do not have that documentation but my understanding is that a business case on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na said that the number of ICT staff had fallen by almost 40% since 2008.  I think the figure was 37%.  We are talking about skilled ICT staff.  I am not quoting verbatim because I do not have the document but according to some of the language in that document, this presented a very serious threat to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to deal with serious crime and manage security.  How serious a threat is the lack of ICT staff?  I understand that the recruitment embargo impacted upon this fairly significantly.

The risk has been mitigated to a very significant degree by that use of resources but we recognise that this is not the way we want to run the operation and that the mix as it stands is too heavily leveraged towards the contracted resources.  For that reason, it is a source of some frustration that the process of getting approval for ICT staff has been quite cumbersome.  There are complexities.  In providing competitions for positions in ICT, we must provide for a mixed competition between Garda members and civilian members.  The regularisation of the terms and conditions of appointment from that have resulted in a significant delay around that issue.

The document referenced, which was reported by RT&Eacute; recently, on Sunday, 22 April, came from the office of the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, and it was to the finance and resources section of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The witnesses were not aware of the particular document, as they indicated to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  That is the specific document referenced.  It talks about 37% of the in-house IT specialists having been lost over recent years, making a case for a serious situation that continues.<\/p> <p>  In their remarks to us, in their opening statement, the witnesses referenced the same issue but stated that in the last 12 months, the number of in-house skilled resources in ICT - I presume resources means personnel - has increased and will increase, as we would all hope, over the coming years, and that consequently there will be less dependency on Accenture and other outside IT agencies.  The case put by the acting Garda Commissioner's office to the Department of Justice and Equality, with no disrespect to what the witnesses have said to us, reflects more accurately a very difficult situation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The point I am making is that we will be addressing a whole compendium of issues directly to the Minister over the next short period which we have requested.  Rather than seeing this as them and us, we want to be in complement to each other for the key issues where there is a need.  We can reflect on this with the Minister and the Department, who will be coming before us, with a supportive position for the case that has been made.  It is important that we are seen in that light.

My instruction was to downsize and to reduce cost because funding was not available.  At the time, in 2008, there were two chief superintendents, two principal officers and approximately eight assistant principal officers or superintendents - those are the equivalents - at the leadership level.  At the time of publication of the comprehensive review of the staffing needs for ICT, we had one principal officer, two superintendents and two assistant principal officers.  Compared to other big organisations, such as Revenue, while I do not want to pick Revenue out, I have a colleague there and am aware that it has nine principal officers and between 20 and 23 assistant principal officers.<\/p> <p>  Our comprehensive review saw a need for five principal officer or Garda equivalents and 14 assistant principal officers or Garda equivalents.  I am talking to Mr. Nugent about building that.  Since the approval of that document, we have been pushing through the process with the Department of Justice and Equality and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get sanction.  An agreement on sanction came through with regard to principal officers and assistant principal officers.  We are now starting the process of recruiting those people.  There are three principal officers, so two additional officers have arrived in the last year, and we got four additional assistant principal officers in the last year.  That is what Mr. Nugent and the Commissioner are referencing in that we are starting to address the leadership element.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Accenture and consultancy, I look within ICT, where we always had a dependency on pushing it down to the lowest level.

The purpose of today's meeting of the select committee is to consider the Revised Estimates for 2018 for the Department of Rural and Community  Development, amounting to &euro;216.001 million.  Vote 42 - Rural and Community Development amounts in the current year provision to &euro;208.301 million, and by way of capital supply, unspent provisions, to &euro;7.7 million.  There are total funds of &euro;216.001 million for the expenses of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, including certain services and for the payment of grants.<\/p> <p>  Today's select committee meeting is to examine the Revised Estimates 2018.  This is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates is intended to assist the committee in focusing on what the Department is committed to achieving in respect of outputs and outcomes.  I refer to considering whether the performance targets included in the Estimates are a sufficiently complete description of the services provided by the Department and whether those targets strike the right balance in terms of the needs of society.  I also refer to considering whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether these allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I propose to use the briefing prepared by the committee staff, and previously circulated to the committee, to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimate 2018.

At the outset of the consideration of each programme, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to give a high level overview of the programme, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance and related expenditure in respect of each programme in 2018.  If having discussed the subhead within a programme detailed in the secretariat briefing and members then wish to raise issues relating to a subhead not covered in the briefing, they may do so before we move on to the next programme.

I welcome the new committee members and thank previous members for their contribution in the past.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased, despite some delays, to be able to attend the committee today to discuss the Revised Estimate for the Department for 2018.  The Estimate for this year provides for an overall spend of &euro;231 million plus a capital carryover of &euro;7.7 million.  This funding is spread across a range of programmes dealing with rural development and community development, as well as funding for the Charities Regulator.  The context for this funding is especially important.  Ireland stands at an important point in its development.  We have emerged from a devastating recession, during which unemployment escalated and the quality of life of all of our citizens was diminished.  Having corrected the national economy we have an opportunity to create a long-term and sustainable future for our people, not just in economic terms but in social and cultural terms also.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan and the national planning framework provide the overarching framework for Government policy and investment over the next decade and up to 2040.  These documents set out an ambition for Ireland in 2040, an Ireland where we expect an extra 1 million people will have been added to our population and an additional 660,000 people will be at work.<\/p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 sets a bold vision for national development and identifies ten strategic outcomes to which the Government is fully committed.  The plan is a good one for rural Ireland, with many of the strategic outcomes benefitting rural areas across investment programmes in sectors such as transport, energy and tourism.  The Department has a key role to play in driving progress towards the strategic outcome of strengthening rural economies and communities in the national development plan.  The investments we make through the Department's Vote will be significant in delivering on this objective and enabling and promoting the regeneration of communities the length and breadth of the country.  The announcement of the new rural regeneration and development fund in the national development plan is a tremendous boost for rural Ireland.  It is significant extra funding of &euro;1 billion over ten years, and signals a new approach and new potential for rural areas.  The basis for the Government's investment is to support and realise the full potential of rural communities throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Rural regeneration requires a co-ordinated approach to public investment, getting funding and aligning initiatives to enhance the capacity of rural areas to grow substantially.  We need to be ambitious and innovative in our use of public funding to achieve the best impact for rural communities.  The new fund will provide the means for achieving this.  I am consulting with my colleagues in Government on the establishment of the fund and hope to make announcements in this regard shortly.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious not to intrude excessively into the committee's time to examine the Department's 2018 Estimate, and I would like to allow some time for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to speak, so I will briefly highlight key points on the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate before the select committee sets out the Department's budget for 2018.  Gross expenditure of &euro;231.532 million is budgeted for the Department this year.  This represents an increase of 42% on the provisions in 2017.  Part of the increase is due to the transfer to the Department of the community services programme, which was formerly under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Department's current expenditure provision for 2018 is &euro;144.024 million.  The capital provision for 2017 is &euro;87.508 million.  In addition, provision has also been made for the capital carryover of &euro;7.7 million for 2017, which will supplement the provision in the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate is broken down into three programme areas.  These are rural development and regional affairs, community development and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  The total provision for the rural development and regional affairs programme is &euro;93.384 million.  The purpose of the programme is to promote and make long-term sustainable economic and social progress in rural Ireland.  Key actions include the implementation of the Leader programme, with the investment of &euro;35 million and an additional capital carryover of &euro;5 million; the delivery of a range of rural development schemes, including the rural recreation scheme and CL&Aacute;R, for which almost &euro;19 million has been allocated plus carryover of &euro;2.7 million capital; the town and village renewal scheme, which has an allocation of &euro;15 million for this year; and the local improvement scheme, which has been allocated &euro;10 million.<\/p> <p>  I wrote to the local authorities earlier this year setting out a schedule for the launch of these schemes and community development programmes to allow the local authorities and communities to plan their projects more effectively.  I began launching the schemes much earlier than was the case in the past two years, commencing with the launch of the local improvement scheme in February.  I also launched the CL&Aacute;R programme in March.  The town and village renewal scheme and the rural recreation scheme will be announced shortly.<\/p> <p>  The Department's 2018 Vote provides &euro;133.596 million in funding for a range of community programmes.  Two programmes in particular account for the bulk of this funding.  More than &euro;43 million is provided for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  Last week in Limerick, I launched the 2018 to 2022 programme.  The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  The 2018 allocation will provide for the first year of a new five year programme of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities.  This will allow for the key essential front-line services delivered through earlier programmes to be maintained and further developed.<\/p> <p>  The second major programme is the community services programme, with an allocation of more than &euro;46 million.  This programme provides for financial support to community organisations to deliver services through a social enterprise model.<\/p><p>In February I announced a total of &euro;815,000 in additional funding for 12 social enterprises under strand 3 of the programme.  I expect to be in a position to announce further funding allocations later in the year.<\/p><p> The community development programme provision also funds local community development committees, LCDCs, and public participation networks.  The development of these structures is strategically very important to ensure local voices influence planning and investment decisions at local level.  For example, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is managed and implemented though the LCDCs in each local authority area.  They provide the local knowledge to make sure the SICAP is implemented in ways that address the key issues in local areas.<\/p><p> This is a time of exciting opportunity for the country and I know that members will share my view that, regardless of where people live in Ireland, they should have an opportunity and better choices.  There are many excellent initiatives happening in rural Ireland and communities.  My Department's role is to help to build on these excellent examples of community involvement, job creation and social cohesion.  The Government is committed to ensuring its policies recognise the unique challenges sometimes faced by communities.  Our future investment choices must take account of these challenges.  I am also particularly mindful of the need to ensure funds voted by the Oireachtas are put to use for the purposes for which they are voted.  To that end, I have taken a number of steps to maximise the efficiency of our investment, including direct engagement with city and county managers to ensure more effective and efficient use of funding provided for them.  I know that members will share my desire to improve the lives of people who live in rural Ireland and build strong communities, be they in urban or rural areas.  I look forward to engaging with members in that regard.  <\/p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible to allow for a full discussion on the programmes in place and the funding to be provided by my Department this year.  I am happy to deal with questions members may have.  Perhaps the committee might allow the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, to say a few words on his area, including the Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#B01100","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the select committee.  I am pleased to be able to join the committee in considering the Revised Estimates for 2018 for the Department.  As the Minister has done, I emphasise the importance of the current context and the urgent need for Ireland to put in place on a sustainable basis plans for long-term national development.  I welcome the national development plan and the national planning framework and look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the objectives set out in the plans.<\/p> <p>  During my appearance at the committee last November I set out my responsibilities as including oversight of the works of the Western Development Commission; functions related to the Department's input on rural broadband under the national planning framework; an overview of a number of funding schemes under the community programme; responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority, excluding the appointment of members of the board; and the Control of Dogs Act.  I also have responsibility for the Atlantic economic corridor task force.  In that regard, I am sure the committee will welcome the inclusion of the corridor in the national development plan and the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  On broadband, members will be aware that our goal in the national broadband plan is to achieve 100% coverage of high-speed broadband across Ireland.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is working to progress this objective.  My Department is working with local authorities to ensure there are no local barriers to deployment and identify priority areas for roll-out.  A provision of &euro;2 million has been allocated from the Department for this task in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The Department also has lead responsibility for developing the relationship within the State with the community and voluntary sector and setting the policy framework.  This sector has &euro;12.7 million budgeted for in 2018.  The Department's community and voluntary support programmes provide a cohesive framework of support for the community and voluntary sector by giving support to volunteer centres and volunteer information services nationwide, as well as a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and Young Social Innovators.  The funding for all of these organisations is designed to strengthen and foster voluntarism in Ireland, building strong support for volunteering locally from the bottom up.  That is key to the Department's citizen engagement objectives and supports the spirit of participation within communities.  The scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, SSNO, is a key element of the State's support for the role of the sector.  The SSNO provides multi-annual funding towards the core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide support for those who are disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates provide for an allocation of just over &euro;4.4 million in current funding in 2018 for the Charities Regulatory Authority.  The charities regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  It is an independent authority that was established on 16 October 2014 under the Charities Act 2009 and that now comes within the remit of the Department.  The general function of the regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland so as to increase public trust and confidence in the management and administration of charities.  The regulator is independent in the performance of its statutory functions.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to be working with the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, in the new Department.  I am very conscious of the critical role the Department must play in supporting Ireland's overall national development, especially rural and community development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#C00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":997,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.

There is a carryover of another &euro;5 million, giving a total of &euro;35 million, of which &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million will go to the cost of administration of th programme.  How this is done is one mystery I have yet to solve.  It is considered to be capital expenditure, but it is actually to meet the cost of administration.  That leaves an allocation of about &euro;23 million for this year.  It concerns me that, give or take a few hundred thousand euro, there is a total of &euro;23 million because I understand that at the beginning of the year the Department spent &euro;1.5 million.  It is even more concerning that in the months from February to April total expenditure on projects was &euro;500,000.  I am not blaming the Minister for this because it is up to the companies involved, all of which I understand have been set up.  Only one - Galway East which I presume is up and running - had not been approved tjo receive even &euro;1.  The rest seem to have been approved.  The figure for approvals has gone from &euro;20 million to &euro;29 million.  However, one third of the year has passed and I suspect very strongly that the figure of this year will go nowhere near &euro;23 million.  That is why I asked the Chairman a serious question.  He remembered this cycle last year.  <\/p> <p>  Rather than leave it until after the holidays, sometime between now and the end of June the Minister might have to make a genuine call or what we used to call the cash call.  If the money is not going to be spent to meet demand under the Leader programme, it could be spent more usefully on other things.  When I look at the accurate expenditure figure for LEADER - According to the reply I received to a parliamentary question on 17 April, at the end of March the accurate figure for expenditure under the Leader programme was &euro;2.6 million.<\/p><p>Is the Minister already planning?  In his heart and soul, the Minister might recognise this as not being far off the mark.  It is very likely that if he does not do anything, he will wind up with not all of this being spent.  As the Minister knows, except for local improvement schemes, LIS, the spending of money is slow.  If one waits until September to start checking the money, one will not get out of the door by the end of December.  There always seems to be a concern in the Department that it might bust a bolt in capital expenditure.  That can happen in current expenditure and has to be avoided at all costs.  It is much harder in capital.  Normally, in December, one is actually scrambling around looking for bills to pay but in the event that one arrives on 1 December with all one's bills paid, everything up to date but with the Department out of money, any bill that comes in in December does not have to be paid until January if one so chooses, because there is a 30-day pay period.  There is a great cushion there, as the Minister knows, and there are other devices to shelter the Minister.  What is the Minister's prognosis for the spend on Leader?  Does he really believe he is going to spend &euro;23 million, that is, spending &euro;22 million between now and the end of the year, at the end of November and beginning of December, because the Minister has virtually spent none?  If he is not going to spend it, when is he going to start shifting the money or at least making contingency plans to shift the money and getting other programmes that the money could be spent on?  I have many good ideas for the Minister but we would want some lead-in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#C00600","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>The questions Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked are the questions I would ask about Leader.

The bottom line is that as I meet those involved in numerous projects in west Cork over the past couple of years and throughout the country, others are desperately seeking this funding and it is not filtering down to the community.  The only money that I heard of was when somebody told me that our local Fine Gael Deputy had on posted his Facebook page that he was able to get money for a group.  I thought that was the great thing about being on the Leader board, that we never announced who got money.  The Leader company announced who got money.  Now it looks as if the politician will announce that he has got the news from the Minister or such.

The Deputy has raised an issue with the programme itself previously.  We made changes to the schemes.  The other figures I want to give are on the amount of schemes that have been approved, the value of them and what is coming down the line.  Up to the end of the year, we had 900 schemes approved, to the value of &euro;26,292,771 and we have 285 now waiting to be approved, to the value of &euro;16.165 million.  The Deputy was involved in the Leader programme and knows that it takes a while for schemes to ramp up.  When we make the allocations, if it is a community hall or another building, the money has to be spent before it can be drawn back down.  I want to see the money spent.  The Deputy asked a straight question and I will give a straight answer.  He is correct that I will monitor this very closely.  I will be monitoring earlier this year and I will not allow what happened last year to happen.  I give the Deputy a commitment that I will monitor this into June and it certainly will not pass July, and then I will have to start making decisions with regard to going to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see where I can reallocate some of that money.<\/p> <p>  Last year, I looked at capital funding, and the Deputy is correct about it.  It is difficult to get schemes that can draw down the funding this year.  Last year, I brought in the shows, and gave some funding to them, Tidy Towns and the libraries.  I looked at ways in which the capital funding could be spent by the end of the year.  With regard to Leader itself, I will give a simple example.  I will not use the Deputy's constituency but another constituency, Kerry, which has 119 approvals.  If one goes to other counties, there are numbers such as 23, 50, 20, and 15.  The programmes are up and running.  I would hope that we would see more allocations, more groups coming in and more of that funding being drawn down.  As I say, we have the money and we want to spend the money.  There is no doubt but that since January, one can see the spend profile is increasing month to month and we expected that to happen.  On the Deputy's question, I will have to monitor that between now and June and July.  I will be making proposals and have to talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#D00800","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>According to the Minister's figures - not mine - on 15 April, total project payments under the Leader programme were &euro;1.5 million.

The Chairman asked a question about clearing roadblocks and so on but the Minister made a valid point in reply.  If there was &euro;50 million approved by September or October, which would be a ramp-up to double where we are at present, the reality is that at that stage, it would be up to the people who get the money to spend it, make the claim and do everything right.

I presume it would be a help to the Minister if he did away with some of the over-regulation and the over-checking regarding sums that amount to peanuts and tried to focus more on making money available on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#F00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I will respond first to Deputy Martin Kenny, who was speaking in the D&aacute;il when I gave the figures.

In relation to the town and village scheme, I have to take some of the blame myself, to be fair, on the basis that I did not get it out in time last year.

The Department has carried out a limited number of actions under CL&Aacute;R, which I welcome.  It is time now, however, to start to widen its scope.  It has fantastic potential.  In that regard, I mention two ideas which I know are feasible.  The first is a good scheme because it leverages money.  I refer to the group water scheme top-up grant.  The number of houses which are not on a good and properly regulated group water scheme or on a mains scheme is small.  However, these houses do exist in clusters which are dependent on wells of variable quality.  There was huge demand for the top-up scheme before and we were getting close to dealing with this.  A lot of schemes were nearly ready to go.  This is a slow burner because, no more than anything else, it will not break the bank this year.  If the Minister approved the money this year, it would not be spent until next year.  Will the Minister consider re-instituting that scheme this year to achieve a target of giving everybody in the country, within reason, access to running water at a reasonable cost from either a group scheme or a mains supply?  There are not many houses which are five miles away from any other house but I would accept that such houses might not be included.  The top-up scheme proved very effective at delivering that in the past.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, the Minister of State and the Chairman will all agree about the following.  We have fought for many years to do something on the western rail corridor.  Part of the corridor between Athenry to Claremorris is in the CL&Aacute;R area.  In the context of leveraging funds, I note that nothing galvanises State agencies to take action like throwing a few bob on the table to match their funding.  I understand the cost of doing the route from Athenry to Claremorris is approximately &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million, which is small beer in the context of the billions spent on roads, the Luas and the metro.  Will the Minister consider throwing a few bob on the table under CL&Aacute;R and rural development to put it up to those agencies?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland might meet the Minister about \"The Quiet Man\" station.  We could put historic trains on there to bring tourists down to re-enact John Wayne's role.<\/p> <p>  This would provide a commuter line to Galway also.  The Minister represents Mayo while the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and I represent Galway.  Can the Minister imagine if the train were not to stop at Manulla but continued on to Claremorris, Athenry and Galway to pick up people coming from Westport and Castlebar who wanted to go to Galway?  They could be picked up in either Manulla or Claremorris.  It would mean a proper integrated service in the west, in particular a commuter service into Galway which is going to have 40,000 to 50,000 extra people living there in the next 20 years.  I have often pointed out that the Harcourt Street line closed in 1959 and was sold.  Everybody said there was no population in Dundrum or Cherrywood and it would never be viable.  Within ten years or 20 years at the very outside, which was 1979, there was massive regret that it had been sold.  By 1989, the regret was so great, they had to go back and buy everything again at enormous cost to put back the railway line.<\/p> <p>  The Minister can make this happen.  He has the will, the way and the money.  It would be a strategic project for which he would be forever remembered.  If we had a proper commuter service coming into Galway, which is to say arriving and leaving at the right times, I am convinced we would get very good patronage on the line.  Athenry to Galway has already proved that.  There would also be freight trains from Ballina to Foynes, Cork and Waterford without having to travel along all the railway lines on the east coast.  Those are two ideas for the Minister today and I would like to hear a response.  It is time the Minister with responsibility for rural development showed us something.  He is a year in the senior job.  I accept that he is in a much better position on issues like this now.  Will he at least consider what I say?  I have discussed matters with Bord F&aacute;ilte previously and have no doubt that if the Minister did a bit, it would do a bit too.  It would then be very hard for the big boys in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to say no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#G00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>There are two good ideas here.  I am giving serious consideration to one in circumstances where I have deputations every day on group water schemes.  The Deputy is quite correct that a lot of these schemes were ready to go before the crash which did not then go ahead.  On costs and the local contributions, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v brought that scheme in a number of years ago.  As such, there are a number of group water schemes which would not have been developed but for it.  I have to look at water schemes and I have to look at small group sewerage schemes also.  Because these schemes involve small numbers of people, the local contribution is a big one for them.<\/p><p>It is a big contribution but towns and cities do not have to make an overall contribution.  The Deputy is right to suggest that I should start considering creating a scheme now that can roll on for the next few years because it will be a slow burner.  It takes a while for group water schemes to get started.  Some schemes await funding from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but they also need a bit of help with a top-up.  The suggestion made by the Deputy is good and I will give it consideration.<\/p><p> The other scheme is bigger.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would have to consider it and start the ball rolling.  As Deputies will know, the rural regeneration scheme is coming.  My Department is having discussions with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are analysing schemes such as the Leader programme as mentioned and try to learn from them.  In terms of the western rail corridor, if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, county councils and other State agencies are prepared to provide funding then, as Minister, I would consider the project.

As he knows, if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport knew his Department was putting money on the table it would put it up to that Department to be a lead Department and not one that just says \"no\".  In my view, certainty about money would greatly encourage the Department just as European money used to act as a leverage.  One of the initial hallmarks of CL&Aacute;R was leverage.  In other words, for every &euro;5 million that was spent one hoped to leverage another &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million.  The Group R scheme is an obvious one because for every &euro;1 spent one probably receives five times that sum from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport can choose to say \"no\".  The Minister for Rural and Community Development could make an offer that if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport agreed, his Department would be willing to pay its share.  I suggest &euro;7 million a year over three years of unspent Leader funding would make a very significant input.  I have no doubt that F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be interested in promoting tourism related to the film \"The Quiet Man\".  The Ballyglunin railway station is an obvious project for the west.  Such development would enable tourists to travel by steam train, for example, to the film set and allow them to re-enact famous scenes portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne.  The project would be similar to what is available in Dunbrody, County Wexford.  The project would attract every child in the country and adults could pretend they were only going to please their children.  I definitely think the Minister could get poly-funding for the project; he is the man to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#H00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport does not have much of a record for matching the funding that I have put in place and it is not for the want of my asking.

I know some work has been done in different parts of the country.  An excellent walkway has been built around a lake in Drumshambo, Country Leitrim.  Another project in north Leitrim seeks funding to build a greenway.  A number of projects in different places await funding.  There seems to be a slowness in moving the projects forward as quickly as needed.  Can the Minister ensure these projects will be progressed as quickly as possible?<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said about the western rail corridor.  The project can act as a beacon to emphasise that rural Ireland is coming back to life.  I would like everything that can be done to be done.  As the Minister for Rural and Community Development will know, the big problem for a vast majority of rural Ireland is rural depopulation, decline and people feeling there is no future for them, which we must change.  As I have said many times, the sense of future is really what it is all about.  People want to feel that they have a stake in the place.  Very often people have discovered that what existed in the past has dwindled away.  I live in the parish of Aughavas, County Leitrim.  The local national school has started a programme to encourage new families to move to the area because only three children will start national school next year and just one the year after.  If such decline in the number of children living in the area continues then the three teacher school will close in five or ten years time. <\/p> <p>  No one is moving to the area because there is little or no employment available and, therefore, no sense of a future.  That is the big issue that we need to change.  People can live in rural areas but work 30 miles away.  That is a short commute compared with being stuck in traffic while going to work in cities.  People have a better lifestyle, etc. when they live in rural areas.  The advantages of rural Ireland will only be known to people when we start doing stuff that people can see and proves that the Government and society believe in rural Ireland again.  I accept that the Minister and his colleagues believe in having a thriving rural Ireland.  In order for rural Ireland to survive and thrive we need big flagship projects such as the development of the western rail corridor.  Such projects would provide the Government is serious about investing in rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Group water schemes were mentioned.  I wish to mention group sewerage schemes as they are very important.  In many parts of the country people live within a mile or so of local towns in close proximity and there is great pressure placed on them to have septic tanks.  If an adequate scheme was put in place to provide funding it would be a huge help to the people who live in such areas.  The current scheme is very poor and hard to access. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#H00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>To be fair, Deputy Martin Kenny attended many of launches of our projects.

Waterways Ireland built the walkway with funding of &euro;700,000 from my Department.  We continued the project into Leitrim village and on to Carrick-on-Shannon.  Another &euro;1 million has been allocated for the latest connection.  It is incredible what the project has done for the county and other examples can be found in Longford, Lubgate in Skibbereen, County Cork and Offaly.  Small amounts of funding reap great benefits through, for example, the town and village regeneration programme, the CL&Aacute;R programme and rural recreation programme.<\/p><p>I happened to be in Achill when I was at home at the weekend.  Funding has been received to extend the greenway into Achill.  Businesses all over the country have been lifted.  There is no doubt that the effects of the schemes we have introduced over the past two years are now beginning to be seen.  It is possible to see what has been built and what is in action under these schemes, just as it is under the Leader programme.  Projects like the food hub in Drumshanbo, which was mentioned by Deputy Kenny, are creating jobs and adding to confidence in the environment.<\/p><p> Some communities are great at getting funding under various schemes, including CL&Aacute;R, the town and village scheme and the rural environment programme.  We have to think about the villages as well as the towns.  Small funding gives a big lift to villages.  Bigger amounts of money give a lift to cities and towns.  We have to make sure there is an even spread.  We try to look after the smaller places.  I am pleased with the schemes we have introduced and the jobs that have been created.  I am pleased with the goodwill that exists now.  At last, communities feel that the Government is beginning to give them a bit of support.  The introduction of certain schemes is a sign that the Government is listening to them.  We hope that when the rural regeneration scheme is announced, we will be able to announce a few flagship projects that people will come in and tender for.  We hope the scheme will be announced in July.  All of my schemes will be up and running then.  As I have said, the CL&Aacute;R programme is already up and running and will be closing next week.  The local improvement scheme has been done.  The town and village scheme will be opened on Friday.  The rural recreation scheme will be open shortly.<\/p><p> I am happy with the schemes and with the funding we have allocated and spread throughout the country.  I am happy that jobs are being created.  I want to see money being spent.  It gives me great pleasure and it is a source of great job satisfaction to see a new vibrancy in rural communities that have not had much confidence for a while.  While it is good that people are becoming aware that grant aid can be drawn down to avail of the opportunities that exist, it is not all about grant aid - it is also about people being committed to the projects in which they are involved.  I have seen what people in fine communities throughout the country have done after receiving small amounts of funding from the State.  In some cases, those people have raised their own funds or borrowed money.  Their projects are up and running.  Some of the people in question have availed of the social inclusion and community activation programme, the community activation programme, the town and village scheme or the rural recreation scheme.  I am pleased to have seen this in County Leitrim.  When there is a return on the funding that is spent, it gives people a bit of hope.  That is what it is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#H00700","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>All of that is excellent and needs to happen, but the point I am making relates to a difficulty we have with tourism projects that make a significant difference in many places.  Someone said to me recently that a lot of this stuff is for the benefit of people who make their money somewhere else and come to spend it in our local areas.  We need stuff that allows people to make their money in our local areas.  There needs to be a productive economy in rural Ireland.  It should not just be a recreational economy.  That is one of the things that have been missing.  The Minister mentioned the food hub in Drumshanbo, which is an absolutely excellent project that has made a huge difference to the town.  Almost 100 people are working in the hub at the moment.  We need more of that.  A man told me last week that he had been speaking to a food company in the Far East that supplies major hotels in that part of the world.  The company in question is unable to get enough of artisan Irish food like cheese that has a story to it.  The food hub in Drumshanbo is producing the kind of niche products that we need to try to bring into the mainstream to a certain extent.  Such initiatives can bring life back into rural Ireland.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has an opportunity to start to work on this.  One of the problems we have had with successive Governments - I am not blaming the current Government, in particular - is that every Department and every part of the Civil Service seeks to push things along to be done somewhere else.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development has an opportunity to be the person who does not push this issue somewhere else.  He should pull it all in and say we want this to happen in rural Ireland.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, we want to leverage money from somewhere else.  If we are to make that happen, the Department of Rural and Community Development will have to put up the first challenge to everywhere else to come on board with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

We hope community groups, State agencies, chambers of commerce and people will come together if they feel they have a scheme that is worthy of being funded under this plan.  That is what we are looking for now.  As I have said, the rural regeneration scheme will be up and running in July.  We hope to make the allocations sometime before the end of the year.  There will be a drawdown from that scheme early next year.  I am confident that what we are proposing will try to address some of the depopulation we have all over the country.

When I was in Boston recently, I was told it is the most modern city in the world.  It has big problems such as unemployment and traffic congestion, just like Dublin does.  When one travels a mile outside Boston, there is no broadband.  The mayor told me that it is a big issue.  It is a big issue all over the world.  Up to 71% of rural Ireland is now going to have broadband.  A scheme that is supposed to get up and running in the coming months will continue the process of getting as much of rural Ireland as possible covered by broadband.  The Deputy is quite correct when he says we need infrastructure like broadband to be rolled out.  We are trying to roll it out.  To be honest, I would have said myself that it is not happening.  I live in a place that does not have broadband.  I will have it in a month's time, not because I am there but simply because it is in the plan and covered by the map.  It annoys me that in places where I do not live, the people who came down the roads did one side of the road because it was covered by the map.  They could have done the other side of the road as well if they were allowed to do so, but they were not.  At least it is happening.  I see it on the ground every single day.  People have been connected to broadband every minute we have spent talking in here.  As I have said, when I was in Boston, the biggest issue was that there is no broadband when one travels a mile outside the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00700","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I would like to ask a question about rural recreation.  I cannot let it go.  I notice that Comhairle na Tuaithe had just one meeting last year.  A report has been done on it.  It is meant to be revised, upgraded or updated.  When it was set up, the main issue was access to the hills.  Two pilot projects that have been in place since 2009 or 2010 were meant to indicate whether the needs of hill walkers would be satisfied if enough hills were opened in a structured and organised way.  There is no need to open all the hills.  If 60% or 70% of hills are open, and if people knew which hills are open, car parks can be created and gates and stiles can be provided so that there is no need to go over fences.  When does the Minister think he can get the liability or insurance issue, which has been the big hold-up in this regard, put to bed?  It is only a contingency issue.  The Supreme Court has ruled again and again that there is no liability if one slips on a rock on a mountain.  The only risk to farmers in such circumstances, bearing in mind that their farming needs would be covered, is not the liability - it is the possibility of them being taken to court and having to spend lots of money defending themselves against cases that cannot be won.  Will the Minister give us some date for the finalisation of the access issue so that all the walking does not have to be concentrated on a few paths, which can lead to hills being worn down?  There needs to be wide access.  We can say \"good luck\" to those who do not want their hills to be open because that is their right.  I believe the vast majority of farming communities actually want hills to be open because they know it is a huge advantage for their families, communities, local GAA teams and all the rest.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the walks scheme, which again is in suspended animation.  Greenways are different.  When we talk about greenways, we revert to the old question of whether the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is going to try to dump this responsibility on the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  If they gave it to the Minister, and the money with it, I would be very happy.<\/p><p>If it retained control and the Minister's Department ended up handling greenways out of frustration, however, it would be unsatisfactory.  The Minister has the walks scheme.  Will he be able to extend it this year and start paying people to maintain walks?  I am not referring to greenways, which have tarmacadam, but the ones across moorland and so on.  The scheme is popular with farmers, provides a great service and is win-win all the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#J00800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I will take the easy question first, that of the walks scheme.  Actually, it is not easy, but it is one of the better schemes that the Deputy set up and it has worked well.  We have 39 trails and 1,905 farmers involved in the scheme, costing the taxpayer &euro;1.8 million per year.  I told the Deputy during our previous D&aacute;il Question Time that I was hoping to get more walks included in the scheme by the end of this year.  I am committed to doing that.  I will have to provide funding for payments in next year's budget.<\/p> <p>  As to this year's payments, I will need to consider ways and means of increasing the number of walks.  I want to do that because, although the money involved is small, it supports those farmers who have been supportive of the scheme and it has worked well.  I have made clear to my departmental officials that I do not want the scheme to be complicated in any way.  How it works should remain simple.  I need to identify and implement a process to get more walks involved.  I intend to have a number of walks selected by the end of the year and have them in payment for next year.  I will honour the commitment that I made to the D&aacute;il in that regard.  I have made clear to my officials that I want this done, and it will be done between now and the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question is more difficult.  When I held a meeting with the IFA today, that scheme was one of the issues raised.  The IFA has great concerns about it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and other Deputies have been raising it with me for a long time.  The Department is considering ways and means.  The Deputy is aware that the previous Department I happened to be in dealt with a court case involving the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and something that occurred on a mountain.  It is wonderful that the State won the case on appeal.  Otherwise, it would have had serious consequences for walks, trails, etc.<\/p> <p>  We need to consider this scheme.  Alongside my legal advisers, officials in my Department are working to determine whether anything can be done with it.  The Deputy was correct in how he outlined the situation.  If landowners or farmers are allowing people onto their land, why should they have to hire solicitors and barristers if a case goes to court, possibly even the High Court?  The State will have to play its part.  We are considering this matter and I am waiting on that advice.

Perhaps the Minister could engage in a consultation process with the public and community groups on how to broaden CL&Aacute;R, group sewerage schemes and group water schemes.  For example, someone contacted me this week who had an issue with crossing cattle over a road.  The road is not a new development, so he is not eligible for funding.

The Minister has &euro;1 million for broadband.  While broadband is not within his Department's remit, it and roads are the greatest issues in rural Ireland.  Some people are getting broadband while others are not.  What has been done by Eir is fantastic.  For those who have it, 1 Gbps makes them internationally competitive.  I met a manufacturer after he had acquired 1 Gbps broadband.  When he told me that there was only one snag, I threw my eyes to heaven and wondered what it was now, but his only problem was that his customers on the much more populated island across the water could not match what he had.  I asked him was it not a great thing to be able to say that, at the back of the mountain, he had 1 Gbps and they were relying on a lot less.<\/p> <p>  Where this broadband is provided, it is fantastic, but it is driving the 30% of people who are half a mile, 1 mile, 3 miles, 5 miles or 8 miles away mad.  Will the Minister give me a small guarantee today, namely, that we will adopt without messing the same policy to broadband that we adopted to electricity and telephones when they were introduced and that, unlike what happened with water, it will be provided to every house and business in the country?  Fibre is cheaper to roll out than copper.  Let us go for bust and be the first country in the world that decides that every house without exception must be connected to fibre.<\/p> <p>  There is a misunderstanding.  The Minister knows Keel on Achill Island much better than I do.  When the Web Summit came to Ireland, those high worth individuals stayed in Keel for the weekend to get the cobwebs out of their heads after all of the hard business in Dublin.  They did all sorts of mad things like kite sailing on the worst October day.  When high net worth individuals like that and who are into extreme sports go away, a place like Achill is ideal in the sense that it has cliffs, wild seas, surfing, kite surfing, cycling around the island, which these ones did, and so on.<\/p><p>They want the really rugged, hard stuff, but they also want one other thing in those very isolated but very attractive places and that is world-class broadband.  They will stay the extra few days if they have New York broadband at the back of the mountain in Keel.  If it is not there, they will get the hell out as fast as they can.  While broadband is of paramount importance for local people, it is also paramount to attract the high net worth individuals who need constant contact to these places.  They tend to gravitate to west Sligo, to the Achill's of this world.  There are so many good reasons to connect every house, and the more isolated it is, the more important that is, both to the local and to the visitor.  Will the Minister promise that he will make sure that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, will connect every house?  I hope there will be no talk of reaching 90% because 90% of the country leaves out 30% of those who live in rural Ireland because there are so many people in the cities.

We are still in a competitive process and expect contracts to be signed this autumn to allow that to be rolled out.  I fully accept what the Deputy has said about Achill Island.  I am sure he has seen the wonderful plan produced by the community in Achill recently, through Mayo County Council.

They would both be familiar with the small towns in the west with populations of a few hundred people.  Williamstown and Glenamaddy would be examples of what I mean by a small town.  Could we bring in a new initiative under the Tidy Towns competition so that those who paint the front of their houses, for example, could claim back the VAT?  I know it cannot be taken off at the beginning under EU rules but we should give some incentive to people.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, he has promoted the living over the shop initiative, trying to get people into small towns.  However, that has not progressed.  When  one phones local authorities, one finds that it is sitting there, as it were, and there is no direction.  We are left in a quagmire.  If we are serious about revitalising rural Ireland, we need to make sure that we give incentives.  Perhaps the Minister for Rural and Community Development could speak to the Minister for Finance about the possibility of introducing tax incentives, particularly in the context of the current housing problem, to encourage people to come back to live in small towns, thus revitalising them.  Incentives may help with that.  Generally when the middle sized towns are competing with the smaller ones for the same money, there can be a bit of a problem.  Is there anything that we could do for towns with fewer than 500 people in them?  I am talking about small villages really.  Is there anything that the Department could do to kick-start such villages, perhaps through the Tidy Towns structure?  Could something be given to those who do up the shopfront or the house front to give it a lift?  A lot of the smaller tidy towns committees are doing Trojan work but they are battling with the bigger towns.  I do not want to cause a split between different sized towns but I would ask that the Department would give the smaller ones a good leg up.  Generally when local authorities get involved in revitalisation, they pick one or two areas on which they will spend &euro;250,000.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, would be familiar with that in Galway and the municipal districts structure.  It is a good thing.  I am not saying anything against it but it is the bigger sized towns that get the money and the smaller towns and villages are struggling a bit.<\/p><p>In the context of CL&Aacute;R, some of the smaller towns and villages have built a community centre outside of the 50 km zone.  There would be applications going into the Department of Rural and Community Development to lay a footpath up to such centres over a five-year period but some of the local authorities are kicking up and insisting that footpaths must be inside the 50 km area.  Some people have been ambitious and have built a funeral home beside a community centre to incorporate different things.  There might be a school in the village but the community centre or the football pitch might be up the road and teachers have to try to get children up there safely during the day or there might be a cr<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&egrave;<\/font>che at the community centre.  I would ask the Department to have an open mind with regard to applications for funding for footpaths in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#L00600","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice has raised these issues with me previously.  Regarding the Tidy Towns competition, I cannot let this opportunity pass without complimenting everybody involved.  This year is the 60th anniversary of the Tidy Towns competition, and what that competition does for small towns and villages, as well as big towns and cities is a credit to everyone involved.  We do not thank them enough.  We sometimes hear criticism of the committees, their work and the role that they play, but I cannot praise them enough.  I have never met such dedicated people, whether they are in Roscommon, Mayo, Kerry or Cork.<\/p><p>It does not matter because they are committed to what they do, which is why at the end of last year I provided &euro;1.4 million for Tidy Towns committees around the country.  I gave them all a grant.  I distinguished between villages, towns and cities but they were all delighted with the grants they got.  It was only an expression of thanks and appreciation for the work they did.  The money went on projects for this year, which is the 60th anniversary.  I hope GAA, soccer, rugby and athletic clubs, the IFA and all communities will make a special effort this year for the Tidy Towns and clean up rural and urban Ireland for the 60th anniversary.  It is terrible that as we are doing this, there are people dumping every minute of the day.  <\/p><p> On the issue the Deputy raised, I was in east Galway recently.  The town and village scheme gave a place called Woodford &euro;70,000 to do exactly what the Deputy is talking about.  The Deputy is right.  It got &euro;70,000.  The footpaths had not been done in about 40 years.  It gave a lift to the town.  This year, the people there tell me they want to do the other side.  It has given a lift to the community.  They see progress and are delighted to see that at last there is a scheme that helps and supports them.  <\/p><p> We are looking at the other issue the Deputy raised but it is not easy.  I am being honest with the Deputy.  We are looking at a pilot scheme to encourage residents to occupy properties they have.  There are small towns where there were businesses in the past but as a result of the Internet and the way business has grown, shops are closing.  We try to encourage people to go back to live in towns and villages.  We are looking at a pilot scheme.  My officials have had lots of discussions with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are trying to bring in a pilot scheme to give people a grant to do up their properties.  The scheme is not in place yet but its purpose would be to encourage people to go back and live in villages and towns and to repopulate small villages and small towns.  We want to get that scheme running with the town and village scheme.  I reiterate it is called the town and village scheme because sometimes, we forget about the villages.  The Deputy is quite correct that the smaller areas need a small bit of support and a bit of a lift.  That is why in the last round of these projects I asked councils to concentrate on towns and villages, particularly the smaller towns as opposed to the bigger ones, to give them an opportunity to advance and get some funding from these schemes.  It has worked very well.  We probably need more funding, which is something I need to discuss with Government to try to get money for these schemes because they are working well.  I would love to see the pilot scheme up and running.  I would love to pilot it around the country to see what effect it would have on small villages and small towns.  It is something I am working on with my officials and the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Public Expenditure and Reform to try to get it over the line.  We want to put a scheme in place that will not complicate anything.  We are working on it.  I would like to see it happening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#L00700","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>On the issue of town and village renewal, there was a scheme for people who had a derelict house in a town and they could get &euro;40,000 from the council to do it up.

It seemed to miss the point.  The lesson was that some investment has to be put in.  We need a grant where we tell people we will give them a 45% or 55% grant to do up the house.  It has to be a grant of over 55% for a person to be able to borrow the rest and to be able to foresee getting the money back at some stage.  If we do that, a person will spend &euro;40,000 doing up a house.  If the person has a grant of about &euro;25,000, within three months, between VAT, excise duty and income tax returns on the workers who do the work on the house, the Government will probably get most of the grant back.  The money goes back in again and that is before ever talking about the spin-off arising from the activity in the community.  There must be an acknowledgment somewhere that we are not spending money in rural Ireland but are investing money on which we get a return.<\/p> <p>  I know many rural villages.  I live near Cloone in County Leitrim.  It is a small village where the post office closed a few years ago.  There is very little there but there is huge potential.  I live in a rural parish called Aghavas where about 600 people live in rural scattered houses.  There is no town or village.  Next door to it is Gortletteragh which is the very same; there is no town or village.  Half the parishes in County Leitrim are probably like that.  There is no town or village.  We have a huge problem with rural planning where people cannot get planning permission.  If they want to go home and live in their local area they cannot get planning.  I acknowledge that is not the Minister's problem.  <\/p> <p>  I will address the local improvement scheme, LIS, for people living in rural areas.  Many cul-de-sac roads have been taken off the list for some reason or other.  They are no longer local authority roads, which they had been years ago.  The only way in which people can get work done on their road now is through an LIS, in which they would have to put up some of the money themselves.  In County Leitrim, there has been a long list of over 200 and good work was done last year in getting money for it.  Money has been put down.  I see &euro;10 million here on the list for it this year.  We need to get a lot more money put into it.  It comes back to the idea of investment.  When there is investment in a rural area, people feel valued.  That is what needs to happen here.  While the money that is there for it is welcome, it is not nearly enough.  That is the point.  I am sure the Minister and Minister of State will acknowledge it is not enough to cover the number of small country roads that are in that situation.  Many of them lead to a couple of houses up a lane where, for example, there are elderly people living who cannot get home help in.  There are a whole lot of issues that will be affected.  A small bit of investment could make a big difference.  Originally the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was supposed to provide this money and it did not do so.  I welcome that it is coming from somewhere.  It is not nearly enough for the under-investment over the past seven, eight or ten years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#M00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of the &euro;40,000 grant.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The proof that any scheme is working is that there is a major drawdown.

That is why I am looking at this pilot scheme in an effort to target precisely what Deputy Martin Kenny is talking about.  Its purpose is to give a substantial grant to see if a family or family member will go and live in a house.  We will come back with more detail on that scheme.  I am working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on it.  It is something I am looking at.  If we are going to bring in a pilot scheme, it has to be dealt with in a way that it is not too difficult to draw down from the scheme.  The people who are making the application need to be able to match whatever funding is needed.  It is something we are looking at.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the LIS and I am glad he raised it because I need to put a few things on the record.  I am annoyed with some of the local authorities and local authority members around the country.  I wish to make clear that I do not pick the schemes for the LIS.  I am the person who brought back the scheme.  This Department provided the funding for the scheme.  We do not pick the roads.  I resent some of the remarks from members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael that I am the one who picked the roads because I did not.  We wrote to local authorities and we asked them to send us a list of the schemes in order that we could put them up on the website to make sure the schemes are done.  It is a safety mechanism for the schemes.  The councils select them.  I saw a letter in the paper yesterday commenting on Meath.  Meath had only eight roads.  Meath County Council got &euro;359,000.  What I did with the scheme was that every local authority, big or small, got at least &euro;250,000.  That was the smallest amount they could get and &euro;1 million was the biggest amount they could get.  We only had &euro;10 million.  I did not pick any of the schemes.  There has been no change in the scheme since 2002.  I did not make one change in the scheme.  It was the same scheme and operated in the same way.  I did not interfere with it in any way.<\/p><p>I resent the remarks from people to the effect that I picked them.  Those people do not have the courage or guts to talk to officials in their own councils who make the decisions.  I did not change the rules in any way.  I am glad the scheme is up and running in Deputy Kenny's county and that the council there decided on 11 roads on the basis of the &euro;250,000 allocation.<\/p><p> Again, a newspaper made a comparison between Mayo getting so many roads and other counties.  It was not about the roads; it was about the funding.  The council in Mayo got &euro;855,000.  The council in Cork got &euro;1 million.  Donegal County Council was allocated &euro;884,000 but did not confine the list.  The council sent in a list amounting to &euro;70 million and wanted the Department to pick the schemes.  We are not picking the schemes.  The council has received a letter and if it does not prioritise its roads in the next two weeks, I will reallocate that money later on in the year to the local authorities.  I am not picking the roads and I will not pick the roads.  That is not my job nor is it the job of the Department.  We have no hand, act or part in respect of the roads - I am keen to put that on the record.  It is a matter for the local authorities.

We might discuss it briefly.  I refer to the Western Development Commission, WDC, under two headings.  There is a fair bit of money under the development heading.  There was a time that the WDC figured in the narrative of supporting businesses in rural Ireland etc.   People ask about supports and nobody seems to know of the WDC.  Has the Minister, Deputy Ring, interacted with it?  I refer to making it a substantial player, now that it has cash.  I refer to the WDC getting into the less developed areas, getting projects off the ground and supporting them.<\/p> <p>  On a second WDC issue, now that Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney is here, I will go back to something I raised earlier.  There is a commitment in the national development plan to look at the western rail corridor.  In any reappraisal of the western rail corridor, will it be possible to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Ross, will be persuaded that the WDC should be part of that and right at the core of any team looking at that reappraisal?  I refer to the WDC being at the monitoring committee overseeing that particular reappraisal.  The WDC has done much research work on development issues, population patterns, and commuting patterns.  It would have a significant contribution to make.  Some of us might worry about the kind of people who might be told to do that reappraisal.  I have seen it happen.

On what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said in respect of the rail review,  it is important that all of the stakeholders are consulted.  There are numerous stakeholders one might not think of who need to be consulted on this, including the Galway Port Authority and the Foynes Port Authority.  The western rail corridor needs to be looked at in light of the Brexit situation.  That needs to be factored in.  The working group that the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is chairing on the Atlantic economic corridor also needs to be consulted.  The terms of reference are important.<\/p> <p>  We must ensure that all of these people are consulted.  Local authorities as well as the WDC and the western regional authorities all have to be consulted.  It is bigger than just a railway link or putting a train on a track from Athenry to Claremorris.  We have to look at the bigger picture.  I hope that the Department of Rural and Community Development will have a major input into looking at and consulting on the whole process.  We must look at the positive  impacts it could have not just to the west of Ireland but for this whole Atlantic economic corridor that we are trying to create.  At this stage, because the review will be starting soon, it is important that there is engagement between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  <\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to say something about the local improvement schemes, LIS.  It was a fundamental positive for the Department of Rural Development.  I congratulate it.  There is a stack of roads that have to be done in every county.  They will not all be done in one year.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, mentioned the number of roads done so far.  That is so many gone off a list that was stagnant since 2010.  People might not realise what it means for rural people and the connectivity it creates.  We have to acknowledge that.  It would be brilliant if we could get the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to do matching funds.  We should engage with it on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCS2018042500002#O01400","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1524672000,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I will take the LIS and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, will take the WDC.

There has been a major increase in the roads programme this year.  We need the weather now for local authorities to start getting the work done and to identify where the real needs are in respect of roads.

It is also represented on the monitoring committee of the action plan for rural development and on the Atlantic economic corridor task force.  At the last meeting,  I think it was last month, in Limerick, we had a brief discussion on one of the sub-committees in respect of transport.  I brought up the issue of the western rail corridor.

I was talking about my own county.  There are people, however, who have an alternative view on this.  I refer to both council level and Oireachtas level.  I have heard numerous people, including colleagues of my own, dismissing the existing phase of the western rail corridor as being a white elephant, a waste of money and that nobody is using it.  That is totally untrue.  I have asked the Atlantic economic corridor task force to look at the existing figures, to be able to put those out and give an unbiased reflection of the reality on the ground.  It is a success story, something that is improving and something that has greater potential to grow and develop.  I have discussed this with the Minister, Deputy Ring, and I would like to see a role for this Department in respect of the western rail corridor.<\/p> <p>  I know Project Ireland 2040 makes mention of this in respect of the rail review.  The Deputy is correct and I believe that the WDC should have a role in that.  Irish Rail, if left to its own devices, might not come up with a result that would be in the interest of the west.  We have to look at something like this not for just today or tomorrow or five years, but ten, twenty and thirty years into the future.  We have to look at the whole issue of climate change, rural regeneration and all that goes with that.  The potential for the western rail corridor is huge.  I am fully supportive and it would be a retrograde step if we lost the line based on a short-term decision on an alternative use that would make it difficult to get it back for rail in the future.<\/p><p>I certainly would support the Western Development Commission having a role in that review.  Has the Chairman had an opportunity to invite representatives of the Western Development Commission to appear before the committee?  I have met the chairman and the chief executive officer, CEO.

I am trying to organise a date to meet its members in order to put forward some of my ideas and to hear the issues with which they would like to get involved or in which they believe they might have a role and whether the legislation establishing the commission needs to be changed.

Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure that nobody decides on a dimension that does not facilitate the traditional boats that were on the canals, namely barges.  It allows the existing maximum dimensional criteria that enable our canal heritage vessels to continue to use the system they were designed for.  Those involved in waterways who have boats are concerned that somebody would design a rule with a width less which would not facilitate these heritage boats.<\/p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to make sure that would not happen and that somebody would not decide that boats of a particular dimension were not allowed, which would have the effect of ruling out the use of heritage boats.  That is why I am proposing amendment No. 3.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 4 talks about the closing to navigation of any part of the canals.  It is amazing what downturns do and how circumstances change.  I am probably one of the few people here who lived through a time when we were closing railway lines.  Things are closed permanently.  The amendment proposes to insert the words \"within agreed procedures on a temporary basis due to an emergency or to facilitate a planned event or to maintain an upgrade\".  We have to have the power to close canals for all sorts of reason, including emergencies, planned events and upgrades, but what we want to guard against is their closure because somebody says it is too expensive to maintain some of the waterways and that we need to close them.

I also intend to bring forward a textual amendment on Report Stage to correct the subsection number on page 7, line 7, which should refer to subsection (6), not subsection (4).<\/p> <p>  I understand from where the Deputy is coming on amendment No. 3, but it is not necessary.  There are existing by-laws in place since 1988 and they have not been changed.  It is not necessary to qualify the section further.  The maximum dimensions set out are 18.7 m in length, 4 m in beam - the width - and 1.2 m in draft - the depth.  The canals have not changed in size since 1988.  The size is also determined by the width of the lock chamber and the depth of the canal.  While I understand the Deputy's concern, it is already sufficiently covered and the legislation is sufficiently adequate.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 10, Waterways Ireland is in the business of keeping the canals open.  It is investing in them for the benefit of users.  Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  It would be overly restrictive and limit the closing of navigations to emergencies.  I mentioned land drainage, flood management and the loss of water.  Waterways Ireland regularly issues marine notices, which I also mentioned.

We seek to insert this amendment to protect against anybody who would change the by-law to make it more restrictive.  We are seeking to guard against something a lot of us have seen in our political lives - unforeseen changes in policy.  I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.  It would only reinforce that we maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It would not be a burden on anybody, but it would stop an unforeseen change of policy that would restrict navigation to narrower boats and boats of a smaller draft.  The Minister has made a good case for my amendment.<\/p><p>On the second amendment, what we need to guard against is someone deciding at some stage that maintaining all navigations is too expensive and that there are other things we could do with the money.  The Minister is probably not aware that there was once a plan to close the Grand Canal in Dublin and build a road over it.  That is unlikely to happen now in the city, but it could happen somewhere else, particularly in rural areas, where we are often told things are too expensive.  The Minister is telling us that it will not happen.  Therefore, if she were to accept the amendment, it would not impede anything she intends to do, but it would stop some other Minister in the future who might not be as enlightened as her from closing a canal with the excuse that it could no longer be afforded.  Those of us who live in very rural areas are used to being told that things are expensive, not affordable, that not enough people are using them and that there is not enough demand for them.  Neither of the amendments would impede the current policy of Waterways Ireland, rather they would reinforce it by stating it was the policy, that it would remain the policy and that there would be no change to it.  The Minister has laid to rest any worry that they would have unforeseen consequences.  She is actually saying they would only put into law what was the absolute clear and unequivocal policy, as of today, of both the Minister and Waterways Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#D00900","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>I obviously did not make myself clear.

I know many people who do not buy the local newspaper to look at the small advertisements, although they might read the news.  They do not scour a newspaper every week on the off-chance there might be a notice of some obscure by-law that might affect them.  It would be in the newspaper at a fixed time.  Time and again we have seen that those methods of advertising cause all sorts of problems because people miss them before saying they did not realise something was happening.  With newspaper circulation dropping, it is becoming a less effective way of informing people.<\/p> <p>  With regard to informing the local authority, I would not like to depend on the local authority to tell me about it.  Putting it on the website is handy but one must keep checking the website as a result.  Moving from the 19th century to the 20th century to the 21st century means one can register with organisations - eurotender is an obvious example - and indicate an interest in all tenders to do with boats or whatever.  This will notify the person of a change, meaning that person will not miss a change in his or her sphere of interest.  The person would not have to keep checking on the off-chance that there might be a proposal for a by-law.  This provision would eliminate the problem we face perennially as politicians of people coming to us and saying they did not know something was going to happen.  It seems to be a reasonable proposal and it is a modern way of doing things.  I am sure when newspapers came initially, people might have argued we could shout it from the hill and light a fire but the argument was made that it was operational matter.  When writing the law the stipulation was made that such notices would be put in local newspapers.  This is just moving forward from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#H01200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>There is a difference between allowing interested parties to register for a mailing list and requiring that people are informed of by-laws in this way.

The Minister will agree with me that, as a society, we have treated the natural environment poorly over recent decades.  The sea around us has become a soup of plastic.  There has been a massive reduction in the ecosystem and the diversity of wildlife species in it.  We have seen the destruction of the natural environment in many different places.  The Oireachtas has a responsibility to ensure we pass on the depth and quality of natural diversity as best we can to the next generation.  We also have a responsibility to the farmers to ensure they can make a living.  Some of the details in this Bill do not resolve the difficulties farmers have.  We have a responsibility to make roads safe for people.  Local authorities can facilitate this with the cutting of hedges and ditches to ensure road users can get through.  We can achieve those three objectives but not with this Bill in its current format.<\/p><p>This Bill's measures will do damage to the ecosystem and the diversity of wildlife we have.  We have a symbiotic relationship with our environment, being dependent on the ecosystem around us.  Pollinators are one of the great examples of this.  Farming is dependent on the fact that there should be decent numbers of pollinators.  In-depth research in Germany and other countries has shown how there has been a stark reduction in pollinator numbers.  This is an accelerating process and not something which has been occurring for years.<\/p><p>Today, I had the opportunity to accept a petition from several different organisations which hold wildlife in their protection.

It would not be throughout the country or in areas which did not have populations of, say, yellowhammers.  It signs us up to the birds directive which states that member states should set out a general system of protection for birds during the periods of breeding and rearing of chicks.

Accordingly, as the birds directive has been incorporated into wildlife legislation, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  The birds directive specifically aims to protect all of the 500 wild bird species naturally occurring in the European Union.  Concerned with their decline, member states unanimously adopted the directive back in 1979.  Habitat loss and degradation are the most serious threats to the conservation of wild birds.  The directive, therefore, places great emphasis on the protection of habitats for endangered and migratory species.  It establishes a network of special protection areas, including all the most suitable territories for these species.  Under the birds directive, every member state must report on progress to the European Commission.  Our last report to the commission for the period 2008 to 2012 was submitted in 2013.<\/p> <p>  The habitats directive was adopted in 1992 to ensure the conservation of a wide range of rare, threatened or endemic animal and plant species.  There are about 1,000 animal and plant species which are protected under the directive.

What Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is raising is not connected to what we are trying to do.  The Bill is about extending the burning time by one month and extending the cutting time in August by one month.  I do not agree with what he said about roadside hedges.  No bird is foolish enough to make a nest on the side of a busy road and every road is busy now.  School buses, plant machinery and cars taking young people to school are up and down narrow country roads.  Birds do not nest in roadside hedges.  I would like these hedges to be cut all year round in the interest of the safety of walkers and cyclists and of people who have valuable cars.  They are trying to get up and down these roads and their cars are scratched and torn.  People's eyes are nearly taken out in the evening walking on these roads.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is trying to obstruct the legislation and is saying we are threatening birds and other wildlife but we have to consider people as well.  People are our priority.  There is so much ado here about safety on the roads and, at the same time, every attempt is being made to prevent us from cutting hedges.  If the Deputy was interested in preserving wildlife and ground nesting birds, in particular, why not deal with the mink, magpies, hawks, grey crows and foxes?  They are the guys that are hurting our ground nesting birds.  It is very, very wrong to suggest that because we want to cut trees overhanging our roads and roadside hedges, we will damage the bird population around the country.  I am sorry that I cannot support the Deputy's argument.  I have nothing against birds but there are other ways to protect them.  The Deputy will not protect them by saying we cannot cut hedges.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is about extending the burning period by one month.  It has been discussed long enough.  The Bill started out with the intention of dealing with the burning and cutting of hedges, especially roadside hedges, for the safety of the people travelling the roads.  I cannot understand why the canals were introduced into it.  Was it to cloud the issue?  The farming population and road users will not put up with the conditions they have to operate under currently.  People cannot get up or down any road because of overhanging trees and so on and something must be done.  There is a lot of talk about stopping a fellow having a pint and a half from driving but what happens when a branch falls off a tree - and it only needs to be the length of someone's arm - and it hits the windscreen of some woman taking her children to or from school and she dies?  A family is left without a mother.  During the last storm, three people were killed in this way.  We need to get real and talk about people.  I was brought up to love animals and all wildlife but we must protect people first and that is what I thought the Bill was about.  The Deputy and his party are entitled to bring another Bill relating to birds before the D&aacute;il but he should not try to obstruct what we are at here today because time is moving on and we need to deal with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#M01900","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>We have a fundamental difference of opinion on the ecology we want to protect and develop in our uplands and among our hedgerows.

My view is this.  If there is a contested scientific issue about how best to develop our ecology in these degrading and in-crisis habitats, I argue that the approach should be scientific and that scientific research is needed, rather than legislation.  I have never seen circumstances where one says we will use legislation as our research tool.  I would have no objection to the Minister saying she was going to engage in a major study of how best to protect these habitats, on which I have strong views.  That the Minister would come in with her hobnailed boots and set out legislation, even with a break-out clause after two years, in my mind, is not the proper approach.<\/p><p>There was consultation which concentrated on the uplands issue.  That is the section we seek to delete in this amendment.  There was a very good submission made by the Irish Wildlife Trust in the consultation process.  In its submission, under the heading of scientific basis, it included a quote from the Ember Project which was carried out on similar uplands in the United Kingdom - I understand on the Pennines.  It looked, on a scientific basis, at the effect of burning on uplands between areas where permission had been applied for and those where it had not.  People were saying the burning was justified on the basis that it was protecting the habitat of grouse.  As I understand it, it was the first time that detailed scientific research and analysis were carried out which showed that there was major environmental degradation, including a change to the water table which had an effect on the stability of the peat bogs in the region, which often led to degradation of the peat boglands.  There are also implications in terms of issues with run-off into water streams.  There is a major effect on insect life, ecohydrology and bird life.  It varies between different species.  That one study alone could be presented as a case for moving away from burning as an ecological management tool on uplands.  <\/p><p>The Irish Wildlife Trust called - rightly, to my mind - for an end to all burning.  I cite as an example George Monbiot, the great English environmental journalist, who has made a real assessment of what is actually happening on these uplands, where we see that the natural state condition has been degraded and denuded of wildlife and that the process could be reversed in a way that would be hugely significant and beneficial in terms of protection and biodiversity.  However, there is none of that in the Government's approach.  There is just a continuation of the current system and an extension of the burning period as if it was ecologically progressive.  I fundamentally disagree and would like to see a much wider, bigger vision for how we could extend biodiversity, store carbon and provide a livelihood for people, particularly in rural areas.  <\/p><p>The Origin Green advertisement, with all of the lovely videos with violin music in the background, runs contrary to the reality that under Fine Gael there is no concern or care for the environment, of which the Bill is a symptom.  There are specific concerns.  The Minister says it is part of a series of protection measures to restore curlew numbers.  I would love to see the scientific papers that would back that up.  We have time between now and Report Stage to have a detailed argument about whether this will be a help in the fight against the extinction of the curlew, which would be of seminal significant importance in dealing with the ongoing and widespread loss of biodiversity we are seeing.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister's contention that this is a positive environmental measure.  We should delete the section and not have any extension of the burning period; we should instead come up with a proper Government strategy for uplands and a different vision for how we could use them that would be in tune with a world facing climate change and shrinking biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#N02600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  It is important to say the legislation does not abrogate the need for the directive.  Birds and animals are and will remain protected.  There was a successful prosecution of a case involving hedge-cutting in Monaghan in February.  I also acknowledge the practicalities mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  <\/p> <p>  On the curlew, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan referred, our expert is Mr. Barry O'Donoghue who has said burning is not suspected as a significant cause of the population decline, given that localised burning was a traditional practice on the hills throughout the time when the curlew and other species such as red grouse flourished in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  It is important, when we discuss issues as important as the natural heritage, that we do not scaremonger and that we do not use hyperbole or emotive language in place of looking at the facts.  To suggest the provisions of the Bill dealing with burning will threaten the conservation status of certain bird or wildlife species is simply not a fair representation of the facts.  Some 14% of the land of the country has been designated under the habitats and birds directives.  Burning in any designated area is an activity which requires ministerial consent.  Another fact is that it is controlled or managed burning.  It is not indiscriminate at any stage or does not occur at any time anybody feels like it.<\/p><p>It is managed burning and it is not indiscriminate.

Burning in March will only be allowed if it is carried out in accordance with very strict statutory regulations which I will make and which will be designed to protect wildlife and to conserve our natural heritage.  The regulations will limit burning to the current year only.  Under section 22 of the Wildlife Act, it is an offence wilfully to destroy, injure or mutilate the eggs or nests of any bird species.<\/p><p> The provisions of this Bill are on a pilot basis only and have a limited lifespan of two years.  It is important that such things are understood by people on all sides of this debate.  I want to see what can be learned during the pilot phase on the role of habitats, species management and the regeneration of burning.  I would be more than happy to have the widespread involvement of all stakeholders, especially NGOs which are interested in working with my Department on the issue.<\/p><p> I understand that Michael Viney is not an ecologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#N02700","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>He is not a bad ecologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#O00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>In answer to the Deputy's point about Fine Gael, the year 2013 was two years after the Green Party was in Government.

People have been speaking about what happened in Connemara in April and May of last year and suggesting it could become legal if we bring in this law.  It would not become legal and that is for two reasons.  First, it did not happen in March and, second, it was out of control burning that seriously damaged hills against the wishes of local farmers.<\/p><p>Fires on hills almost always start in very dry weather in the warmer months of April, May and June.  If there are uncontrolled burnings and outbreaks of fire for which it is difficult to determine the reason, they do not happen in February and March.  What causes fires?  As the poet Raftery said in Anach Cuan:<\/p><blockquote>M&aacute; fhaighimse sl&aacute;inte is fada a bheas tr&aacute;cht ar<br \/><br \/>an mh&eacute;id a b&aacute;thadh as Anach Cuan.<\/blockquote> <p>When he tries to curse the place where the accident happened, which was not Anach Cuan but Newcastle in Galway, he talks of &quot;Loscadh sl&eacute;ibhe&quot;, which is still the Irish term for a mountain fire.  It happened in Raftery's time but all the birds and habitats survived.  I imagine that a lot of it happened from natural causes and a lot of lessons can be learned from that.  Uncontrolled burning is unacceptable but normally happens in very dry weather.  We have exacerbated the risk of uncontrolled burning by destocking too much, which makes the mountains very woody.  When heather becomes woody it lights and the fire is a lot worse than if it had been grazed.  As we saw in Cloosh last year, when a fire gets out of control, it is very hard to bring it under control because the bog goes on fire after a while.  Many measures to limit this growth reduce the incidence of fire and fire damage rather than increase it.  They also reduce the risk that a small fire becomes a big fire.  February is not much of a month for burning in the Irish climate and nor was March this year, as snow does not burn too well.  There is, however, a better chance of doing controlled burning in March, if that is the best remedy to prevent a much worse catastrophe.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have any statistics on the amount of controlled burning that took place this year, last year or the year before?  Does she have any report of the amount of uncontrolled burning that has taken place in those years and the damage caused in each case?  When such things are measured, it tends to be found that uncontrolled burning is done to control unwanted vegetation and to get rid of woody vegetation from mountains.  This stops the uncontrolled burning from happening through spontaneous combustion or any other method.  There is always a risk of someone coming into a rural area and lighting a fire.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently had the temerity to penalise farmers for hills that got burned last year through no fault of their own, which are under appeal at the moment.  The Department blamed the farmers but we were able to get letters from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stating that no suspicion attached to the farmers, who are shareholders in the commonage, and that they were not being investigated under suspicion of having lit the fires.  It is far from reality to suggest that it is the farmers who are lighting illegal fires on this hills.  It is false ecology to think that this amendment will decrease burning.  It will lead to a much higher risk of burning on the hills on account of all the woody vegetation there will be.<\/p><p>I will not support this amendment.  I am one of the few Deputies present who has had responsibility for hill farms when I was manager of a co-op which had 1,000 acres of hill land rented at one stage.  I lived there and worked for hill farmers for a long time and I know that they hate one thing, which is uncontrolled burning on their hills.<\/p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the curlew.  If we want to protect the curlew where I live, it is not the burning that is the problem.  The biggest challenge we face is that the curlew is a very smart bird.  It nested in the islands in Lough Corrib because foxes cannot swim, but mink can, and mink are playing havoc on the islands.  If we are concerned about this, we should do something about the mink.  It is not controlled burning that is the problem, although nobody can justify uncontrolled burning, and I am opposed to anybody who destroys a farmer's land by uncontrolled burning.<\/p><p>The Minister might give us the statistics on controlled burning and how many hectares of land have been destroyed by uncontrolled burning each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#O00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>I will have to get back to the Deputy with statistics and they are primarily something the Garda would have.  I want to be clear that the Heritage Bill is not about illegal burning.  The Deputy is correct about controlled burning and it will greatly reduce the chances of wildfires taking hold in upland areas.  Large areas of unmanaged heather or gorse are not good for biodiversity and provide fuel for wildfires during dry spells, and that is what we saw happening last year.  Storm Emma hit at the start of March this year, and just up the road in Northern Ireland, burning is permitted throughout March, and in upland areas it is allowed up to 15 April.  This Bill would bring us in line with other jurisdictions like Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  There are benefits to managed burning.  The old growth strands of heather and woody stems cannot be managed by grazing, for example.  It helps to create a diverse mix of habitat, both open and closed, a canopy of Calluna or heather, and it is of benefit to species like grouse and the hen harrier for ground nesting.  There would be open areas for grouse for rearing chicks.  New heather growth is essential for grouse rearing chicks, who feed exclusively on Calluna shoots.  Other upland species, such as golden plover, mountain hare, lark and meadow pipits all benefit from the diversity created by managed burning.  Unmanaged burning over long periods, in contrast, results in extensive upland areas seeing irreversible change to habitat.  For example, heather growth would be replaced by purple moor grass, and this change displaces species like grouse and the hen harrier.<\/p> <p>  Burning during the months of April, May and June will destroy all ground-nesting birds and their chicks, and small mammal and lizard populations are also seriously impacted by this.  The high densities of breeding curlew do not arise from burning but rather because of predator control and an abundance of habitat.  Nonetheless, it shows that if managed properly, with due regard for timing and location, burning need not impact breeding curlew territories.  The task force stakeholders in this area include the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, BirdWatch Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na, farmers and individual experts.

Last year or the year before there was only one application for a licence for controlled burning in the State but there were 70 cases of burning outside of that.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with the top of the iceberg to a certain extent and we must deal with the rest as well.  There is no doubt there are major concerns about the management of landscapes and ecosystems.  There has been a radical deterioration in the health of particular species.

According to recent Central Statistics Office data, environmental protection annual spending was approximately &euro;600 million per year before our time in government, and during our time in government it averaged over &euro;1.1 billion.  Since Fine Gael has taken power, it has dropped to an average of approximately &euro;400 million, or a third of what it was in our time.  I am proud of that record as we have paid serious attention to the need for environmental protection.<\/p><p>I agree with those who said earlier that the real problem is uncontrolled burning but in this legislation we are throwing matches around the country up to March.  How will one tell when there is smoke on the mountain if it is a legal fire or uncontrolled?  Currently, we can tell that any fire at that time would not be appropriate.  We are giving an effective <i>carte blanche<\/i>for uncontrolled burning to take off earlier.  In a world of climate change, there may be circumstances not seen this year where there could be a very dry early spring and uncontrolled fires could take off.  We are throwing petrol on the flames because we do not have a National Parks and Wildlife Service that is fit for purpose.  In resourcing enforcement, we must address that service.  We are not only throwing matches around but we are doing it without having any real fire protection procedures or resources.  For all those reasons it would be far better to do the research.<\/p><p>It is true that the loss of the curlew is complex.  I argue much of it is due to habitat loss, particularly from peat extraction in what were traditional wet and marshy upland areas best suited to the curlew.  From an ecological perspective we consider the entire system and we should examine uplands in an holistic fashion as a connected system.  We should design them for maximum biological protection.  An extension of the burning season does not in any way support that.  The Minister has slightly changed her comments.  She started by saying this would be good for the curlew but it is not.  The loss of the curlew may not just be due to upland burnings but it certainly will not help.  The continuation of the current practices and system leaves a lack of attention to the fact that our uplands environments are seriously degraded and not meeting ecological imperatives.  We should be doing this in a much broader and more holistic way rather than just extending the burning season, which does nothing but bad things in my mind.<\/p><p>Does the Minister refute the findings of the report from the UK presented by the Irish Wildlife Trust?  The main reason she set out for the burning practice is to allow for grouse or other bird management by cutting back heather.  It would seem there is a significant UK study indicating that is a false scientific argument and we should change our policy on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018042500002#P00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1512,"content":"<p>I have never heard of a controlled burning getting out of control.  Normally the rules are so stringent that cannot happen.  We need to get to the nub of this and we have a problem with overgrowth on the hills.  Some of that is due to overly prescriptive destocking.  The question is how to control this vegetation that is highly lethal in very dry months.  Is it better to have a controlled system of \"a stitch in time\"?  We know controlled burning does not get out of control but uncontrolled burning does all the time.<\/p> <p>  We inherited from previous generations a fantastic ecology in the hills.  European grants initially upset that because of overstocking and we tried to rectify that but it was like a rocking boat and it fell the other way in certain cases.<\/p><p>All sorts of things were changed and many of them by outside forces.  I have spent a long time working with farmers.  Rather than bringing a very narrow science, for generations they developed a management system that balanced everything, including wildlife, ecology and the birds that we all value.  I often think that if we involved farmers more, and took more of the old advice that gave us the ecology we have then we would have a better set up.  Instead, we lurch all over the place bringing in laws without consulting the one group of people who really understand the interlacing of everything in their areas and we often, in my view, do more harm than good.   <\/p><p> I live in the hills of Connemara.  I do not own land myself and it is a long time since I had responsibility for farming in the west of Ireland.

They will recognise controlled burning taking place now and again as being preferable to the alternative that they will get, partly through nature and maybe through other people lighting fires on their land or neighbouring land, which is uncontrolled burning.

It came from outside and for different reasons.  Uncontrolled burning took place in March because it was illegal to burn after the month of February.  When places are overgrown they become useless.  In addition, one cannot burn anything in May and June so one must wait another year.  That is what has happened for the past eight to ten years.  When such places grow out of control then fires happen, which are uncontrolled.  We want a control system where farmers can burn in March.  Please give them the extra time.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan has made a great case for a soft border in the D&aacute;il but at the same time he wants us to be different in the South.  Farmers can burn above the ditch in the North of Ireland until 31 March and, in some hilly areas, as late as 15 April.  Why make a different case for farmers in the South?  I am a farmer and so are the men seated in the Visitors Gallery.  Many people are watching what we are doing here today at this meeting.

The purpose of our meeting today is to engage on the proposed MetroLink and its impact on local amenities, in which there is significant interest.<\/p><p>MetroLink is a major national development.  It is a north-south urban railway service that will run between Swords and Sandyford, connecting key destinations, including Dublin Airport.  This 26 km route across Dublin city will service 25 stations, 15 of which will be new and a large portion of the route, mostly on the north side of the city, will be underground.  It is expected to create about 4,000 jobs during construction, which will have a very significant impact on the economy nationally and regionally.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, recently launched a public consultation process on the emerging planned route.  Members of the public have until Friday, 11 May to submit their views and opinions on MetroLink.<\/p><p>The request to raise this issue at a committee meeting came from Deputy Rock and other members who were anxious that it would take place.  The key issue was the timeline in terms of public consultation and allowing the views of people to be heard.<\/p><p>I welcome all the witnesses.  There will be seven opening statements and I will call on witnesses to make their opening statement in the following order: Ms Anne Graham, chief executive officer, and Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer and director of transport investment of the NTA; Mr. Michael Nolan, chief executive officer and Mr. Peter Walsh, director of capital programme, TII; Mr. Michael Dowling, chairman, and Mr. Eamonn Mahon, honorary secretary, Home Farm Football Club; Mr. Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, chairman, and Ms Bernie Caffrey, past chairman, Na Fianna; Ms Anu Meehan and Ms Elaine Gahan, Prospect Architectural Conservation Area; Ms Marcella Nic Niallaigh, principal, and Mr. James Hart, parent, Scoil Mobh&iacute;; Ms Carmel de Grae, principal, and Ms Caroline Conroy, chairperson of the parents' committee, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona.<\/p><p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  I will ensure that everybody's voice will be heard.  I remind members and witnesses to switch off their mobile phones.<\/p><p>Today, the committee members have been joined by other Oireachtas Members.  Two of our members have written to the secretariat.  Deputy Troy has asked Deputy Lahart to represent him at this meeting and Deputy Munster has stated that she wishes to share time with Deputy Ellis.  I accede to both requests.  The tradition has been that those Oireachtas Members who are not members of the committee are called after members of the committee have spoken.  Specifically, Deputy Shortall has been in touch with me and requested witnesses who have been happy to come before us.  I will be happy to call public representatives from the constituency who drop in and anybody else thereafter.<\/p><p>There will be a question session after the presentation.  I will try to ensure that everybody will be heard and everybody will be listened to.  We will be fair and equitable to everybody. <\/p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to remind those present of the following information.  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority, to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#B01100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524659400,"counter":1566,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend.  I understand the committee wishes to focus upon the MetroLink project and the impact of construction on recreational amenities.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions from the committee, I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer with the authority.<\/p> <p>  The MetroLink project is the development of a north-south urban railway service that will run between Swords and Sandyford, connecting key destinations including Dublin Airport and the city centre along the 26 km route.  A large proportion of the route will be underground, including where it passes under the important city centre area and Dublin Airport.  The underground section will terminate close to Charlemont stop on the Luas green line, where the metro will connect to, and run southwards on, the existing Luas green line.  The Luas green line will be upgraded to metro standard as part of the project. <\/p> <p>  There will be a total of 25 stations, including 15 new stations, 3,000 additional park and ride spaces, and a journey time of approximately 50 minutes from Swords to Sandyford. <\/p> <p>  A map of the overall MetroLink route is provided.  <\/p> <p>  The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 identified the provision of two metro projects, metro north extending from Swords to the south city centre, and metro south, which would further extend metro services southwards along the existing Luas green line. <\/p> <p>  Under the recently published National Development Plan 2018-2027, those two separate schemes have been combined into one metro project, now referred to as MetroLink.  The combining of the two schemes has a number of advantages.  First, it maximises the use of the tunnel boring machines that will be purchased specially for the project; second, it avoids the future disruption and high unit cost associated with the building of the short missing piece of tunnel between St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and Charlemont in the event that only metro north was constructed; and it allows the major growth that is expected on the green line over the next decade to be accommodated on the higher capacity metro system.<\/p> <p>  MetroLink will provide new and important public transport connection opportunities along its route.  These will include interchanges with the commuter rail services at Tara Street station and Glasnevin station.  At Tara Street station, the new MetroLink station will be fully integrated into the existing mainline rail station, providing an efficient linkage for passengers transferring between MetroLink and DART services.<\/p><p>A new integrated MetroLink and commuter rail station will be provided at Glasnevin, which will facilitate passengers transferring between metro and commuter rail services on the Maynooth and Kildare lines.  MetroLink will also link with key routes of the bus system and the separate BusConnects project will ensure ease of connection between buses and the metro at the relevant stations.  In addition, MetroLink also connects with the Luas system at O&rsquo;Connell Street, Charlemont and Sandyford.  A park and ride facility for more than 3,000 cars at Estuary will allow commuters to leave their cars and use the metro service to access the city, reducing overall road congestion.  A map showing the integration between MetroLink, Luas and the heavy rail network is attached to this statement, and is included in the public consultation material. <br\/><br\/>There will be many benefits to the MetroLink project which will support the future development and growth of Dublin&rsquo;s capital city.  It will greatly enhance public transport capacity and accessibility to the city centre and the surrounding corridor for commuters, businesses, retail, education, tourism, as well as the overall sustainability of the city.  There will be an improvement for domestic and international travel connections provided by access to and from Dublin Airport and through the national rail and road network.  There will be decreased road traffic congestion on journeys to and from the airport and crossing the city from north to south.  MetroLink will include a park and ride for over 3,000 vehicles at Estuary, Swords.  There will be faster journey times by MetroLink between Swords, the airport, the city centre and towards Sandyford, with high frequency and high reliability.  There will be a more integrated and improved quality of interchanges with Luas, DART, Irish Rail and bus transport hubs across the city, with more direct journey opportunities.  MetroLink can enhance social inclusion, providing new links from urban areas of Dublin to jobs and services in the city and across the suburbs.  The project will support both the regeneration of existing areas and the development of new areas.  It will generate employment during construction and operation and will support economic growth once operational.  The metro system will support the environment by promoting a modal shift from car to public transport.  This will help reduce emissions and energy consumption in addition to improving air quality and reducing road congestion.<br\/><br\/>The estimated cost of the MetroLink scheme is approximately &euro;3 billion in current year values.  This is a preliminary estimate, in advance of public engagement and fully developed designs.  The exact cost can only be fully established subsequent to taking the outcome of the public consultation process on board, the further development of the project and the finalisation of the planning process.  In line with the public spending code, a comprehensive business case will be prepared for the MetroLink project at the relevant project stage.  This will provide a full appraisal of the project, including the quantification of its benefits and its costs.  That business case will form part of the final decision-making process for the project and will be made publicly available.  In advance of the preparation of the comprehensive business case, an initial cost-benefit analysis has been prepared based on the current project details.  A copy of this analysis is available on the MetroLink website at <i>www.metrolink.ie.  <\/i>It indicates that the project has a very positive economic performance, with benefits in excess of twice the project&rsquo;s costs, excluding the additional wider economic impacts likely to be delivered by the project.<br\/><br\/>The National Transport Authority, NTA, is responsible for strategic transport planning and the procurement of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area in line with Government policy.  As such, we have worked closely with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in the development of the emerging preferred route for MetroLink.

I am appearing alongside my colleague Mr. Peter Walsh, director of capital programmes.<\/p> <p>  While the invitation identifies the MetroLink project and the impact of construction on recreational amenities as the matter for discussion, I would like to take the opportunity to set out the purpose, nature and extent of the non-statutory public consultation process which is currently under way.<\/p> <p>  Over the last year, TII, in partnership with the NTA, has identified an emerging preferred route, EPR, for the MetroLink project.  The EPR was identified as the route option which performs among the best in terms of public transport demand, integration with the wider public transport system and economic return.  Both the NTA and TII recognise that it is important to involve the public, businesses, residents, local authorities, political representatives and all other key stakeholders in the development of the MetroLink project.  We have commenced a major public consultation concerning the emerging preferred route for the project.  This emerging preferred route is the proposal identified as being the optimum route for the project, subject to the outcome of the public consultation process.  This consultation process will allow us to take on board the views and inputs of the various parties and key stakeholders who participate and enable us to identify and consider concerns and issues that emerge.<\/p> <p>  On 22 March, TII and the NTA jointly announced the publication of the emerging preferred route for MetroLink.  Notices were placed in the national press advertising the public consultation events.  A scheme website was established where interested parties could access detailed information concerning the analysis leading to the recommendation of the emerging preferred route and register their interest in the scheme.  The launch also marked the formal commencement of a non-statutory public consultation.  Public consultation events were held between the 22 March 2018 and 18 April 2018 at locations along the emerging preferred route, with over 3,000 people attending the events.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the impact of construction on recreational amenities.  MetroLink is a huge engineering project, both in national and international terms.  Constructing such a large scheme in a built-up urban area is not possible without impacting people, businesses and property.  We have strived to minimise the impacts in the planning work done to date, and we will seek to further mitigate these impacts as the project develops.<\/p> <p>  At some locations, the MetroLink proposal impacts on recreational amenities.  These include the grounds of Na Fianna and the grounds of Home Farm FC, which are located on St. Mobhi Road, where a metro station is intended to be located and where a tunnel construction site is proposed.  It is difficult to find locations for tunnel stations and for construction sites in a built-up urban area which do not have an impact.  Such construction sites are inevitably located in open spaces.  In these specific instances, the choice was between directly impacting on homes and local businesses or locating temporary construction sites and future stations in open spaces.<\/p> <p>  We are very aware of the concerns that these clubs have about the published proposals and of the importance of their facilities both to the clubs themselves and to the wider community.  There has been constructive and respectful engagement on these issues between ourselves and officials of the two clubs, and we sincerely thank the clubs for that.  Both NTA and TII are committed to working collaboratively with both organisations, subsequent to the conclusion of the current public consultation process, to address the issues raised and to find mitigating solutions that will ensure both clubs can continue to serve the needs of their members and fulfil the important and valuable roles they play in their local communities.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we preserve the integrity of the public consultation process currently under way and allow that process to proceed to a conclusion.  This will ensure that we identify and address all of the relevant concerns and issues in a holistic way.  Our goal is to provide a greater benefit from public transport investment for the entire community while endeavouring to reduce the impacts to the extent possible.  For that reason, we have committed to discussing possible proposals to ameliorate the MetroLink impacts on the clubs&rsquo; operation within weeks of the conclusion of the public consultation process.  We recognise the need to respect the ongoing public consultation process and allow it to reach its conclusion.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to discuss possible alternative proposals here today.  I trust that the committee members will understand this position.<\/p> <p>  I note that the emerging preferred route will impact on residential and commercial properties.  As part of the public consultation and in parallel with the public consultation events, we engaged and continue to engage extensively with the affected parties on a daily basis.  Meetings have been taking place with land and property owners directly affected by the proposed MetroLink stations and alignment and their representatives.<\/p> <p>  The current public consultation will conclude on 11 May 2018, following which TII will review the emerging preferred route in light of its input.  The preferred route may incorporate findings from these consultations where these point to opportunities for improvement, while preserving the benefits and objectives of the scheme.  It is intended that an application for a railway order, which is the statutory planning consent procedure, will be made by TII to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the end of next year.  The approval of the scheme is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If planning consent is granted, it is expected that construction will commence in 2021 and that project will be completed in 2027.  We are working to an ambitious programme for the delivery of this transformational element of the capital&rsquo;s transport infrastructure.  We look forward to the support of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1569,"content":"<p>I will call Mr. Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; next and then Mr. Michael Dowling.

Ar son Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna, gabhaimid &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas libh as ucht an cuireadh a thabhairt d&uacute;inn teacht chuig Tithe an Oireachtais agus &aacute;r mbar&uacute;il a roinnt de MetroLink agus den bhealach is dealraith&iacute; a roghn&oacute;far at&aacute; curtha chun cinn ag Bonneagar Iompair &Eacute;ireann.  Na Fianna is supportive of a metro rail service for the north side of Dublin and acknowledges the benefits it could bring to our community.  However, we believe the construction and development of such a rail service must be balanced and proportionate.  In particular, its construction and operation should endeavour to minimise the disruption it brings to people, including to their day-to-day activities and their physical and social environment as well as the social infrastructure.  We firmly believe that the current proposal for the emerging preferred engineering route and the tunnelling site is neither reasonable nor proportionate, especially when one considers the major and truly adverse implications it will have on our club community, the adjoining schools, Home Farm FC and the broader Glasnevin and St. Mobhi Road community.<\/p> <p>  As we often experience difficulty relating to the scale of the effect of Na Fianna's activities on our local community, I wish to take some time to familiarise the members of the committee with the activities of our vibrant and unique urban Gaelic community.  Since our foundation in 1955, many committed and diligent members of our community have dedicated a large part of their lives to build a self-reliant, volunteer-based, inclusive Gaelic community.  The fruit of their diligent work has delivered a unique and extremely successful sporting and cultural institution that is known today as Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna.<\/p> <p>  Based in the heart of Dublin 9, just 3,500 m from the city centre, Na Fianna is now one of the largest participatory sports, cultural and community-based organisations in Europe.  As of April 2018, we have 2,936 members and an additional 1,044 registered parents, combining to deliver us a community of 3,980 active participants.  From a sporting perspective, we field 166 teams across all our codes of indigenous Gaelic games, that is, Gaelic football, ladies' Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, handball and rounders.  Our ethos is about local community engagement and inclusiveness.  Our goal is to have a team for everyone regardless of age, gender or sporting ability in order to maximise participation.  Our active members range in age from four to 70.  To reflect a growing engagement of young females, I am happy to relate that 40% of our players are female.  Our 346 volunteer mentors support our sporting teams.  These committed individuals, trained by our club, offer up approximately six to ten hours of their time every week to help bind our community and keep our children and our local community fit and healthy in a positive environment.<\/p> <p>  As for our cultural activities, our work includes the daily hosting of a bilingual na&iacute;onra, or preschool; daily after-school care; weekly Irish language classes; Irish dance classes; public c&eacute;ilithe; and weekly public music sessions, which attract many musicians and singers.  Our games, cultural and social activities provide the glue that helps bind our community together.<\/p> <p>  In addition to our club-organised activities, we host a range of third-party social activities in our clubhouse, including weekly meetings of the Iona Bridge Club, the Corus choral group, arts classes, line dancing classes and a host of community-based events from table quizzes to christenings, communions, birthday parties and funerals.  In short, our clubhouse on St. Mobhi Road hosts the full range of life milestone events in our community from cradle to grave.<\/p> <p>  Our cultural work is beautifully complemented by the very close relationship we enjoy with our nearest neighbours, our adjoining Gaelic-speaking schools of Scoil Mobh&iacute; and Scoil Chaitir&iacute;ona.  We work closely and share the use of one another's facilities to create a unique, safe, educational, sporting and cultural Gaelic environment.  On every level we breathe the same air.  On St. Mobhi Road we have created a unique space, a vibrant breac-Ghaeltacht in which the children of our community have the option to be immersed in a Gaelic-speaking environment from preschool in T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g in Na Fianna to primary school in Scoil Mobh&iacute; and me&aacute;nscoil i Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona.  They may follow on to third level education, to Fiontar with our community partners up the road in Dublin City University.<\/p> <p>  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna is such a unique sporting and cultural creation that it now attracts approximately 20,000 international visitors per annum to experience Gaelic games.  They are provided with a unique insight into modern Gaelic culture through the medium of our national games and our club's extensive cultural activities.  All the work of our community is underpinned by selfless volunteerism and supported by the work of more than 38 committees or work groups all directed by our 15-person elected volunteer executive committee.<\/p> <p>  St. Mobhi Road and our site reverberates each day with community activity from 6 a.m., when our club gym opens, through to 9 a.m., when the grounds facilitate the arrival of students from Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona and Scoil Mobh&iacute;.  During the day, the club welcomes international visitors amid the students of some of the ten local primary schools with which our club-funded coaches work every week.  Most importantly, every evening and weekend, our grounds are filled with the laughter and banter of our young enjoying one another's company in a healthy environment.<\/p> <p>  In order to maintain our level of activity, we are currently required to use 14 facilities at different locations throughout our community.  The only one of these facilities to which we have unrestricted access in the long term is our site on St. Mobhi Road.  Prior to the TII announcement, we had struggled with a lack of access to green space in our community as our facilities are already at breaking point.  Unfortunately, the emerging preferred route proposed by TII for MetroLink involves requisitioning these grounds and shutting down our activities on St. Mobhi Road for the complete duration of the construction project.  Our site is proposed to be the first to be lost to public use and the last to be restored.  If the proposal proceeds in its current form, it will have a calamitous effect on the future of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna.  Our removal from the centre of our community will have serious long-term implications for our community.  It has the potential to negate years of careful and diligent work of generations of volunteers and social entrepreneurs.  It will transform a space which has been lovingly nurtured by generations of volunteers as a remarkable cultural and community centre into a construction site of an unprecedented scale.  It will silence the heartbeat of our local community.<\/p> <p>  The planned tunnel-boring site will effectively close down the most used gathering place of our community, leaving it silent.  A generation of children will be deprived of an opportunity to engage in healthy activity within their local community during their most formative years.  The seven small culturally aligned enterprises that operate from our clubhouse will face a challenge of a scale they may not survive.  The livelihood of the individuals from these ventures will be placed in jeopardy and the part-time work of 60 others will be lost.  In effect, our club facilities on St. Mobhi Road, that wondrous hive of sustainable community, cultural and healthy sporting activity, will be silenced.  We have made these views known to TII and will document them in greater detail in our submission to the public consultation.<\/p> <p>  To reiterate our core point, Na Fianna is supportive of a metro rail service for the north side of Dublin and we acknowledge the benefit it could bring to our community.  However, its construction and development must be balanced and proportionate.  We firmly believe the current proposal and the tunnelling site are neither reasonable nor proportionate and will have truly adverse implications for our club members and our wider community of north Dublin.

My name is Michael Dowling.  I am the outgoing chairman of Home Farm FC, and with me today is Mr. Eamonn Mahon, our club secretary.  We have both been involved with Home Farm for many years, in my case since I was a child.  Before discussing MetroLink, on behalf of Home Farm I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to our neighbours Na Fianna on the recent passing of their club secretary, Ms Deirdre Lambe.  We also extend sincere sympathies to Deirdre&rsquo;s family on their very sad loss.<\/p> <p>  Plans for the MetroLink project were published on the 22 March by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  I should put on record at this point that we in Home Farm recognise the importance and the benefits attaching to the MetroLink project as the Government seeks to develop and improve public transport in the city.  However, the plans as published have serious implications for our club and for Na Fianna, which have been well documented in recent weeks.  Under the proposals, Home Farm&rsquo;s grounds at St. Mobhi Road will be unavailable to the club for a period of approximately seven years, commencing in 2020.  This is on the assumption that the project proceeds as planned, with St. Mobhi Road as a main tunnelling and boring base and with a station.  <\/p> <p>  Home Farm FC has been an integral part of the north Dublin community since its foundation in 1928, some 90 years ago.  It provides football for over 500 players, ranging from four years of age to adults.  We also run a Saturday morning academy for young players who are starting out in the game.  The club is run by volunteers who give of their time day in, day out.  The club has had a base in St. Mobhi Road for more than 50 years.  The grounds were acquired by one of our founding members, the late Brendan Menton Snr., by arrangement with the Department of Defence which was based at the time in St. Mobhi Road.  Our main base is on the Swords Road in Whitehall.<\/p> <p>  Thousands of former players, including many Irish internationals, will have fond memories of their early playing days in St. Mobhi Road.  The pitch in St. Mobhi Road, which is part of a private and enclosed ground, is played on by teenage schoolboy and schoolgirl teams.  It is used on Saturdays and Sundays and for midweek games.  It is also regularly made available for cup finals and for representative matches.  It is of an extremely high quality and widely acknowledged as such.  The club has invested significant resources in the development and maintenance of the playing surface and ancillary facilities.  Home Farm FC has been assured by TII that suitable alternative arrangements will be made available as a priority to relocate our teams for the duration of the project, if it proceeds as planned.  It recognises the level of disruption involved and has indicated its commitment to addressing this in any proposals to be tabled.  Clearly, and at a minimum, whatever alternative facilities are proposed must be of a comparable high standard, they must be local and must be in place by the end of 2019.  The club has commenced discussions with TII to hear its proposals in this regard.  We will also be making a formal submission to TII with regard to the project. <\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the particular impact which the project will have on our neighbours, Na Fianna, as St. Mobhi Road is their main base.  We have indicated to Na Fianna and to TII that if we can play our part in helping to reduce in some way the level of impact and disruption for Na Fianna by way of modification of the plans we would open to hearing such proposals.  <\/p> <p>  The sporting and recreational needs of the boys and girls who represent the club are of paramount importance to Home Farm FC and it is their interest and need that we place in the forefront in our negotiations with the authorities regarding this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>Mr. Dowling and Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; represent the beating heart of their community.

I am a citizen representing Prospect Architectural Conservation Area, ACA.  I am here today with Ms Elaine Gahan, who is also a member of the committee.  I am also representing the wider community.<br\/><br\/>Our ACA is a residential enclave located east of Glasnevin Cemetery and the National Botanic Gardens, 2 km north of the city centre.  Our ACA is described by Dublin City Council as:<\/p><blockquote>An oasis of calm and tranquillity set against the backdrop of the trees of Glasnevin Cemetery and Botanic Gardens.  The area is special because of the historical association with Glasnevin Cemetery, having the original entrance to the cemetery with surviving gate and gate lodge, historical pub associated with the cemetery and the main access route, Prospect Avenue, having its origins in the opening of the cemetery.  It is the overall policy of Dublin City Council to protect and conserve the character and setting of the ACA.  <\/blockquote> <p>We also embrace progress and are committed to community development and inclusivity.<br\/><br\/>I, as well as the group I am representing, first became aware of the MetroLink project through the media and while seeing surveyors on Prospect Avenue taking measurements.  When I sought information, I was given the  contact details of TII.  There had been no prior contact from TII indicating that there would be any impact in our area.  We attended the public consultation in Glasnevin Cemetery and other members of the community attended the consultation at the Helix with National Transport Authority, NTA, and TII.  In both venues residents were given conflicting information and were left with many unanswered questions and a lack of clarity.<br\/><br\/>In light of the information obtained through the public consultation, Prospect ACA residents&rsquo; group sought feedback from local residents likely to be impacted by the emerging preferred route.  With considerable effort we managed to find the relevant reports on the MetroLink website.  Finding the Alignment Options report &ndash; a 362-page report - was onerous in and of itself.  The information booklet from NTA-TII issued as part of the public consultation process contains conflicting information relative to the website.  From the numerous maps available, it was extremely difficult to identify which properties would be impacted by the emerging preferred route.  One map within a document on the MetroLink website showed a slight variation of the same route.  The implications of this was that residents were unsure whether or not the lines will run underneath their properties.  There is still confusion.<br\/><br\/>After attending the public consultation events and in order to understand this process and seek clarity for members of our community, we arranged a meeting with Deputy Noel Rock.  A meeting with the entire resident cohort and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, followed.  Although we are grateful for our public representatives&rsquo; time and input, we are still left with many unanswered questions.<br\/><br\/>Feedback and concerns raised by members of our community encompass many areas, including the impact on our ACA, the iconic historic buildings, our community, health and safety, education and the implications for private homes and businesses.  Many of our residents have raised concerns regarding the public consultation process.  The process makes no distinction between those residents who are directly affected and those indirectly affected and, as previously highlighted, we have had no contact from NTA and very little from TII.<br\/><br\/>The period from the opening of the public consultation on 22 March to the submission date of 11 May 2018 is extremely short for ordinary citizens affected by this to comprehend the complexities of the work done by NTA and TII, which took years to complete with experts and a large budget.  For us, we have just a small number of weeks to wade through cumbersome documents, reports, maps and statistics without any level of expertise or funding.  The following is an example of how difficult it is to find and comprehend information provided in the reports impacting our ACA.  From a 362 page document &ndash; once found - the reader is then re-directed to a different report, which fails to provide any clarity. <br\/><br\/>The age profile of the properties in this area ranges from 1833 to 1905.<\/p><p>The vast majority of the ACA properties have no foundations; they were built on soil and rubble.  There is no precedent in Ireland for tunnelling under properties such as these.  As members will appreciate, many of our residents&rsquo; concerns relate to potential structural damage to their properties.  These concerns relate to all stages of the project, including long-term concerns such as structural issues emerging once the project is completed and while trains are running under their properties every two minutes.  Residents have not been contacted or reassured that structural surveys will be undertaken prior to, during or after this project.  No information has been provided regarding compensation, should this prove necessary, and the timeframe in which to pursue it.<br\/><br\/>Within our ACA, there are many iconic historic buildings, such as the Brian Boru pub, mentioned in James Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Ulysses<\/i>, which appear to have been proposed for compulsory purchase order, and this has also not been clarified.  The impact of a major train station in an area which, to date, has not even had a minor train station has not been addressed.  This is no mere underground station; the scale of the proposed station is running from the Royal Canal to Dalcassian apartments, which is proposed for CPO.  The iconic Brian Boru pub appears to be earmarked for destruction as part of this rail station development.  The impact of this proposed major train station will require a socioeconomic impact analysis.  At the moment, there is no reference in the proposal to the impact of this proposed station on the social fabric of an historic and well-established part of the city, not least of which would be the additional security measures that would be required and which are a necessary element of any major rail station.<br\/><br\/>Other concerns relate to the construction phase which has been estimated to be between two and six years.  Again, there has been no clarity from the NTA on this.  These concerns include some of the following: increased construction traffic in an already heavily congested area; parking; noise and dust pollution; and the health and safety of our residents with an estimated 100 trucks entering and exiting the proposed TBM site daily, which is in close proximity to our ACA.  No clarity has been provided in respect of the working hours of trucks and the times at which boring will take place.  As we have heard already, the TBM site has serious implications for the education, health, safety and sporting and recreational activity of approximately 800 children.  It will be decimating a mini-Gaeltacht area.<br\/><br\/>As an ACA, we work tirelessly to improve and enhance the aesthetics of our environment.  We are concerned and we are seeking reassurance that our ACA will be restored to its original state once the project is complete.  In addition, we seek clarity on whether there will be one or two tunnels and the implications of vibrations resulting from this for our properties.<br\/><br\/>The decision to choose this emerging preferred route appears to have been made on economic grounds, rather than on taking into consideration our culture, history, architecture, health, education, sporting amenities and the impact on our community.  Although the presence of an ACA is mentioned in the reports, no details are given of the impact this will have on our ACA and its residents.<br\/><br\/>We ask that a socioeconomic impact analysis be carried out to address the impact of a major rail station at the proposed site.  We also ask that the public consultation process be extended so that all those who will be affected will be given accurate information as to what this development entails and the implications for individuals at all stages of the process.  This extended public consultation process should indicate all the options considered and the reason for choosing this route ahead of all the others in order for this to be a fully transparent public consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anu Meehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1576,"content":"<p>That was very comprehensive.

I also invite the Chairman and other members of the committee to visit our school and the site to see for themselves exactly what I am describing.  Roinneann Scoil Mobh&iacute; an campas c&eacute;anna le na Fianna, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona agus an r&eacute;amhscoil T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g.  Su&iacute;omh &aacute;lainn at&aacute; ann i measc crainn agus p&aacute;irceanna imeartha.  Sa timpeallacht n&iacute; chloistear ach gl&oacute;r ph&aacute;ist&iacute; ag foghlaim, ag spraoi agus ag imirt le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; gaol ar leith idir na ceithre hinstiti&uacute;id ar an su&iacute;omh seo, gach uile ceann acu bunaithe agus d&iacute;rithe ar chaomhn&uacute; agus ar fhorbairt chult&uacute;r na h&Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  It is impossible to describe precisely what a tunnel boring machine launch site, support works and constructing a station will entail because those details have not been included by the NTA or TII in the public consultation.  However, based on what was envisaged for the equivalent site in the previous metro north proposal, it is likely to include: a tunnel launch pit; conveyor systems; cranes; a concrete batching plant; forklift trucks; compressor, pumps and hoists; and a complement of 100 staff.  It will be on a massive scale.  Every element of spoil removed by the tunnel boring machines will need to leave the site by truck.  That means, over a ten-hour working day, there will be a truck movement on or off the site every three to six minutes, at least half of which will be full of spoil.  The expected duration of the construction is six years but this will be the first sod turned in the project and the last returned.  A delay suffered anywhere else along the route will be felt at this site.<\/p> <p>  The school&rsquo;s concerns are too numerous to describe in detail here but I can at least outline them.  We have grave health concerns due to dust, diesel emissions, noise and vibration.  Those same factors lead us to conclude that effective education would be impossible during the construction period.  We have major safety concerns not just over the scale of the works envisaged but also because the proposal is to take away the only current vehicular access to the school and, materially, all its parking facilities for staff and parents at drop-off and pick-up times.  A large number of pupils walk, cycle or scoot to school across the site.  They would no longer be able to do this safely.  It is also a sad fact of life that large construction sites and heavy machinery attract the curiosity of children.  Having a site such as this sharing its perimeter with a na&iacute;onra, primary school, and secondary school is nothing less than an invitation for tragic accident.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, our concerns are not just for the school.  The proposal would tear apart a unique Irish-language community and the work of 60 years in bringing together an Irish-medium na&iacute;onra, bunscoil, me&aacute;nscoil co-located with a GAA club that at every turn supports and encourages Gaelic games, culture and language.  That such a proposal should have been brought forward in Bliain na Gaeilge and at the same time as the Irish language is being placed front and centre of Project Ireland 2040 is an irony that is truly heartbreaking.<\/p> <p>  We simply cannot understand how this proposal even came to be put forward and we cannot conceive of any way in which it could co-exist with the school.  We ask the NTA and TII to remove it from consideration at the very earliest opportunity.  That is because the detriment to the schools is felt now and not simply once construction begins.  Uncertainty over whether this proposal will move forward dominates, and will continue to dominate, the decisions parents take now, and in the near future, about whether to send their children to or keep them at our school, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona and T&iacute;r na nOg.<\/p> <p>  On Monday next, 30 April, the parents of pupils starting in na&iacute;on&aacute;in sh&oacute;isearacha in September will be visiting the school.  Based on calls I have already received, their first question will be about MetroLink and we need answers for them.<\/p> <p>  That concludes my introductory statement.  I hope I can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marcella Nic Niallaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1578,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat as ucht an cuireadh d&uacute;inn dul chun f&eacute;achaint ar an scoil agus an rud a thitfeadh amach muna mb&iacute;onn freagras s&aacute;s&uacute;il ar na ceisteanna go l&eacute;ir at&aacute; agaibh inniu.

Is mise Carmel De Grae, pr&iacute;omhoide Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona agus t&aacute; Caroline Conroy, cathaoirleach coiste na tuismitheoir&iacute; liom inniu.<\/p><p>T&aacute;im anseo ar son Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona, me&aacute;nscoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, comhoideachas, le 449 dalta sa scoile.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an deis againn &aacute;r mbuairt&iacute; a phl&eacute; maidir leis an su&iacute;omh in aice leis an scoil a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar l&aacute;r ionad tollta don MetroLink. <\/p><p> Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona was established by the Dominican Sisters in 1928 as the first all-Irish secondary school for girls in the country.  It was set up to promote, preserve and inspire a love for the Irish language and culture.  In 1987 the school became co-educational.  The majority of our students are drawn from Glasnevin, Drumcondra, Phibsboro, Ballymun and Finglas.<\/p><p> We are very proud of our great tradition of excellence.  We celebrate the achievements of our students academically, in sport and culturally.  Our past pupils have gone on to great success in all aspects of Irish life.<\/p><p> We are part of a shared campus with Na Fianna GAA club, Scoil Mobh&iacute; primary school and the Na&iacute;onra T&iacute;r na n-&Oacute;g.  We have a mutually supportive relationship with these organisations and together we form a vibrant breac-Ghaeltacht.  We share facilities and resources and there is a considerable overlap in our communities.  Our students benefit hugely from being a part of this community.  The facilities are used not just during school time but are available as a resource to the local community agus ba mhaith linn cuireadh a thabhairt don choiste teacht ar chuairt chun l&aacute;ithre&aacute;n na scoile a fheice&aacute;il.  We also would like to invite the committee to the school to experience and visualise what we have to offer.<\/p><p> The current proposal to locate a tunnel-boring machine launch site for the proposed MetroLink, directly at the school would render the school inoperable.  Parents from the school have already realised this and have expressed their worries to us that they would have to withdraw their children from the school should this go ahead.  It would not be possible in any practical way to run a school less than five metres from a substantial building site of historic proportions.  Our art room is about 2 m from the boundary of the proposed works.  The proposed use of the site on Mobhi Road as a boring site would have a detrimental effect on Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona in the following areas: the health and safety of our students and staff; the educational environment of our students and the working conditions for staff; the ability of our students to complete their State examination requirements; access to the school and traffic congestion; school enrolment; and the destruction of an all-Irish community.<\/p><p> I refer to the health and safety of our students and staff.  We are gravely concerned about the effect the increase in air pollution due to dust, diesel trucks and chemicals used on the site would have on the health of all students, employees and visitors.  Prolonged exposure to this increased air pollution would be particularly severe on those who suffer from asthma, bronchial impairment, breathing difficulties or cystic fibrosis, or who have a compromised immune system.  The proposed works will impact on their ongoing attendance at and enjoyment of Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona and Scoil Mobh&iacute;.<\/p><p> Teaching and learning would have to compete with hugely increased noise levels as the school would be trying to operate within a couple of metres of a building site of unprecedented size.  Realistically how could any school function with the noise levels that would come from this construction site?  Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona would also have reduced access to the facilities, sporting and otherwise, which we share with Na Fianna, Na&iacute;onra T&iacute;r na n-&Oacute;g and Scoil Mobh&iacute;.<\/p><p> The ability of our students to complete their State examination requirements would also be affected.  The requirements for State examinations are no longer simply terminal written examinations.  Assessment at junior certificate is ongoing with students undertaking school-based assessments in second and third year.  Practical exams and project work are now required in many subjects at leaving certificate level.  Preparation for these takes place in school throughout the whole school year.  There would be a serious negative impact on our students&rsquo; abilities to reach their educational potential with the disruption from the proposals.<\/p><p> I refer to access to the school.  The proposed works would create a serious difficulty for staff and students in actually getting to school and getting into the school grounds.  Mobhi Road is currently bumper to bumper on a daily basis.  Any construction will increase the gridlock for cars and public transport.  Due to the the site position, school buses would be unable to drop students on Mobhi Road.  Additionally, the drop off point in Na Fianna for both schools would not be available.  Parents have already expressed anxiety about the health and safety of students cycling or walking to school.  Construction traffic, which further jeopardises safe cycling and walking would contradict the policies of the various Government departments regarding physical and mental health and well-being.<\/p><p> The previous problems presume we still have a school enrolment.  Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona has an enrolment of 449 students which is the largest student body we have ever had.  Our primary school numbers are growing and we expect to grow our numbers in coming years.  This formed the basis of our application for additional accommodation which has been agreed by the Department of Education and Skills.  Since the announcement of this MetroLink consultation, we have had a steady stream of inquiries from parents who are concerned about sending their children to what will essentially be a building site for the duration of their secondary education.  They have indicated that if it goes ahead as planned, they will withdraw their children.  We would then go from a school with growing enrolment to one which would have threatened viability.<\/p><p> With Na Fianna, Scoil Mobh&iacute; and T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g, we have a well established, unique Irish language community on the north side of Dublin.  Scoil Mobh&iacute; and Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona are the only schools directly, adversely affected by the proposed MetroLink.  Both schools work as Gaeilge.  This project would appear to contradict Government policy to conserve and promote our language, heritage and culture of the community.  It seems counterproductive to provide a facility for a community which would then be destroyed in the process.  We are deeply committed to promoting the Irish language and culture.<\/p><p> In summary, fundamentally, the proposed plan will tear the heart out of the community&rsquo;s educational, cultural and sporting facilities.  We welcome the concept of MetroLink and any proposals to improve public transport and punctuality in Dublin but not at any cost.  No reason has been given to us for this location of the tunnel-boring machine launch site other than the engineering convenience.  Surely the impact on the community at the site must outweigh other considerations.  This has had an immediate, concrete impact on our school.  The proposals have generated uncertainty in our school community and among current and prospective students' parents.  It is urgent that we get clarity about those proposals in order to secure the future of the school.  We need that clarity before the end of this school year.  We have students who have places for next September whose parents need an answer on this.  We would respectfully ask TII to look for an alternative site which would not have such a devastating impact on the communities which are part of the heart and soul of the area.  We need a definite answer immediately to avoid a loss of enrolment.  We will be celebrating 90 years of Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona through 2018.  We hope that the school will be flourishing and that we will be celebrating our centenary in 2028.  We would be unable to achieve that aspiration if these proposals go ahead as planned.

It can be seen from the powerful testimonies from the community groups precisely why we needed to have a meeting like this though.  It is fair to say this is an unprecedentedly large project and an unprecedentedly large problem for the various groups which are facing up to this project right now.  I thank all those who facilitated my request on that and I thank all the groups for taking the time to come in and present to us here today.<\/p> <p>  Often in the Oireachtas we are accused of being reactive rather than proactive, that is why the timing of this was so crucial.  It was crucial to have it in advance of the closing of the public consultation deadline of 11 May 2018.  The timing, as can be seen from the two testimonies of the schools in particular, is absolutely of the essence.  We truly need to have clarity outlined from the two State bodies, with respect to any changes that are proposed to be made to the emerging preferred route as soon as possible after that 11 May 2018 public consultation deadline passes.<\/p><p>I cannot emphasise that strongly enough.  With respect, I put the two Stage agencies on notice in that regard.  I would appreciate a commitment from perhaps both Mr. Nolan and Ms Graham that they will endeavour to announce any changes to this route, or to the boring site in particular, as soon as is practically possible following the 11 May deadline.  The reason I emphasise this so strongly is that I know from the various consultations TII and the NTA have had with the various groups that a number of different dates and potential deadlines have been given, which gives rise to uncertainty.  As far as the schools and enrolment are concerned, there is a massive difference between a deviation being announced to the boring site in the middle of May and one being announced in the middle of July.  That has a knock-on effect in terms of enrolment, capitation and the potential viability of the schools and their operations going forward.  I just wanted to emphasise that at the opening of my remarks.  This is not to say that Prospect ACA, Home Farm and Na Fianna do not also have pressing timeline concerns.  However, Mr. Nolan and Ms Graham can see in this case that even if TII and the NTA were to announce a deviation to the boring site, the timing of it would be crucial to the schools in particular and their enrolment.  I would therefore appreciate if the two Stage agencies could come back to me with perhaps a proposed timeline or even a commitment to look at these issues with the greatest possible urgency.<\/p><p> I will probably put this question to Mr. Nolan.  In the event that boring is moved elsewhere, what implications would a station construction project on St. Mobhi Road have for either Home Farm or Na Fianna?  If a station were to remain at St. Mobhi Road, for example, and the boring site were moved elsewhere along a sliding scale, what would the cost implications be?  At what radius within the current proposed boring site does the boring site have to be in order to be viable?  I know people could propose putting it at either end of the line, but I presume there is some median point at which TII and the NTA want the boring site to be.  What exact radius is that from the proposed Na Fianna site?  Will TII and the NTA commit to clarifying the outstanding uncertainties for Prospect ACA in particular?  The witnesses outlined a number of issues in respect of which they seem to be uncertain, and I hope they might be able to fill in the detail of them, perhaps here or at a later forum in writing.  I would appreciate that.  I think this could potentially be resolved today.<\/p><p> I have another question, again for either Ms Graham or Mr. Nolan.  Do they accept that the level of consultation has been lacking to date?  I know they have worked quite hard to engage with, I think, each of the seven groups separately subsequent to the announcement of the project.  However, as for the early forays, when it is considered that some stakeholders were only told on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend before a Tuesday public announcement, and that I as an Oireachtas Member and a member of the transport committee had not heard about it in advance of the public announcement and, in fact, was told my a member of Na Fianna by email over that weekend, do the witnesses consider that to be an acceptable level of consultation?  When it is considered that there were only three weeks between the announcement of the project and the conclusion of the first public consultation date on the north side, do they consider that to be a good level of public consultation?  I think it leaves a little to be desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#G00300","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>I want to be fair to everyone.

The officials from the NTA and TII, the stakeholders, have given very comprehensive contributions and reports on the impact.  If I were to summarise it, the impact of this on the local community would be to close down a huge section of the community and to close down the heart of the community.  I will leave my comments at that because I wish to raise other issues.  I am Dublin spokesperson for my party and work alongside Mary Fitzpatrick and Councillor Paul McAuliffe.  I know my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was in the area and met some of the stakeholders recently, which is an indication of how seriously we take this matter.<\/p> <p>  Three clich&eacute;s come to mind.  I hope the Chairman does not mind my repeating them.  One is \"you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs\".  We are into scrambled eggs already at this stage before the process has even begun.  All I would say to residents is that my experience of infrastructural projects in my own constituency, such as the M50 and the Luas, is that the public comes last.  TII is a brilliant organisation, as is NTA, but while they may say things about public consultation really they are project-driven.  One will therefore need the support of one's public representatives right along the way to hold them to it.  If I were chief executive of any of these organisations, I would want to get the project delivered too.  That will be their focus.<\/p> <p>  What is this committee's function in respect of this matter?  We do not have any statutory role in this, do we?

First, we have oversight of this project as an Oireachtas committee.  I appreciate that this is the Deputy's first time here, and I do not say that to be rude.  Second, obviously, it is very important to listen to requests from Members of the Oireachtas, who reflect the views of the community, which the Deputy has just spoken about.  However, as regards powers, we have nil, other than to ask questions such as the Deputy is asking now and to get answers.  The other important thing is that this is perhaps a textbook example of how not to do things.

I know the MetroLink document is only a summary.  If we look at page 25, we see what TII and the NTA envisaged as the issues and challenges.  They outline six of them.  The sports clubs, the schools and the local community are not referred to.  Heritage is mentioned very briefly, but they envisaged no impact on the local community in part 6 of this document, \"Issues and Challenges\".  It says a lot to me that when they put this line together, no one looked and said, \"Jesus, look where it is going.\"  TII's and the NTA's issues and challenges are property acquisition; upgrading the existing green line; scheme traffic management; noise, vibration and ground settlement; materials and recycling; and cultural heritage.  They need to address this strongly.  I do take heart - and perhaps the members could clarify this - from the language in the report, such as \"emerging preferred route\".  It is therefore not a final preferred route, and I hope the community can take some solace from that.  What kind of alternatives are in place?<\/p> <p>  I was taken by all the submissions.  TII and the NTA now have them, as does this committee.  They are powerful testimonies.  I do not want to highlight one above the other, but there were a few matters raised in the ACA contribution from Anu Meehan.  I hope TII and the NTA will be flexible enough to take on board Ms Meehan's comments on the public consultation: \"The period from the opening of the public consultation ... to the submission date of 11 May 2018 is extremely short for ordinary citizens affected by this to comprehend the complexities of the work ..., which took years to complete with experts and a large budget.\"  What we have here are volunteers.<\/p><p>In fact, we have school principals who have much better things to do.  Members of the committee can see the anxiety this is causing them from a future perspective.  The time of those involved with sports clubs would be much better spent in dealing with the kids in their charge.  They have had to employ professionals.  The clubs are run on the money they raise through fundraising.<\/p><p> As Ms Meehan said, the NTA and TII are backed by a phalanx of professionals.  They have dedicated employees who deal exclusively with this matter.  They are up against ordinary citizens who have limited energy to give to this matter.  Like the Chairman, I have seen this happen many times in projects of this nature.  Volunteers can deal with one wave of activity of this nature, but it is extremely taxing for them to deal with big State organisations when they come wave after wave.  That point is made in a paragraph in the document to which I have referred.<\/p><p> Ms Meehan made the point that the public consultation process should be extended.  Those involved are not looking for a mad extension.  The organisations need hand-holding by experts in the NTA and TII.  Ms Meehan made another telling contribution when she said the website and the documents were sending confusing messages on a number of issues.<\/p><p> I assure everybody represented here that he or she will receive any assistance he or she needs from his or her public representatives.  My party leader has visited the local area.  I am happy to visit any of the schools and the site in question.  I have been in contact with two public representatives, Councillors Paul McAuliffe and Mary Fitzpatrick.  It has been clarified that the committee does not have statutory status in dealing with this issue.  What alternatives are being considered?  Any alternative will also have an impact, given that there is no action without an equal and opposite reaction.<\/p><p> I say to the representatives of the NTA and TII that a focus on public consultation and communications ought to be a huge part of what they do in the next decade.  It would not cost a lot of money.  I went to the Conrad Hotel for the launch of the project.  It is not right that a huge number of people at the heart of the community found out about it when they heard rumours or read about it in the media.  It seems that communication is not considered to be one of the priority challenges of the NTA and TII.  I suggest it is possible that it will be one of the greatest challenges they face.

He said that in normal circumstances it should be completed in three years.  Na Fianna has been told that it will have no facilities for six or seven years.  It seems TII is proposing to cut between 5 ft and 6 ft of tunnel per day over a period of six to seven years.  Will the officials from TII explain how it could take six or seven years to cut the tunnel for the metro, bearing in mind the average daily cutting rate to which I have referred?<\/p> <p>  I would like to refer to something else that was mentioned in the article in question.  The delegates can dispute these quotes if they wish.  They reflect the concerns that have been raised in the presentations.  According to the article, an engineer from the NTA or TII has said the proposal to dump on Na Fianna's ground was \"not the best\" plan.  The same engineer described the plan as \"crazy\".  We know the history of projects that have gone AWOL, with massive overspends, huge delays and all of the disasters involved.  The serious concerns that have been expressed are understandable in that context.  The engineer quoted in the article has said there is no need for a building depot and suggested the site earmarked for metro stops could be used to store kit and dirt and all that sort of thing.  He said there was no need to use Na Fianna's ground at all.  I wonder whether it was chosen by the consultants for pure convenience without giving due consideration to everyone who would be affected.  Will the delegates from the NTA confirm that it was done for reasons of pure convenience?  Did nobody in the NTA or TII think to question it, or just to look at it, before bulldozing ahead and announcing it?<\/p> <p>  A previous speaker asked about the alternatives being considered.  I want to ask about something relevant that struck me as I was listening to the presentations made.  People have huge concerns.  It comes back to the six or seven-year timeframe for tunnelling for the metro.  Why did it take so long to lay the tracks for the Luas cross-city line?  Was the NTA happy with the Luas cross-city project?  If the answer to that question is yes, I despair for the MetroLink project.  Most people would do likewise.  One will never learn if one is not prepared to honestly accept and openly acknowledge that one has made mistakes.  I am interested in hearing the NTA officials' response to that question.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by asking about the tendering process for the overall project.  How exactly will it work?  Will it be a full PPP or funded by the State?  I ask these questions in the light of the history of overspends, gross delays and general chaos in PPP projects.  When the State takes on these mass infrastructural projects, they tend to result in the overspend of hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#J00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1604,"content":"<p>Glaoim anois ar an Seanad&oacute;ir P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#J00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil me f&iacute;or-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il bheith mar &Eacute;ireannach tar &eacute;is dom &eacute;isteacht leis an gcur i l&aacute;thair a rinne Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, Michael Dowling, Marcella Nic Niallaigh agus Carmel de Grae.

I heard of Home Farm a long time ago because many lads and girls who grew up playing for the club represented the country and went on to play for clubs like Manchester United.  Home Farm is even known in Connemara for what it does, agus n&aacute;r laga Dia iad.  My background is very much in the GAA space.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Meehan made the very good suggestion that the public consultation process be extended because many believe they did not have a proper chance to engage.  Will the delegates confirm that it is possible to extend the consultation process to give people a reasonable amount of time to engage?  I plead with them not to go ahead with plan A in its current format.<\/p><p>I looked up statistics from the Central Statistics Office on the population in the Glasnevin-Drumcondra-Mobhi Road, general Phibsboro and Ballymun area, that Na Fianna club covers.  One is talking of the region of 200,000 people.  That is more than the population of County Mayo, and there is only one football pitch.  Imagine that for the whole population of Mayo.  The biggest challenge in Dublin is that there are not enough facilities for young people to go out and enjoy themselves.  Only for the volunteerism of those people, our education system would break down, and I am say that with huge respect for our teachers.  I was a teacher myself.  The greatest impact on my life was not entrepreneurship or anything like that but the classroom.  I would say to not only listen but to enable those communities that are here and are fully engaged.<\/p><p> I suggest that the Chair, on behalf of the committee, takes up the offer to visit the facilities and meet the people there.

This is a very worthwhile session but the fact the schools were not included initially speaks volumes about the approach of some agencies to this whole issue, and I will talk about that a bit more in a moment.<\/p> <p>  As a local public representative in the Glasnevin-Whitehall-Drumcondra area for some time, I have been very closely involved with the previous two iterations of metro and I was somewhat taken aback when on 22 March, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, announced this new route upon which there had been no consultation, no engagement whatsoever with public representatives in the local area and no engagement directly with public representatives since 22 March.<\/p> <p>  I, like others, went along to the public consultation sessions but the least the witnesses could have been done would have been to brief the public representatives in the areas directly affected.  That was a mistake on their part and I am concerned that it indicates a generally flippant attitude to local interests in terms of the need for good engagement and consultation.<\/p> <p>  It is noteworthy that all the groups that presented today made it very clear that they are fully supportive of the metro project.  They believe that it is a very positive thing for Dublin and for the northside, in particular, and that they are not objecting to it.  That is an important statement to make.  What they are obviously concerned about are the implications of different aspects of this major project.  Everybody accepts that in a major infrastructural project, there is always collateral damage.  There are downsides to any big positive.  Sometimes the collateral damage or the price paid is simply too high, and that is certainly the case in this instance.  I am increasingly concerned that there was a complete lack of awareness and appreciation of the area that would be affected by the proposal, the general campus of Na Fianna, as well as the associated activities that go on around it.<\/p> <p>  To a large extent, it is hard to think of a more sensitive area on the north side of Dublin than this particular campus.  Several of the contributors referred to this as the heart of the community, and there is no question about that.  It is a sporting, educational, cultural and social campus.  I do not believe there was an appreciation of that on the part of TII because I cannot imagine that anybody who would be aware of the extent and diversity of the activities and the sensitivity of that site would come up with the proposal that would have such a hugely negative impact on the site for six or seven years.<\/p> <p>  I was quite taken aback by the opening comments of Mr. Nolan in regard to this whole issue.  He spoke of TII being in negotiations and engaging with both clubs.  This is not a case of simply both clubs.  The impact obviously on both clubs is enormous and could sound the death knell for at least one of those clubs.  This is not simply about finding alternative pitches for a couple of clubs.  It is a much wider issue than that.  I do not sense any appreciation from TII of the scale of this being so big in respect of four educational institutions associated with that site.  I include in that Whitehall College of Further Education as well as the na&iacute;onra, Scoil Mobh&iacute; and Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona.<\/p> <p>  It is all very well to look at this from a theoretical point of view and to talk about a period of six or seven years.  The reality is that six or seven years represents practically the entire primary school career of a child.  That could be wiped out.  It also represents the entire secondary school career of a child but there does not seem to be any recognition of that whatsoever.  It is impossible to think how one could proceed with the scale of the construction works at this site, including the launch pad for the tunnel boring machines plus the construction of a station that would take six to seven years to complete, without having an appreciation of the massively detrimental impact that will have on the 1,000 children attending those educational facilities.<\/p> <p>  One has a situation that is extremely sensitive.  There is a movement of 1,000 young people twice daily from that entire site.  When one adds in parents, teachers and staff, one is talking about the movement of 2,000 people twice every day beside a major construction site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#K00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1609,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an t-am istigh anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#K00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1610,"content":"<p>It is impossible to see how one could have considered that as a viable or feasible option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#K00500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1611,"content":"<p>Glaoim an Seanad&oacute;ir John O'Mahony anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#K00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1612,"content":"<p>Can I ask some quick questions, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#K00700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1613,"content":"<p>I try to be fair to everybody.

That is the purpose for which anything is done.<\/p><p> On a couple of specific issues - I will defer to the local people and local public representatives involved - mention was made of extending the consultation period.  The probable difficulty with that is that this would extend the uncertainty that is there already.  I am not sure how that would work.  After the public consultation on 11 May 2018, if there is a deviation from what is already proposed, then will there be public consultation on that as well?  I presume there would need to be, and that may be the way to proceed.  <\/p><p> A knocking together of heads is needed to serve the people of this community and also to provide them with the most up to date system of public transport; that is the key to it.

I welcome all the representatives of the State agencies and of the community groups here today.  My initial response is that this a very exciting project and hugely important for the city for lots of reasons.  It is good to note that there is a positive acceptance and a welcome for it despite the serious concerns people have.  If anyone is listening in on live TV from rural Ireland they are probably flabbergasted at the size of this budget.  It is a &euro;3 billion estimate, and we know the nature of estimates, to provide 15 new railway stations and 3,000 additional park and ride spaces.  One will be able to get from the north of Dublin down to Sandyford in 50 minutes.  It took me six years before I could get a lift across the railway station in Charleville.  This is not about the woes of rural Ireland but this example may put it into perspective.<\/p> <p>  It is a very familiar story.  We have a major project, with big budgets for the overall good of a region, side by side with the legitimate concerns of a local community who very often find themselves frightened, defenceless and bewildered by what is going on around them.  We have heard of how difficult it has been for the representatives to access information.  That worries me.  I have to say, and I am reluctant to be critical of State agencies, but I am a bit underwhelmed by the level of approach and contact and interaction that has been taking place to date.  <\/p> <p>  How advanced is this preferred route?  Let us come clean about this, are these agencies open for serious and meaningful change, in consultation with the groups that are here today?  If the agencies are not, we might as well know about it and people might have to look at alternative ways forward.  I always believe in dialogue and I would hope that what the presenters of this programme have said is true, and that they are open to and do want to talk, and want a meaningful interchange with the public.  Otherwise this is a waste of time.  I hope it is not written in stone.  I suspect it is not, it is too big a project for that.<\/p> <p>  I really was impressed by the presentations made here today, a Chathaoirligh.  I would be very familiar with Na Fianna; as a Kerryman we try to keep as good an eye as we can on the enemy.  We know how all of the good Dublin clubs are progressing.  I have tremendous time for Home Farm FC also.  I know the area fairly well, having spent two years in the teacher training college in Drumcondra.  I was particularly impressed by the contribution of Ms Meehan representing the residents' group, because it is a very special place.  It is a quiet oasis, Glasnevin, with the Botanic Gardens, the graveyard and the canal.  It is very special place with a particular history not just for the region but for the country.  Ms Meehan makes a very strong case which I hope will be listened to.  <\/p> <p>  My party leader has visited the area and taken an interest in this; he has appointed Deputy Lahart with a special remit for the Dublin area, and along with our local representatives, Councillor Paul Mc Auliffe and Mary Fitzpatrick, we have all been fairly well briefed on our side of the House and we are very much on the side of the community.<\/p> <p>  I do hope that the big body, which in this case is the developers, is prepared at this stage to get into serious discussions with the sports clubs, agus go h&aacute;irithe leis na scoileanna, mar treasla&iacute;m d&oacute;ibh as ucht an ch&aacute;is ina bhfuil siad agus an c&aacute;s a chuir siad romhainn inniu.

One of the balances that is not here is the balance of the community versus the semi-State or the State organisation, particularly in terms of funding and access to professional legal and planning advice.  This is something that is not going to end today.  There ought to be a mechanism where one can access an independent fund or independent legal advice that one can commission but will be paid for from that fund, that would meet certain standards, and would not and could not be anything other than what one would need.  That would certainly ensure that the community case that the witnesses have articulated so clearly and strongly is backed up professionally because when these issue move on into planning fora and such bodies, this support is required.  I remember an experience when a number of us opposed an incinerator in our community.  When it came to the planning stage, we had our own people there as we had no money to pay anybody.  All of the other parties had a bevy of lawyers and solicitors and planners.  We won the argument at the end of the day.  It was a huge battle, however, and it is a huge battle to try to get equality for one's community.  There is a balance nationally that we ought to address in that regard.

I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt do gach duine a  th&aacute;inig anseo inniu agus an imn&iacute; a thaispe&aacute;in sibh go l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn.  T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in i bhfabhar metro ach go h&aacute;irithe t&aacute;imid an-bhuartha mar gheall ar an bplean su&iacute;omh Mobhi a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus na himpleachta&iacute; at&aacute; leis sin.  First, I thank everyone for coming.  This discussion was very valuable and is badly needed.  When I was over in the Conrad Hotel at the consultation and I was talking to Mr. Creegan who was outlining the plan, the first thing that struck me was the Brian Boru issue about taking down or compulsorily purchasing the Brian Boru, Kelly's Carpets and the apartments there and the implications that would have.  Whatever the implications that action would have, the residents have a lot to say about this issue and they will make their views known.<\/p> <p>  The first thing that really struck me was when he started describing the plans for Na Fianna grounds and Home Farm FC's grounds.  I said to him straight away, and he will remember this, \"that is not going to happen, that is not going to work\".<\/p><p>I could not see any logic in it.  I could not see any logic in destroying a whole community, which is what it would do, for six or seven years.  If all that machinery and those works were to be put on that land, the club and a whole generation would be destroyed.  Thousands of people use that area weekly.  Moreover, the traffic on Mobhi Road is massive and is chock-a-block daily because I use it myself coming into Leinster House so I know what it is like.  I go back to all the consultations we had with the metro north.  I must have been at about 30 of them going back to 2010 or 2011, when it was scrapped.  Millions was spent on the whole consultation.  I never saw a full figure but it was very substantial.  Then the plans changed whereby Drumcondra has been excluded and now we are going through Glasnevin.  Whatever the reasons were for that are among the things we need to tease out.  Why did this happen?  I do not know what lessons we have learned from the previous consultations but we certainly need to consult with people.  We must go to the ends of the earth in consulting with the clubs etc.  I believe we have to look at alternatives and I do not think there is any way about it.  Originally the plan was Albert College.  I am not saying that is the right thing to do but originally that was the plan.  We would operate from Albert College.  How we got down to Na Fianna is still baffling.  What is the problem about going to the north of Ballymun, up towards the airport, where there are virgin lands.  The operation could be done from there.  There might be engineering issues posed and it probably would be a little more difficult but it is not impossible that the work could be done from those lands.  I know it was said that we do not want to discuss options but this is about options because the people here are clearly indicating they will not accept this.  There are obviously concerns for other residents as to where tunnels will go under their properties etc  and how that will be handled will all have to be addressed.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il and have been consulting with Deputy McDonald on what is going on and we both are in agreement that this site simply is not acceptable.<\/p><p> I know the Irish schools that are there.  The three main schools; Scoil Mobh&iacute;, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona and the other college there will be absolutely decimated by this.  I cannot get my head around the logic and how this idea was come up with to go on that site.  I am still baffled by this.  There are things we need to know.  We need to know whether a traffic management plan has been put in place?  Have we done an environmental impact statement, EIS, or are we about to do an EIS because the effects this will have are massive?  I would have expected that something will be outlined on when an EIS would be done on this site.  This term \"the emerging preferred route\", is one I always worry about because it tends to focus people into an area instead of giving them solutions.  That is what seems to be happening.  We seem to be focused on this being the only solution, that is, we operate from somewhere within the Glasnevin area and it is more convenient.  My take on it from talking to people is that it is much easier to operate from the centre and work both sides and that is what the idea here is.  That is why I have suggested that we should be looking north of Ballymun to see whether this would be suitable.  I believe it can be done.  We all know the benefits of a metro.  People here are not saying they are against a metro but they are certainly not going to take it at any cost or at any cost to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#L00500","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1625,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis made some very important points there.

In terms of our opening statements, we addressed the sporting facilities because we were unaware that the representatives for the schools and residents were going to present.

We do not underestimate the concerns of those groups who are represented here today.

His first question was if we would commit to announcing changes as soon as possible after the consultation ends.  The answer is \"Yes\".  It will take us a little bit of time to absorb all of the feedback because many issues are involved, not just the issues that have been mentioned here but many other issues as well.  It will be as soon as practicable after the end of that work.  We are conscious that people would like certainty and TII and ourselves will try to make an announcement as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there were implications if the tunnel boring launch moved to a different location.  The short answer is that there are implications, such as cost.  Every time one makes a change, it has a cost implication.  We are conscious of the fact that we have a certain allocation of money from the Government.  The sum is very significant but we must still deliver the project within budget.  There may be time implications or implications on residents and other things nearby.  It would all be about the specifics. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the number of truck movements.  We have not reached the stage of assessing individual truck movements.  A couple of people have provided information from the previous metro north project.  We would say that is probably in the right order but we have not reached the stage in the project where we have detailed information because, as we have said, we are at the emerging preferred route stage.<\/p><p>A human health assessment has not been undertaken as of yet, but the Deputy is absolutely right that it has to be done.  It is usually done as part of what used to be called an environmental impact statement but is now called an environmental impact assessment report.  At that stage it would have to be undertaken.  The other queries about consultation will be dealt with by Mr. Nolan.<\/p><p> Deputy Lahart raised a number of questions.  One of points he made was that we did not highlight the sports ground among the issues and challenges in the document.  He is perfectly right about that.  We thought we had included it under property acquisition.  It arises out of the temporary acquisition of the site and we thought we had covered it but obviously we were not clear enough.  The Deputy asked us what alternatives had been considered.  There is a document available for download on the MetroLink site, which shows all of the alternatives that were gone through.  I would say that all in all we probably looked at more than 100 alternatives for the scheme and teased through each of them one by one to try to work out the best option to bring forward at this stage.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster asked about the rate of boring advancement and spoke about her American colleague who gave her some information.  We have given a time range, which is probably the worst case scenario, and we are right to give the worst case scenario.  If we were to sugar coat it and say it was less than that people would rightly be concerned.  Whatever rate is technically possible, and I do not think it is as fast as the rate quoted by Deputy Munster, is the rate the tunnel will advance at each day.  I do not think tunnels of this size would get up to that particular rate of advancement.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked whether this would be a public private partnership or an Exchequer-funded scheme.  We are operating on the basis the Government is allocating funding from Exchequer resources, but I am conscious the national development finance agency has a part to play later in advising whether this is the right decision.  We are advancing on the basis that is Exchequer funded and not a public private partnership, but this will be concluded later.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster also asked why it took so long to lay the tracks for the Luas cross city.  I realise it is a different project but her point was whether we learned any lessons from it.  The Luas cross city took as long as it did because we were being very careful going through the city centre of Dublin, where traders were expressing their views to us that they were struggling from a retail activity point of view and needed us not to shut down the streets fully in the way we might like in order to do it expeditiously.  We had very close engagement with the TII and the traders for several years and did the scheme in a way that kept businesses operational and functioning.  It might not have been the fastest way to do it, but had we done it the fastest way it is not what they would have appreciated or wanted.<\/p><p> Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned extending the public consultation process and he was quite passionate about it.  This issue with this was raised elsewhere, which is the longer it is extended the longer there is uncertainty.  We will take that away and consider what is the right thing to do.  There are pluses and minuses as we can see.<\/p><p> Deputy Shortall had a number of queries.  One was about a briefing for public representatives.  We are conscious we tried to do that on the day of launch, when we organised a briefing session for all of the public representatives.  That is what we tried to do at that stage.  The Deputy also asked how many alternative sites we had examined for Glasnevin.  We have not looked up the exact number but we looked at a myriad of station locations in that general area.  They are all in the document.  In terms of alternatives, we looked at more than 100 alternatives for the overall project.  With regard to sites for specific stations we looked at tens of alternatives in each case.  There are also issues which Mr. Nolan will cover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524659400,"counter":1631,"content":"<p>We welcome this engagement.

Engagement started a few weeks ago and we give a full commitment from the NTA side and the TII side to continuous engagement over the coming weeks and after the closing of the public consultation stage.  With regard to public consultation, as Ms Graham said, it is an emerging preferred route so it is fluid to some extent.  There will be more opportunities for public consultation.  There will be a six-week statutory public consultation stage once we published the railway order.

As Ms Graham said earlier, we were informed that today we would deal with the impact of MetroLink on recreational facilities, and we were unaware the schools would be here.

We have met in this committee before and the committee and I are very appreciative of their efforts and commitment.  Everybody here has mentioned the schools, Home Farm and Na Fianna.  There is strong support for metro north.  We all believe that is the way to go.  Dublin is the only capital city in Europe in which there is no train link to the airport whatsoever.  It has to be done.  I did a little research on this and the Government was first speaking about this back in 2005.  As Deputy Ellis stated, he is aware of 30 or more consultations on this and God knows how much it cost.  I am sure it cost millions.  I suggest that extending the time would be helpful but extending time must be ring-fenced.  It has to be stated that an extra two weeks, four weeks or whatever will be given.  That would mean an awful lot to the communities and the sporting organisations to give them a chance to get their thoughts together.

While I have not had the chance to go through the website in detail, was consideration given to having more above ground, rather than boring down underneath in particular areas?  Alternatively, in the UK and other countries, there is a tier process.  It could be much higher than road level, for example.

It was mentioned in the response that multiple alternatives were looked at.  One hundred different alternatives were mentioned, as were tens of alternative specific sites.  Given this location is the one that is selected for entry under the ground essentially, did it raise any red flags when it was examined?  That is the first question.

The groups should keep compiling the questions and if they run up against a road block, their public representatives are here to help them.  I would, however, try to adopt an open door here.  No one wants this scheme delayed.  It is an ambitious timeline, given my experience of other infrastructural projects.  Were alternative sites looked at for the planned entry underground?

I would appreciate a firm date or timeframe on that commitment because while \"as soon as is practicable\" sounds good in this room, on leaving this room it will be scant consolation to the parents on 30 April, for example, when the school is having their parents' night.  It is scant consolation in terms of enrolments and the knock-on effect due to people choosing not to enrol their children in the school and so on.  I would appreciate it if a firmer timeframe could be put on that.  There may be a few outstanding questions but I refer to achieving the engineering objectives with regard to the radius from the proposed boring site.<\/p><p>In effect, my question is the same as that asked by Deputy Ellis, albeit phrased slightly differently.  How far north or south can one go from the proposed boring site without undoing the engineering objectives?

I presume it is not possible to go beyond a certain radius as otherwise there would be no point in having a median boring site.

How much more starkly can we spell out to them that the current plan and configuration are simply not acceptable to the local community and the other interests represented today, including public representatives?  It is not good enough to state that the NTA and TII will not move on to the statutory process.  We all know what this means.  Once a project proceeds to the statutory process, it is essentially set in stone and it becomes extremely difficult to reverse it at that point because the costs involved would usually be prohibitive.  If the NTA and TII are serious about public consultation, they will listen to what members of the public in the greater Glasnevin area.  Public consultation does not mean telling people what one is planning to do but listening to what they have to say.  I have not had any indication from either of the two agencies that they have heard what we are saying.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in hearing from the NTA and TII about their assessments of the alternative options.  Can they provide an assurance that they examined other options and have found these to be feasible?  While none of these may be the preferred option, are there other feasible options that will address the serious concerns raised?  It is important that we have that information.  Let us stop fooling each other about this issue.  We do not want this project to proceed as currently proposed.  What can the agencies do to respond to the very serious concerns expressed about it?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the schools, time is of the essence because this is a particularly difficult and sensitive time of the year.  We heard that key decisions are being taken about the schools to which parents will send their children from next September onwards.  The confidence of parents has already been knocked in respect of the two affected schools and the Nao&iacute;nra.  Given that there is no time to waste in this regard, the NTA and TII must issue a response on the matter at an early stage.<\/p> <p>  This has been a worthwhile session and I hope both agencies will give consideration to all the concerns raised today and appear again at an early date.  While different approaches to addressing this matter are available, the joint committee, as a formal forum, is good way to address this issue.  It allows all the different interests to be represented in one room and all members can hear the same story.  This is very important and I ask the agencies not to attempt to fob us off by arguing there is a statutory process under way and people can submit their views to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That argument is of no use to us.<\/p> <p>  I ask the NTA and TII to make a commitment to appear again at an early stage and give a clear indication to the joint committee that they have heard what members and witnesses have said today.  I hope the penny has dropped to the effect that we do not believe the proposal is acceptable in its current form.

I will make a point arising from Deputy Lahart's contribution.  Given that the cost of MetroLink will be &euro;3 billion, I do not see any reason the community should not benefit from professional advice, by which I do not mean legal or planning advice but rather technical and engineering support.  This would enable members of the public to gain an understanding of what is proposed.  The affected schools and the GAA and soccer clubs are community organisations, rather than vested interests or property owners in the traditional sense.  They do not have anything to lose and the State would not lose if it were to seek to ensure that they were as satisfied as could be reasonable possible with what was being proposed.  For this reason, the local community should have access to the types of independent advice I described.  They would then have facts about which they are not aware and would gain insights.<\/p> <p>  I fully support infrastructure projects that work, which includes working with the community.  Instead of placing their consultation notes at the back of a document, the agencies should place them on the front page.  People would then view the project as one from they would greatly benefit, rather than as a TII or Government project.  Having ownership of the process and access to advice would be good thing and would cost little in the context of the overall cost.  Nobody would  lose and people would be better informed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#R00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1660,"content":"<p>One of the issues that annoyed me and, I assume, many residents and groups was that reference was made to the emerging preferred site before the consultation had even begun.  That was hard to swallow.<\/p> <p>  I made suggestions with regard to options.  The location of the boring machine, whether it is double or single bore, can make a big difference.  I am curious as to whether the NTA and TII considered the idea of having separate compounds, with the boring machinery located in one compound and other complementary works done elsewhere.  Would that offer some leeway or scope for considering different areas as options?<\/p> <p>  We heard that alternative sites would not be discussed.  It is clear from the community, including sports clubs, schools and local people in general, that the proposed route will not be accepted.  We cannot adopt an approach of using compulsory purchase orders or railway procurement orders to railroad this project through against the wishes of the community.  I am fully in favour of MetroLink but not at any cost.  It would not be acceptable if the cost was the destruction of communities.<\/p> <p>  I asked about the environmental impact statement.  Did it examine the effects of the project on local communities?  Did someone consider what is happening to the community?  Has a report been done on this issue?  This would have been the first thing I would have done.  I hope most of the underground route will be bored under roads, rather than houses.  One would have expected work on these issues and the effects of the project on communities to have been done.<\/p> <p>  When a metro route through Ballymun was planned, the local authority imposed fees on every planning application in the area.

We are absolutely delighted that the committee has decided to accept the invitation to come and join us on site.  It is an opportunity for us to explain why referring to Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna as a sports club does it a disservice.  We see ourselves as a very strong, vibrant and unique urban Gaelic community.  Our reach and community impact is far greater than just the field of play, although we would like to think much of our reputation comes from there.<\/p> <p>  There are many lessons to be learned from the public consultation process to which we have been exposed and which we have experienced to date.  As a community and voluntary organisation, we find it a little bewildering that the State has spent more than &euro;180 million on a project to date and that, despite that level of funding, it fell upon us as a community volunteer organisation to inform our nearest neighbours and educational institutions of the plans.  We also find it somewhat bewildering that we had less than 48 hours notice before the public announcement was made when, as a community organisation, we are likely to receive the most discomfort or discommoding from the transport infrastructure project.  Again we will emphasise what all of the groups here have said; we are supportive of improvements to our public transport infrastructure and think it is important to maintain it.<\/p> <p>  On the wider public consultation process, we hear with interest today that 3,000 people have engaged in the process.  To our knowledge, approximately 2,000 of those have been members of our organisation.  That would imply that only another 1,000 individual members of the public have engaged in that consultation.  We feel that is perhaps an issue which should be of greater concern to this committee and the organisers of the public consultation.  <\/p> <p>  We have heard much about principles of consultation and engagement.  Since the beginning of this process we have made three requests.  We requested to attend the launch at Conrad Dublin and that request was refused.  When we first heard about the public consultation period we asked if it could be extended because it was so brief.  That request was refused.  As the Cathaoirleach has suggested, we asked that, in light of the fact that we are a voluntary organisation, we be supplied with some resource or assistance in independently assessing the plans which the State presented to us and on which it has spent a budget of &euro;180 million.  We were refused.  We have been refused all three aspects of the practical support and assistance we have asked for to date.  Notwithstanding that, we are still positively disposed to engaging in this process.  <\/p> <p>  On the point Deputy Lahart made in respect of public transport that eggs must be broken in order to make omelettes, we appreciate that our community may suffer some discomfort but we do not believe that this must be progressed at any cost.  We do not believe that we should know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  Deputy Lahart spoke about community and volunteer organisations and how, when they come into contact with such statutory bodies and large projects, after the first wave of response the enthusiasm and energy of such organisations are quite often broken down.  I assure the committee on behalf of our members that Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael Na Fianna has faced wave upon wave, indeed a tsunami, of globalisation and other challenges in our existence in north Dublin and our community is ready to face more to ensure that we continue to exist and deliver for the benefit of our people and our community within North Dublin.  We will continue to do that whatever it takes.

That passion is shared by all of our community representatives and by committee members who are here today.  Our club is one of the largest in Europe.  Our community is one of the largest in Europe and is unique.  In a community of that size it is very difficult to stay galvanised and united around a common purpose.  Heretofore, we thought that Na Fianna had achieved that, but little did we know that the impact of this project, as Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; has said, would be to galvanise us further.  In terms of lessons learned on public infrastructure projects, it is absolutely clear that the balance of power, resources, information and money lies with the State.  Despite our best efforts and our early and ongoing consultation with TII, we have not met with an equal and appropriate response.  Since the beginning of this process some short weeks ago we have sought to comprehend the detail of what is the most ambitious infrastructure project the State has ever proposed.  We have used the voluntary resources of our club to try to make sense of it in a way which we could communicate to our large membership.  Apart from the 2,000 members who engaged in the consultations in The Helix and the other northside venues, we have had one information meeting with our members at which there was standing room only.  We had to look for larger and larger facilities and restrict the meeting to adults only, such was the weight of opinion and passion against this project.<\/p> <p>  As it stands, notwithstanding all of the obstacles and the lack of support we have received to date, we are prepared to believe in the integrity of the process.  We believe in the commitments which TII and the NTA have given us in terms of a timely response.  That tolerance and patience is, however, time-limited.  Unless we get clarity on the outcome of the review of public consultation in a timely manner, we will have to consider what is an appropriate response at that stage in the interests of all of our community members and in the belief that we have a responsibility to the founding members of Na Fianna and to the people of Glasnevin and Drumcondra to deliver a result which is in the best interests of all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Caffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1663,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their heartfelt words.

There were questions about alternative routes.  There is one report here but the maps in it and those which have been downloaded from the website are totally impossible to make out.  Even if one opens the maps on the web itself, one cannot make out where these lines and tunnels actually run.  I may be wrong, but my understanding is that using Drumcondra as a station is options 1 to 8 and using Whitworth's new station is options 9 and 10.  The reasoning weighing up Drumcondra versus Glasnevin is at options 7 and 9, respectively.  The only thing I can deduce from that is that the money is a drop in the ocean in comparison to &euro;3 billion and there would be a greater passenger experience if the option is to use Whitworth because it would be all new and there would be no need to work around the existing station at Drumcondra.  There would be a further distance to walk for passengers in Drumcondra.  As such, there would be a quicker transfer time in Whitworth.  However, my understanding is that Ireland is about to be the fattest nation in the European Union within a few years.  As such, it might be worth thinking about walking the passengers from one place to another as it may be only exercise they get all day.<\/p> <p>  We support the schools and clubs on the importance of the time restraints and we support the request for a speedy resolution.  We would like that too.  Drumcondra is already there and Whitworth is a whole new ballgame.  The other difference in outcomes was that Drumcondra would have fewer passengers.  However, it was a matter of a few thousand whereas the journey time would be two to three minutes extra.  Passengers would save two or three minutes if they were landing at Whitworth rather than Drumcondra, but in the overall scheme of things two to three minutes is not a great amount of time.  Another issue that arose for me was to do with the foundations in our architectural conservation area.  I went to the public consultation meeting in Glasnevin and spoke with five representatives of TII, not one of whom was able to tell me conclusively whether my house would remain standing as such.  One representative said: \"When the cracks appear, we will do something about it.\"  Another representative said \"of course, there are foundations under your house\" whereas another member of my community came over and noted that there were no foundations and the houses were built on clay and rubble.  It was very upsetting to be dismissed to that extent by people who do not know.  My house was built in 1850 and my parents moved into it as a newly wedded couple in 1900.  It has gone through our family.  My great grandfather was living in Prospect Avenue in 1830.  I know my house but I was dismissed as not knowing what I am talking about.  I have a fair idea of what I am talking about.<\/p> <p>  Rezoning is proposed for the area behind the Brian Boru, when demolished.  I understand that the land there belongs to the NTA.  Once the new station is put in place, the area behind it will be rezoned and built on.  At the moment, it cannot be rezoned for housing because there is no access to it.  That is a hidden agenda sitting there and waiting to happen.  Our whole community consists of 2,000 people in the architectural conservation area and on the Iona District Residents' Association.  Importantly, it is not just a small enclave, it is a much wider community.  Taking into consideration Iona and Lindsay Road, most of Iona was also developed without foundations.  All of these wonderful houses will be impacted by constant vibrations.  The trains will impact indirectly on their properties every two minutes and they will travel at 80 km\/h once they leave the station.  We will have trains travelling underneath our houses at 80 km\/h every two minutes for the rest of our lives.

My daughter will also be going to the school in the near future.  From a parent's point of view, I will have to take my kids out of the school if this goes ahead.  There is no way I could put them at risk.  When I was deciding what school they would go to when they were still babies, it was a long process.  I wanted them to have their education through Irish and took a long time to decide where to send them.  We have to make a trip to get there as their national school was in a football club, which was unsuitable, before being moved further out from the area.  I have to make that trip every day and committed to doing so because I want them to have the Irish language.  I did not have a great experience with Irish and I definitely did not want them to have that.  My husband and I made the decision to send them to that national school and, because we live locally, we decided Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona was the best fit.  It was the best decision we ever made for our two lads who are having a whale of a time, in particular my eldest who is in transition year and is off to Italy tonight.<\/p> <p>  The placing of a drilling site at Na Fianna, which my lads are also in, will destroy it and will also have a massive impact on their school.  There is no way the school will be able to operate.  One will not be able to open a window with the noise and dust and it will not be possible to have the kids cycling or walking unattended.  As a parents' committee, we have been fundraising for bike racks to encourage children and staff to cycle more because of the massive congestion out on Mobhi Road, which is awful and bumper to bumper on a daily basis.  I try to get my lads to cycle and they do it most days albeit, depending on their mood or the weather, they may walk or take the bus.  When they do, I have to tell them to use the path as the risk is unbelievable at the minute.  If one were to put that site there, we will have 100 trucks going in and out, spewing diesel.  Research has been done on that and An Taisce reports that 3,400 people died prematurely in 2013 due to air pollution.  TII now wants to add another 100 diesel trucks to a built-up area which is already suffering from air pollution.<\/p> <p>  There are very few green spaces on the northside of Dublin.  This is one massive one.  The site at Na Fianna is used to the maximum extent by schools, the club itself and other local groups.  Community groups use the clubhouse.  It is not like it is used for a few hours here and there.  The benefit it provides to the area is huge.  On the traffic, I note that there was an accident last week on Mobhi Road.  I have to go down Santry Avenue with my daughter and the traffic was backed up to the M50 exit at Ballymun.  That is how bad it is.  It is an absolute bottleneck.  It is maddening that we do not even have a proper bike lane on the road there, yet it is proposed to allow 100 trucks to use the road.  Placing a building site at Na Fianna flies in the face of current Government policy, which is all about a healthier Ireland.  Dublin City Council is promoting play here, there and everywhere.  There is no way that can happen if this goes ahead.  Under Healthy Ireland, we are dealing with an obesity crisis among our children and it is so unfair that they have to deal with this.<\/p><p>As members of the parents' committee, we are trying to work on that.  That would all stop if my children had to leave that school.  It would impact our family and lots of families.  It is not just that they go to school and can go somewhere else.  Our family life would be impacted because we want them to have the Irish language.  We want them to have the best start, as one does as a parent, and we want them to have the best future they can have.  That is not going to happen if this goes ahead.<\/p><p> To TII and NTA, I note this is a quality of life issue as well.  There are other alternatives that would not have the massive negative impact this would have on our community.  This is the future of a generation in north side Dublin.  It is not that unusual a project for these bodies - I am sure they do these projects all of the time - but this will have a massive impact on us.<\/p><p> For me, it is a waste of taxpayers' money to be conducting any more reports, consultations, meetings etc.  It is a waste of our precious time and that of the witnesses to be engaged in this.  They should look at all the evidence we have presented today and make the right decision, which is not to proceed with this development here because there are alternative sites.

There is one I wish to add in particular, and that is to Deputy Shortall for making the representations that brought about our invitation.<\/p> <p>  I have two substantive points to make but before I do, perhaps I can give a small bit of context.  I am the father of two boys.  The elder is in na&iacute;on&aacute;in shinsireach, senior infants, in Scoil Mobhi and the younger is at the na&iacute;onra T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g which is in the clubhouse of Na Fianna, and he will be going on to na ranganna s&oacute;isireacha in September.  All other things being equal, I would expect them to then go on to Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona.<\/p> <p>  They also attend the Na Fianna nursery every Saturday where also I do handball mentoring.  Put very simply, the vast majority of their waking hours are spent on this site and will be until they are 18 years of age.<\/p> <p>  There is a very popular phrase: short-term pain for long-term gain but the one sector of our society one cannot say that about is school-age children.  They get one shot at getting the education they need and getting the intellectual skills and the social skills to make everything else in their lives possible.  It is genuinely heartbreaking to see that threatened.  <\/p> <p>  The two substantive points I have are to echo what Ms de Grae said about public consultation being extended.  It is a generous offer but it really just means, as Mr. Nolan pointed out, an extension of uncertainty for the schools.  That does not mean, however, that we do not think there needs to be iterative stakeholder consultation.  There absolutely must be.  What do I mean by iterative stakeholder consultation?  It is not what we have had so far.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will have heard the responses to Deputy Rock's questions about whether the descriptions of the potential site that we have provided are accurate.  The committee will particularly have heard the first part of TII's answers which is that its representatives do not know because they have not looked at it.  <\/p> <p>  It is not the only thing they have not looked at.  They have not looked at the environmental constraints specific to the site.  I can say that with some assurance, because in the environmental constraints report, when they look at air quality, noise and dust and at vibration, they have done desktop studies of the entire study area of MetroLink, also known as Dublin, and have come to the non-startling conclusion that there are a lot of schools, hospitals, and other community facilities in Dublin.  That led to the conclusion that, for the purposes of deciding the emerging preferred route, they would not look at those factors, because wherever the route goes, it is going to have an environmental impact.  <\/p> <p>  That is fine to a point, but it is not fine when that leads to the decision to propose a tunnel boring launch site bounded in its perimeter by a na&iacute;onra, primary school and secondary school.  There should have been red flags but from what we have been provided with, there were not.  As I have read every page of the public consultation documentation, I am confident in being able to say that.<\/p> <p>  What is proper engagement?  It is identifying and telling us what the construction work will involve.  Second, it is to work with us to scope what are the environmental and cultural constraints on that site.  Third, if that remains the preferred option, it is to explain to us, only in headline terms, what are the mitigations that TII and NTA have in mind that will enable them to abate the nuisance of noise, dust and those factors and to ameliorate the health and safety concerns we have.  If TII and NTA are not doing that, they are not engaging in consultation in any meaningful sense.<\/p> <p>  The final point I want to make is that I was pleased to hear from both NTA and TII that they are keen to respond to our questions.  They are particularly keen because we sent them a letter with 35 questions on 9 April in which we gave them until 23 April to respond.  As they have not responded, I choose to be encouraged that we will be getting a response tomorrow.  I would be even more encouraged if NTA and TII could commit to, within the next 48 hours, providing responses to the questions they have had since 9 April.  We cannot write our submissions until we have some facts and at present, we do not have the facts we need to write our submissions.<\/p> <p>  We are grateful that they have sat down with us and have talked to us but we do not feel we have been given the information we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Hart"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>I will ask the NTA and the TII to respond.  I hope Home Farm wins its match, by the way.  I believe Mr. Hart has summarised it all there.<\/p><p>We must engage, listen and communicate and make it our metro.  That is the real message.  Nobody in this room at this moment sees it as their metro.  They see it as the metro as belonging to TII and NTA, and that is what is really wrong.  I would ask the witnesses from TII and NTA to respectfully respond to the questions and after that we will close the meeting.  We will arrange through our clerk that everybody will get a link to the transcript; we will have that meeting on site and then we will work out a timetable for a return visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#U00600","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524659400,"counter":1677,"content":"<p>I want to assure those here today and anyone listening to this broadcast that we are listening.  We are a body that tries to respond to those who who make submissions to us.  We are listening and we will respond where we can, wherever possible, to mitigate against the impact of what will be the preferred route.  Again I say this is an emerging preferred route.  We put forward what we feel was the optimum route, primarily from an engineering point of view, but it did raise flags.  Of course there are flags when one is putting a major construction project like this through a residential community and through facilities that support the community in Glasnevin and Drumcondra.<\/p> <p>  What we want to do now is to take the submissions, take what has been said here today, and give that consideration.  We will then come forward and have further meetings with the affected parties to see if we can put forward a preferred route that everyone can support.  We are not naive in that because we understand we are never going to be able solve everybody's problems, and there may not be a solution where everyone is going to be able to support us.  What we will try to do is to mitigate and provide a solution that most of the community can support.  <\/p> <p>  We were very careful in terms of our consultation.  The launch was a media launch to ensure that the media were informed about what the project was.  Any individual stakeholder that was going to be impacted directly by the proposed emerging preferred route received correspondence in advance of that.<\/p> <p>  We organised a consultation period specifically for public representatives on 22 April from 4 p.m. to 8.p.m. and a number of representatives did attend.  We will be happy to do more, and we certainly can do further briefings, if requested; we will be open to doing that at any stage.  We are always open to setting up further briefings, and of course if we are requested to attend any committee we will do so; we have never refused to attend this committee or any other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018042500002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1524659400,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>We found out about this development, like others, from a television report.
