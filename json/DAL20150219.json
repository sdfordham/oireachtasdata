I am pleased that the Government has been able to reopen Templemore training college and restart recruitment.  There are now 300 recruits in the college in Templemore.  This has proved possible because of the improved economic situation and been welcomed by everybody.<br\/><br\/>The strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 December 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 12,799.  There were also 1,124 Garda Reserve members, with a further 48 in training.  In addition, there was a significant increase in the number of civilian staff, as recommended in every report that has analysed the future role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The reports state there are tasks which are appropriate to civilians.  Just three weeks ago, 42 more civilians started work at Dublin Airport, replacing garda&iacute; who did the job previously.  <br\/><br\/>I am pleased to add that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, agreed to the resumption of Garda recruitment and, as I said, we now have 300 student garda&iacute; in training.  Sufficient garda&iacute; are needed to support the delivery of the policing service which the public expects and deserves.  This does mean that an appropriate level of Garda recruitment is needed, not simply to counter the effect of ongoing retirements but also to bring to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the energy and vitality of young recruits that are so important in the often physically demanding work of policing.  I remain in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on the exact timing of future intakes of Garda recruits.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about Garda strength.  Clearly, many factors impact on the appropriate optimum Garda strength.  They include the availability of a modern ICT infrastructure, an issue with which we are dealing effectively, and changes in organisation and work practices to maximise efficiency.  A key objective must be to ensure the best use of Garda resources, with which I am sure the Deputy would agree.  It has featured strongly in reports we have recently received from the Garda Inspectorate analysing the exact use of garda&iacute; and where they should be allocated.  The Garda Commissioner and management staff are examining these recommendations very carefully.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><br\/><br\/>As Deputies will be aware, this is against the wider backdrop of a significant programme of Garda reform already under way, including the forthcoming policing authority, and I look forward to their input into these issues in due course.<br\/><br\/>I fully support the important role of the Garda Reserve in the delivery of the policing service.  We are fortunate that over 1,000 members of the public, from all walks of life, have volunteered to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting the community.  We owe them a debt of gratitude.  I certainly want to see the most made of their talents and commitment and I am pleased that the Garda Commissioner is finalising arrangements to extend the powers and functions of Reserve members in order that they can make a greater contribution to policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900003#A00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424338200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am trying to establish what is the official number the Government wants to achieve for the strength of the force.

I received that information from the Minister in a reply to a parliamentary question.  In addition, a further 110 members are on incentivised career breaks.  The most significant resource An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs is manpower.  If it is deficient in manpower, it puts the entire system under pressure.  Some 113,500 bench warrants are outstanding.  The force falls behind in doing that type of work and significant issues can arise as a result.  I am, therefore, trying to establish what the Minister's number is for the Garda force.  What should the minimum level be?

I certainly believe the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can carry out their duties; it is an extremely capable and talented force.  The Garda Commissioner has said front-line Garda services will continue to be prioritised.

Many people are willing to give of their time to the Garda Reserve to augment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In general, however, members of the Garda Reserve do not see enough opportunities for progression into the main force.  The numbers in training in the college in Templemore who came from the Garda Reserve are quite small relative to the total intake.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated a review of the Garda Reserve had been undertaken in 2011 with a view to increasing its powers and duties.

To date, Revenue has initiated 33 investigations as a direct result of the data received.  As a result of these investigations, 20 settlement payments were made.

The Deputy will be aware from our previous discussions that the Commissioner already had underway a comprehensive review and strategic realignment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's capacity to deal with emerging and complex crimes, such as those coming under the GBFI's responsibility.  This review is ongoing and the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in regard to crime investigation generally are also of relevance in this respect.

The personnel strength of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is approximately 70.  All of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working in this area have the relevant expertise and are working closely with international colleagues, in Interpol and Europol, and are exchanging information and pursuing any instances where there is a crime, and bringing forward prosecutions wherever the evidence is there.

The Deputy spoke about the closure of the Garda station but garda&iacute; want to ensure there is the visibility through patrol cars and increased patrolling in the area, as well as increased engagement with the community.  As the Deputy knows, various Garda clinics have been open on a regular basis to his constituents since that decision was made.<\/p>  <p>  There is no evidence or specific information to suggest that criminals are targeting local businesses or residential areas in Stepaside.  I take the Deputy's point about an increase.  I want to reassure him that this is a high priority for the Garda in its work for this year.  We have seen reductions in the area the Deputy is speaking about, for example, in regard to serious assaults and a range of other issues, including violent crimes against citizens.  There are reductions in many areas.  We get these changing patterns in crime and the Garda has to respond to the particular spikes that emerge for a variety of reasons.  One I mentioned relates to the mobility of these gangs, namely, the number of extra patrol cars in the area following the investment by this Government in transport for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900005#C00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424339400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Minister is right that the gangs are very mobile.

This is the first Government to bring forward legislative proposals for changes in this area.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is bringing forward the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which was debated in the Seanad yesterday.  It will extend the licensing regime to cover the operations of remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries.  The activities of such operators can then be taxed.<\/p>  <p>  There is no provision in Irish law for the licensing of casinos.  Some 47 private member gaming clubs are registered with the Department under the provisions of section 109 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended.  The Department's anti-money laundering compliance unit conducts inspections of these premises to assess compliance with the 2010 Act.  It is understood some of these clubs offer casino-type games.<\/p>  <p>  Under the proposals set out, the Minister for Justice and Equality will assume a regulatory role for all forms of gambling, with the exception of the national lottery, on enactment of the Bill.  As its Title indicates, the aim of the Bill is to establish a system within which gambling can take place openly, fairly and in accordance with terms and conditions, in other words, within a controlled environment.  The Bill will operate on the basis that all gambling is illegal, unless it is of a type permitted by law and even if it is permitted, it may be carried on only if it is licensed and in compliance with terms and conditions attached to the licence.  The general scheme is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel awaiting drafting.  I cannot indicate precisely at this point when the Bill will be published.

When one factors in that the average profit per gaming machine is in the region of &euro;19,200 per annum, this means a turnover of approximately &euro;364 million is potentially untaxed.  It is a huge area in which there is a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Proposals have been made, of which I know the Minister is aware, and given to the Minister for Finance for the introduction of a number of interim measures in advance of publication of the gambling control Bill.

A large and growing section of the market is unregulated, with attendant risks to consumers and a loss to the Exchequer.  That is why we need new legislation and the Bill is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill which is going through the Houses deals with certain elements of betting.  We need more comprehensive legislation to deal with the points made by the Deputy.

The issue is receiving the attention of the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which work in close co-operation through the joint policing strategy and the North-South crime conferences which are held regularly.  I am very pleased to say co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been better.  Recently I met Theresa Villiers, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to discuss this and other issues and we both welcomed the fact that co-operation was so effective.  This co-operation is necessary to deal with the type of crimes about which the Deputy is asking.<\/p>  <p>  Just this month, as a result of a joint intelligence-led investigation, officers from Revenue's Customs service, supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and officers from Her Majesty's Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, supported by the PSNI, carried out searches in a number of premises along the Border in both jurisdictions.  As a result, seizures of cigarettes with a value of &euro;167,000 were made in this jurisdiction, together with the seizure of a tobacco processing plant, 2 million cigarettes and 12 tonnes of tobacco in Northern Ireland.  One can see the scale of the issue involved.  A significant oil laundering plant was uncovered in County Monaghan.  It had the capacity to launder an estimated 20 million litres of fuel per annum.  These are just some examples of what is being done by the enforcement agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling organised crime, in all its guises, is a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is reflected in the policing commitments for the year ahead.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a strong and productive relationship with the PSNI and takes actions to counter security and crime threats which face the island, including the activities of the organised criminal groups to which paramilitary groups are inextricably linked.  This is a very challenging criminal justice area which is getting focused attention, North and South, to deal with the issues.  A cross-Border policing strategy is in place to improve public safety and to disrupt this kind of criminal activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900006#D01400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424340600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>In April 2013, I made a speech in this House in which I referenced the presentation of Retail Excellence Ireland to the justice committee.

It also made the point that almost 25% of the cigarette market is sourced from the black market and 109 million illegal cigarettes with a value of &euro;45.9 million were seized.  It estimates the Exchequer loses &euro;861 million annually.  This is a real threat.  I wish to send two messages today.  The first is to business people who work with the criminal gangs and to people who purchase cigarettes on the black market.  We need the taxes on cigarettes for health services.

Some of the group's recommendations can be implemented in the short to medium term but others will require a more long-term approach.  As an initial step, last November - shortly after the report was published - I obtained permission from the Government to follow through with some very key recommendations.  These include bringing forward legislative proposals to establish the parole board on an independent statutory basis; preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy, including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences relating to drugs and other offences apply; preparing proposals for Government on legislating for the review's recommendation that courts should set out in writing their reasons for imposing custodial sentences; preparing proposals on the potential for increased use of earned remission; and pursuing options for an open prison for female offenders.  These are the first recommendations from the report of the review group with which we have chosen to proceed.  I am also establishing a group to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations in general, with representation from key stakeholders.  I recently appointed Dr. Mary Rogan - who was a member of the review group and is a former chairperson of the Irish Penal Reform Trust - to serve as the independent chair of the new group.  Dr. Rogan is an extremely competent person and I am sure her appointment will be widely welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of contraband, especially drugs, in our prisons continues to be a major challenge for the Irish Prison Service.  It is clear that this availability is a huge barrier to prisoner rehabilitation and reform.  The Irish Prison Service is currently examining a number of key measures relating to drugs, including the enhancement of existing search capabilities and procedures, the expansion of the canine unit, the introduction of a confidential telephone line by means of which information on drug trafficking into our prisons can be given in confidence and the introduction of new technologies to prevent mobile phone.  It is also considering measures to improve treatment in prison for drug addiction.  The head of the Irish Prison Service is very conscious of the challenges drugs pose.  Of course, those challenges must be faced by the criminal justice and prison systems in other jurisdictions.  We will continue our efforts, including by means of introducing new initiatives, to deal with this scourge in our prisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900008#F00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424341200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Does the Minister envisage a timeline regarding the implementation of measures to drastically reduce the availability of drugs to those in our prison system?

This issue is not dealt with casually within our prisons.  There are serious and ongoing efforts to interrupt any attempts to bring drugs into prisons, including Limerick, Mountjoy etc., and I am sure the Deputy is aware of them.  Every effort is made to deal with the new and ingenious ways people visiting prisons try to smuggle in drugs and the means by which those in prison try to obtain access to drugs.  This is a persistent issue in prisons in Ireland and internationally.

The confidential telephone line to which I referred earlier and which is similar to that used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will come into operation shortly.  I urge any person with useful information regarding the smuggling of drugs into prisons to use this service and assist the authorities in tackling this problem.

All of these initiatives will be put in place.  There was a reduction in the amount of drugs available in prisons in 2014.

Considerable concern has been expressed at the meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council where this item is top of the agenda for discussion in terms of security across Europe.  Hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight and some have returned and are radicalised.<br\/><br\/>These events show that all states must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism.  Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible, it is not assessed at present as likely and there is no specific information relating to threat to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in the light of the ongoing developments and is continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat. Of course, it has the full support of the Government in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Approximately 30 people of Irish origin have travelled to these areas.  We need to keep some perspective on this number.  There has been some distortion in regard to the analysis of this number which includes individuals who travelled to Libya, Tunisia and other Arab states to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring, which began in 2010.  Some of these individuals have returned and approximately three have died in the conflict. <br\/><br\/>There are a small number of people based here who support extremism and who would try to facilitate others to travel to conflict zones.  Their activities are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is very close co-operation with the security services in other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to ensuring the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all Stages in the Seanad.  The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to ten years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  It is expected that the Bill will be brought before the D&aacute;il shortly.<br\/><br\/>Any response to this issue must be proportionate to the level of the threat and multifaceted in approach.  Engagement with minority or at risk communities is essential.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive programme of community engagement with minority communities. The aim of these programmes is to build a sense of inclusiveness among minority communities and to address feelings of marginalisation to avoid providing fertile ground for radicalisation and those seeking to radicalise others. <br\/><br\/>The radicalising affect of online propaganda must also be dealt with.  Ireland, with its European counterparts, will also seek to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop further initiatives in this domain.  From the perspective of domestic terrorism, the ongoing threat from paramilitary groups remains a matter of the highest concern for the Government.  Garda actions to disrupt and prevent actions by paramilitary groups continue.  The Garda will continue to use all lawful means at its disposal to bear down on the paramilitaries and will continue to work very closely with its counterparts in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom to this end.  This excellent relationship between the Garda and the PSNI is key to security co-operation and it has consistently been emphasised by the two police chiefs as essential and successful.  This operational relationship is mirrored by ongoing contacts at ministerial and official level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900009#G00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1424341800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Will the Minister comment on her statement that she could never rule out the possibility of an attack but that it is not likely at present because her colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, said Ireland must remain on alert?

It is important to say the Act draws no distinction between online, print or broadcast media and provides for a number of remedies.  The primary relief under the Act is an award of damages with a jury deciding the amount to be awarded if the defamation action is successful.  Either nominal or compensatory damages can be awarded. Given the nature of online defamation, the priority for the plaintiff might be to have the defamatory statement removed. Under section 33 of the 2009 Act, a plaintiff may seek a court order prohibiting the publication or further publication of a defamatory statement.  Injunctions are an important remedy in responding to online defamation.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the print media are regulated by the independent Press Council of Ireland which was granted recognition under the Act.

People were particularly struck by the vicious assault perpetrated on the prison officers detailed to take him to that appointment.  Fianna F&aacute;il and everybody in the House want to condemn that attack and wish the prison officers who were subject to this assault a speedy recovery.  We also ask that the Irish Prison Service make every resource available to aid their proper recovery and welfare.<\/p>  <p>  What was of most concern to the public was that the person in question was a high profile prisoner who had previously escaped from a UK prison.  We now know from reports that the Irish Prison Service had previously requested armed escorts on a number of occasions when this prisoner was leaving prison to attend medical appointments, but that these requests were declined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This raises a number of serious questions, in particular about the level of Garda resources available and afforded to the Irish Prison Service for these escorts.  The incident also raises questions about the welfare of prison staff in terms of the equipment available to them such as stab vests, pepper spray and batons.  We have heard that the Prison Officers Association has sought the provision of this equipment.   There is also the wider question of the welfare of front-line emergency workers, including garda&iacute;, prison officers, nurses and doctors working in emergency departments and the fire service.<\/p>  <p>  Since the incident in question happened, a Garda investigation has been ongoing and the Irish Prison Service is also conducting an investigation.  Bearing in mind the past record of the individual concerned of escaping from custody, the public fails to understand the statement made by the Taoiseach yesterday that the failure to provide a Garda escort had nothing to do with cutbacks or a lack of resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Against the backdrop of that amazing statement by the Taoiseach yesterday and given the two investigations which are a work in progress - we know that the Taoiseach is not authoring these reports or carrying out the investigations - does the Minister agree with the Taoiseach's statement that this incident had nothing to do with a lack of Garda resources?

There was a further intake of 100 recruits in December and of another 100 last week.  They have brought the number of recruits in the Garda College to 300 and are a measure of the Government's commitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We are resourcing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring that both it and the Irish Prison Service are properly resourced.

We will see how well it stacks up alongside some of the party's other policies on the economy.  It appears now that the Sinn F&eacute;in approach to JobBridge generally is that it ought to be scrapped but I understand that the policy proposals published today make suggestions as to how it can be improved or replaced by something very similar.  I look forward to considering the Deputy's policy proposals.  I also recall that the Sinn F&eacute;in leader, Deputy Adams, tabled a parliamentary question asking for the JobBridge scheme to be extended to people who are not on the live register.  He did so, I would suggest, on the grounds that he knows, as do many others, that it has been a success.  Youth unemployment has fallen by a third since 2012.  Under the Pathways to Work strategy, a focused effort has been made to reduce youth unemployment.  We are also implementing the Youth Guarantee, having launched First Steps and JobsPlus Youth a fortnight ago.  That work is paying off and the facts are there to prove it; they are staring the Deputy in the face.  There has been a significant reduction in youth unemployment, from 31% in 2012 at the height of the crisis, to 21.6% at the end of 2014.  There have been 37,341 JobBridge placements to date and 6,172 people are currently on internships.<\/p>  <p>  There are two points about JobBridge that must be stressed, the first of which is the fact that the scheme is voluntary, both for the host organisation or employer and the individual intern.  Second, an individual must have been out of work for three of the previous six months in order to qualify.  Issues have been raised by the Deputy regarding the monitoring of JobBridge and his concerns in this regard are legitimate.  None of us wants to see an abuse of the JobBridge programme, least of all the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  If a complaint is made by an intern, employee or someone else, it is investigated and taken very seriously.  There have been almost 10,000 monitoring visits since JobBridge started.  Of these, 97.5% of internships visited were found to be satisfactory.  That means that over one in four placements was monitored.  It was not just a dip-in monitoring exercise, but was very extensive.  However, out of over 11,000 host organisations, only 44 have been banned indefinitely, while ten have been banned for a lesser period of time.  That represents 0.5% against a backdrop of thousands of monitoring visits.   Any individual who wishes to report a suspected abuse of the JobBridge scheme should contact the JobBridge team directly.  Deputies can see, from the figures I have given, that complaints are investigated and where a breach is found, severe action is taken.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme has been successful and it is right to quote the Indecon report in that regard, although Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh quoted selectively from it.  The aforementioned independent report found that 60% of those who took part were in employment within five months.<\/p><p>Many also go into further education, training, reskilling or schemes like community employment.  The evaluation also found that 96% of host organisations would recommend JobBridge to another employer and 89% of interns stated that JobBridge had given them new skills.  It is not a replacement for employment but it is something that can be of huge value in increasing people's self-confidence, giving them an opportunity to gain quality work experience and establish a network of contacts.  It is not a job but it takes people a long way along the road to achieving confidence in the market and the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900014#M03000","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424345100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Internships are not jobs yet the Minister tried to put it across as such.

Previously, this was carried out by civil servants and local authority workers and now it is being carried out by people on internships.  Real jobs are there, such as for retail assistants, that were entry-level jobs in the past.

This is epitomised by the low levels of investment and the high cost for parents.  Some 25,000 staff are employed, and in many cases they are on low wages and have temporary contracts.  Many engaged in child care services are earning little more than the minimum wage.  As a result, the services are losing qualified and experienced, professional people.  They can no longer afford to remain in the profession.  It is time the Government steps in, recognises and accepts that it has a responsibility to provide sufficient funding to ensure high quality and delivery of service is maintained.  There is an urgent need to raise the current level of spending on the early childhood care and education scheme from the current level, 0.2% of GDP, to the European average, 0.7% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  The people on the protest on Tuesday were not seeking that parents pay more, nor were they seeking to increase the strain on service providers.  Parents are paying as much as they can and service providers are already struggling to meet their staff costs, overheads and running costs.  Recognition must be given to the preschool stage as a critical and integral part of the delivery of early childhood services as part of educational services.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister and the Government address the following priorities?  There should be a national pay scale for childhood professionals tied to increased Government investment within three to five years.  The free preschool contract should be extended to statutory holiday entitlements and training days.  This will cease making seasonal workers out of qualified and experienced practitioners.  There should be increased availability and uptake of FETAC level 6 degrees and continual professional development courses and investment in the early baby stages for those aged up to three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900015#N01100","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1424345100,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Tom Fleming for raising this important issue.  The Government will invest &euro;260 million in child care this year, supporting child care provision for more than 100,000 children in the State.  Despite budgetary pressures, the Government was determined to protect the early childhood care and education programme so that children continue to have access to this vital opportunity and to protect the employment of thousands of child care workers to which the Deputy refers.  The early childhood care and education scheme provides one year of preschool care and education to more than 67,000 children, saving parents approximately &euro;2,500 a year in child care costs.  This week, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, is commencing a high-level interdepartmental group to conduct a focus study on the area and to set out the direction of what the Deputy is looking for, a whole of Government approach to future investment in child care.  This applies to the early years and school age children.  The group will set out the policy goals for future investment, which is at the heart of the matter; examine current provision to see if it is a good fit for the goals; learn from best practice, including the experience of other countries; identify costed options for future investment; and,make recommendations to the Minister.<\/p><p>The group is due to report to the Government in six months time.  The Minister and the Government are alive to the issue raised by the Deputy.  The terms and conditions of employment, as well as the career stability prospects for individuals working in the sector, are extremely important.  Irrespective of what public service they are providing, it is important that staff have stability of employment, a stake in their jobs and can see a future for themselves in their work.  We value their involvement and contributions, as well as the involvement of the trade unions.  It is welcome that Deputies are responding to the issue after it was raised this week.  It is an important debate and the issues Deputy Tom Fleming raised will be considered by the Minister when he receives the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900015#N01200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424345700,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's statement on the working group.  It is imperative that the report be fast forwarded because we need to put in place a strategy for the next three to five years.  I, therefore, ask that the matter be expedited and treated with urgency.  In the past 30 years Ireland changed from a society in which mothers, by and large, stayed at home to one in which there is greater diversity and engagement in work because of the need to expand the workforce.  Facilities have been put in place, but we have fallen down in providing adequate resources and funding to ensure the provision of high quality services in this sector.  The societal changes that have taken place should be recognised by the Government, even at this late stage, and reflected in its policies and budgets.  I, therefore, ask that the matter be addressed in the next budget.  The State should also fund administration costs which are outside the area of direct contact with children.  Assessments and meetings are necessary, but there is no funding for that additional work.  I urge the Government to increase the level of early childhood capitation funding and link it with the nationally agreed pay scales, introduce mechanisms to ensure children with additional needs will be supported in engaging as equals in their early childhood education setting and include free hours to engage in continuing professional development as part of all Government funded schemes to enable those working in the sector to fully implement the national curriculum and quality frameworks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900016#O00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1424345700,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I will communicate the Deputy's insights to the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.  Many of the points he raised are valid.  It is not a question of the Government waking up to the importance of child care.  We are very conscious of the importance of proper systems of child care and investing in the sector.  Like every other sector, its ability to expand was arrested by the fact that resources were greatly limited owing to the economic situation.  The country is now in a much better place and it is possible to look to the future with more confidence, particularly in the child care sector.  It is extremely important for families, but it is also an economic imperative that we support it.  As the Deputy noted, the nature of work and working patterns have changed.  In fairness to the child care system, it has reflected this.  The Government has undertaken or supported a number of initiatives in this regard, including child care employment and training supports, the community child care subvention programme, community employment child care programme and the after school child care scheme.  Numerous schemes and programmes are in place, but we want to see further investment in the sector.  The Minister will study the report of the group.  Representatives of various Departments, all of the agencies involved, the trade unions and interested parties can contribute to the group's work and the Minister will then be in a position to make proposals for developing the sector further.  This is critical for individuals and families, as well as the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900016#O00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1424345700,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900016#O00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1424345700,"counter":242,"content":"<p>As both Bills listed for today have already been brought to a conclusion, it is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the sitting shall be suspended immediately after the Order of Business until 2 p.m. at which time Topical Issues shall be taken; and (2) the next fortnightly Friday sitting for the purposes of Standing Orders 21(1)(a) and 28(3) shall be on 6 March 2015 and that any item already drawn for fortnightly Friday business on 20 February and 6 March shall be taken on 6 March and 27 March, respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900016#O00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1424345700,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I have two proposals to put to the House.

Moreover, it is highly topical, given the announcement by the Minister last week of the postponement of the implementation of the new model for allocation of resources hours and learning support.  This announcement has created much worry and anxiety for a number of people.  I acknowledge that it is important to get this right and note that my colleague, Deputy Colm Keaveney, previously sought to highlight a number of concerns shared by Members on this side of the House about the new model, as proposed.  I reiterate that it is important to get this right, as the current scheme has many inconsistencies with regard to learning support, which is simply allocated to the school which has discretion to decide which children receive the specified hours.  Moreover, in respect of resource allocation, some children wait anything up to two years for a diagnosis.  Consequently, it is important that the model be tweaked and that we get it right.<br\/><br\/>It is important to reflect the true realities of what is going on.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, should note that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 stipulates that a child with special educational needs shall be educated in an inclusive environment with children who do not have such needs.  The Minister of State's senior colleague recently addressed the annual conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, and used the quotation:<blockquote>I could be anything at all with half<br \/><br \/>the chance.  But today, I am going to change the world.<\/blockquote>Does she realise this is also the ambition of Down Syndrome Ireland?  At the conference she also spoke about research which showed that early intervention was often the key to improving educational outcomes and stated she was aware that children's education was about much more than reading and writing.  Down Syndrome Ireland is extremely concerned about the proposed delay and I understand the Minister may have been meeting representatives of the organisation today.  However, I met representatives and parents in my constituency during the week who spoke emotionally and frankly about their experiences of their children's diagnoses.  On the diagnosis, one parent has written:<blockquote>It's mild.  I should be rejoicing and celebrating; my glass is half-full, my daughter has a chance, she has &quot;good cognitive scores&quot;.  They tell me this means she has a good IQ ... [She] is an exceptional child, she went through junior infants, senior infants and first class with no learning support and no resource teaching.  Her teachers over the years consistently say that Anna brings a very positive dimension to the class.  But now she has developed emotional and behavioural issues; it was only when she did poorly in a sten test at the end of first class that she qualified for limited learning support this year.  She needs extra help.<\/blockquote>While she needs such help, unfortunately, she is not getting it.<br\/><br\/>I met another woman - I will call her Mary to avoid revealing her identity - who told me her son's diagnosis had changed from mild to moderate and that he had been moved from his local national school which could not meet his needs to a special school outside his community.  A woman I will call Emily has a daughter who is three and a half years old and has just been given a mild diagnosis, even though she suffers from significant speech delay.  She is non-verbal and her mother is extremely concerned and worried.  Her perception is that she is being punished because she gave so much support to her child that she was given a mild diagnosis.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by asking two questions.  In the period during which the scheme is being reviewed will the Minister abolish, straightaway, the misconceived label of mild learning disability for Down's syndrome children?  This is a well recognised medical condition with multiple disabilities and which is recognised as an intellectual disability.  Second, the system is flawed, as children with Down's syndrome are not treated equally.  A child with Asperger's syndrome and a high IQ is eligible for resource hours, which is right and proper.  Surely, however, it should be the same for a child with Down's syndrome who is deemed ineligible if his or her IQ is in the mild learning disability range.  There must be equality and fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900020#S00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1424348100,"counter":321,"content":"<p>First, I relay the apologies of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  While she had hoped to be present, the Deputy will appreciate that, on foot of the change of times, the debate clashed with something else and she is unable to be present.  Consequently, I will make this statement on her behalf.  I reiterate that she is sorry not to be present because this is an important issue, about which I have spoken to her and the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I advise him that under the existing allocation system, all pupils with Down's syndrome, including such pupils in the mild range, are entitled to receive additional teaching support.  Such support is provided either from a school's allocation of learning support or resource teaching hours under the general allocation model, GAM, or from an allocation of additional resource teacher hours allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It should be noted that, whether resource teaching hours are allocated to schools under the general allocation model or through an allocation made by the NCSE based on an individual assessment of low-incidence special needs, it is a matter for schools to utilise and manage these resources to best provide for the teaching needs of qualifying children.  Each school will use its professional judgment to decide how the provision of additional resource teaching time and hours is made to qualifying pupils in the school to ensure all of their individual needs are met.  Schools have discretion in how they allocate their general allocation hours to pupils.  Whereas schools will have regard to the number of pupils who require additional teaching support in a school, they are not constrained in the number of hours they may allocate to pupils who may have Down's syndrome and may be in the mild range.  This is an important clarification because there is some confusion in this regard.  I have also met a lot of parents affected by this matter and the Deputy is correct that they need a changed system to be able to ensure they receive exactly the services they need.  Schools are encouraged to allocate hours to pupils while taking into account the extent of their individual learning needs.  They may also increase the amount of additional teaching time they provide for pupils by using a combination of individualised teaching time with pair and group work.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE was asked to provide policy advice on the issue of whether Down's syndrome should be reclassified as a low-incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability.  In its policy advice it stated it could not establish an evidence base to support a recommendation that a child with Down's syndrome be allocated supports over and above those provided for other children with mild learning disabilities or children with other syndromes that also have associated co-occurring conditions.  However, it also recommended that under a new resource allocation model proposed by the council, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  This is probably the issue the Deputy is raising in regard to the NCSE's recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that last week the Minister announced her intention to retain the current model for allocating resource and learning support teachers to schools for the coming school year to ensure sufficient time would be allowed for further consultation to take place with education stakeholders and address a number of outstanding issues before the new model was implemented in schools.  As the Deputy stated, the proposal was not perfect either and still required some clarification and tweaking.  Concerns were raised on both sides, by people who had concerns about it but also by those who sought to have it brought forward as quickly as possible.  It is a balancing act to get it right and I note that the Deputy has made the point that it is important to get it right.  I share that view, as does the Minister.  While we must get it right and certainly must not put it off indefinitely, to use it for this year and the coming term, it would have been necessary for it to be implemented last week.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has informed me that some parents and organisations representing children with Down's syndrome continue to have concerns that the existing system does not give them certainty on the number of resource teaching hours that may be allocated to their children under the general allocation model, as these hours are distributed locally by schools.  She will take into account these concerns and listen to the views of parents and representative organisations.  To clarify, this morning she met representatives of Down Syndrome Ireland, as well as some parents.

It is an important issue, one which we all want to see corrected.  There is no point in rushing the model when all the evidence we need to get it right is not together yet.  The message needs to go out that the system has not been put off indefinitely but that it is a matter of tweaking and getting it right.  It was not possible to get it in place for the coming September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900020#S00400","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424348700,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The message is the Department is reconfiguring the system which is correct.  It is critically important, however, that those who need additional supports get them now.  Twelve months without necessary supports is a significant time for such children when two to four years of age.  The difficulty with the allocation of learning support hours and resource hours is that it is at the schools&rsquo; discretion.  One parent stated to me in a letter:<blockquote>These supports are provided as part of the school&rsquo;s general allocation.  [My son] is basically under a compliment to that system and we pray that some bureaucrat does not change the school&rsquo;s budget which could take away these resources with the stroke of a pen.<\/blockquote>These are the anxieties over this system.  The simple truth is that Down&rsquo;s syndrome is a condition diagnosed at birth that affects speech, co-ordination, hearing and cognitive skills.  Children diagnosed with a mild degree of Down&rsquo;s syndrome are being told they are not bad enough to qualify for educational supports.  Essentially, they are being discriminated against.  There are parents who have invested much time, effort and resources to support their children before these tests.  However, as their children are diagnosed as mild, they are discriminated against.  That needs to be reviewed in light of the evidence that is coming forward from parents.<br\/><br\/>One parent wrote to me:<blockquote>Education, as we all know, is the building blocks that give all children, with or without a disability, the skills they need later in life, yet the current system is allowing a small section of children to be denied the extra resources they need to gain and develop these self-same skills.  Give our children a fighting chance and leave them and us, their parents, with our dignity.  Do not turn us into beggars, pleading with civil servants for what our children need.  Let us enjoy our children, just as we do their siblings, without the constant worrying about their education.  We know they have a disability, we live with it every day, you do not need to constantly remind us of their condition by making us grovel and stress.<\/blockquote>I know the Minister of State is genuinely concerned about this matter.  He must listen to the concerns of Down Syndrome Ireland.  Deputy Finian McGrath introduced a Private Members Bill recognising Down&rsquo;s syndrome as a low incidence disorder to ensure adequate provision of resource teaching hours.  It was not opposed by the Government and was supported by all Members.  We need to progress this legislation because every week of a delay is very difficult for the children in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900021#T00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1424348700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I will bring all these issues to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  Every Member wants to see this whole area changed.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has put forward recommendations for a new allocation model that will ensure resources will be allocated based on children&rsquo;s needs and their level of need, not their category of disability.  That is what the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, wants to do.  She met with Down Syndrome Ireland this morning and will take on board its suggestions.  She will also meet with some parents.  The Deputy has correspondence from some parents explaining how they feel what they are up against.  We have been given a good look-in through the articles by Brendan O&rsquo;Connor over the past several weeks in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, painting the picture of how difficult it is for parents to get the resources they need.<br\/><br\/>We all know this model has to change but we have to get it right, as the Deputy said himself.  The Minister feels very strongly that rushing it through in the last month would not work because all the evidence needed to ensure it is right is not there and it is an issue that crosses several Departments.<br\/><br\/>As to what can be done in the meantime for a short-term solution, as the Deputy raised this afternoon, I will bring it up with the Minister.  Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s Bill was not opposed by the Government.  The NCSE which gives policy advice on this matter, however, did not agree with the legislation.  It stated it could not establish an evidence base to support a recommendation that a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome should be allocated supports over and above other children with mild learning disabilities.  It is proposing a new model which will give the same solution.  We have to join the dots and see what we can do.<br\/><br\/>I will bring this matter back to the Minister and make sure she contacts the Deputy on this.

I understand the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not available today to take the matter in the Chamber due to a busy schedule.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the publishing of the full details of those receiving single farm payments.  I accept it has come about from a decision by the European Commission.  My concern is not over transparency or accountability in the payments system as this is European taxpayers&rsquo; money being spent.  We know from the single farm payment we get job security, food security and food quality.<\/p>  <p>  My concern, however, is from the perspective of rural crime.  We will be publishing on a set day the names and addresses of individual farmers receiving X amount of money.  That is making it a little too easy for a criminal who might want to pick off someone who lives in an isolated rural area.  Ministers and the Department always like to announce when the single farm payments will be paid, as it is a good news story and an event for which the farming community waits.  Why do the name and the address of the recipient have to be published?  Why not the name and just the county or the herd number and the amount?  It must be possible to make it more difficult for criminals.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt the ministerial reply will explain how this whole process was arrived at.  However, we can be very overzealous in how we implement European Commission rules.  Did the Department have an opportunity to say it has an issue with this?  This process was to be introduced several years ago but three German farmers stopped it at the time.  The European Court of Justice deliberated on it for some time and here we go again.  Outside of farming, we have very strict and correct data protection laws.  One cannot even make a telephone inquiry about a family member&rsquo;s health appointment or insurance details because of data protection regulations.  In this case, however, we are publishing detailed information about the farmers and the amounts they have received.  I cannot understand how that does not run against data protection law.  The European Court of Justice certainly thought it did several years ago.  We need to be very careful how we set this out.<\/p>  <p>  Were the farming organisations consulted on this?  I do not know why we have gone the whole hog in publishing all these names and addresses.  The Department is only too well aware of the amounts farmers receive from the scheme, as it is very quick to claw it back when it believes it has overspent.  There is a very clear and transparent system there already.  Will the Minister go back to the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, to ensure this information is not as detailed when published to ensure the protection and safety of farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900021#T00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1424349300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this very important issue.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is unfortunately not available to take the Topical Issue but I am responding in his place.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to November 2010 member states were obliged under EU legislation to publish information - names, addresses and amounts received - on recipients of amounts paid out of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EAGF, or European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, CAP funds.  This information was made available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine website and, in line with EU requirements, included a search engine to permit users to search the database using different criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  On 9 November 2010, following its judgment in a case taken by German CAP beneficiaries, the European Court of Justice found that aspects of EU legislation requiring the publication of information on beneficiaries of CAP funds, who are natural persons, were invalid.  On the day that the judgment was delivered the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took down the CAP beneficiaries' database from its website.  Following that judgment and pending the adoption of new rules taking account of the objections expressed by the court, the EU Commission adopted amending legislation in order to lay down explicitly that the obligation to publish the information on the beneficiaries does not apply to natural persons.  However, they instructed member states to continue to publish information on legal persons and the Department has done so on an annual basis.<\/p>  <p>  Following the extensive analysis and the consultation with the stakeholders, the EU Commission determined that it was critical that any new proposal must observe a balance between the pursued objective of the public control of the use of the money from the EAGF and the EAFRD on the one hand, and the beneficiaries' right to respect for their private life in general and to protection of their personal data on the other.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2012 the Commission made a proposal on the publication of data on amounts received by all beneficiaries - natural and legal persons - that was intended to take account of the European Court of Justice judgment.  The Commission's basic rationale was that it considered it vital to inform citizens how Union funds are being spent and that the new rules are based on a justification centred on the need for public control over the use of funds.  The proposals were the subject of intensive discussion at Council meetings and subsequently in the formal discussions with the EU Commission and the European Parliament which led to the adoption of the new CAP and the legislation which underpins it.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with EU legislation the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is obliged to ensure annual ex-post publication of all of the beneficiaries of CAP funding including both legal and non-legal persons.  In accordance with regulations the Department must publish the name of the beneficiary, unless the amount of payment under CAP funds is less than &euro;1,250 in which case the individual will be identified by a code; the municipality where the beneficiary is resident; the amount of payment corresponding to each measure received by a beneficiary; and the nature and description of each measure.  In accordance with the regulation the Department will publish such information by the 31 May 2015 deadline.  Work is currently ongoing within the Department on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900022#U00100","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1424349300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  The last line is the bit I am most concerned about, which I think should be reconsidered, is where it states they are going ahead with this by 31 May and that is it.<\/p>  <p>  No one is hiding anything here.  The Department is well aware of what each farmer receives.  The EU auditors are over here every year making sure every cent of taxpayers' money is spent properly and, if it was not being spent properly, we would know about it and the whole of Europe would know about it.  I am not sure why we are so hell bent on this extra step forward all of the time.  <\/p>  <p>  I will always bring it back to the local.  I apologise for being parochial but I cannot understand, particularly for those in very rural constituencies who may live a number of miles away from their neighbours, why we have to publish the name, address and amount of money they are about to receive and then we announce when they receive it.  If a gang of criminals wants to target a house or farm, we effectively tell them when the money is going to arrive.  I really cannot understand this and the matter should be re-examined.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I want to state publicly that this is not about accountability or wanting to prevent transparency.  We have that already.  The Department should just publish the county and name, for example - County Galway, Paul Connaughton and the number.  That does not mean much to anybody but people will know what I received.  Why we have to give the address and other details is really beyond me.  In some parts of our society, such as health or education, we are very strict on data protection law, and correctly so.  All of a sudden, for farming, data protection does not seem to be talked about due to this over-zealousness of the European Union.  These proposals were knocked back a few years ago and here they come again.  I request that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, go back to the Commission and say we have some concerns.  He should ask that we address them and arrive at a fair and feasible solution where we give the Commission the transparency it wants while protecting the identity and addresses of farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900022#U00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1424349300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises a fair comment about what are effectively security concerns.

I know most of the services across the country are under pressure.  Demand is increasing, whether that is because people are more willing to come forward or because the incidence of domestic violence is increasing.  I hope it is not the latter, but I believe there is some evidence to show that it is.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise the issue of Laois Domestic Abuse Service, based in Portlaoise, and to outline briefly the situation in which it is operating at the moment.  It has one full-time and one part-time staff member, with community employment placements from time to time - there are two at present - which are welcome.  In 2014 it had &euro;64,000 in funding for the full-time position and for operational costs such as rent, travel and all other expenses.  A part-time position was added on to that, which is funded by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  The service then raised &euro;12,000 in voluntary funds.  It is operating on a fairly tight budget, but, as of yet - I checked within the last ten minutes - it has not received a funding allocation for 2015.  It has less than &euro;1,000 left in the kitty.<\/p>  <p>  The service welcomes the funding and State support it is getting.  The staff are providing a marvellous service, but funding is precarious.  They need that part-time position, which has been funded by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  They really need a full-time position and additional funding.  They dealt thoroughly with 911 separate cases over the seven-year period up to the end of last year.  In 2014 alone, there was 166 new cases, new women coming in the door, and 116 repeats, for want of a better term - women who had been there before.<\/p>  <p>  The service is comprehensive and professional.  It is provided out of a small house on the Abbeyleix road in Portlaoise, in Kellyville Court, just opposite the Garda barracks.  The feedback I get is good.  The service does not have funding for child counselling services and there is a related issue about children who are victims of or witness domestic violence.  I had a reply from Tusla dated 4 February which covered this issue but did not actually deal with the fact that they do not receive funding for this.  Tusla said that funding was provided to other agencies in the area but they are talking about children who are victims of or who witness domestic violence.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding for this service is very precarious at present, its workload is increasing massively and the funding for extra services such as child counselling is critical.  There is a need for some certainty.<\/p><p>Tusla has confirmed that a new system for managing funding applications, which it calls a commissioning process, is being put in place.  It has indicated that it is not in a position to manage the current system.  According to my information, Tusla will basically set up a federation through which funding will be provided rather than directly through it.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter which I raise because, as a Deputy for County Laois, I am very concerned that this service is kept going.  It is under severe pressure and needs modest resources.  l would welcome any positive information which the Minister of State might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021900022#U00800","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424349900,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government's approach to the funding of domestic violence services around the country and in the Deputy's constituency of County Laois.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, with the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence service provision is under one body with clear national direction.  Services can now be delivered within a wide child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, &euro;17 million in funding was provided by the Child and Family Agency by way of grant aid to 62 specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services.  These include 16 rape crisis centres-sexual violence services; 44 domestic violence services, including 20 refuges; and two national networks.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, funding of &euro;2.54 million has transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affair's Vote from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which, in turn, has been transferred to Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  This funding was previously distributed under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 and is for domestic violence refuge services.  The purpose of this funding transfer is to ensure that the State's relationship with the domestic violence services is managed in a manner which is more coherent and adapted to the needs of service users, that is, victims of domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, Tusla funded specialist domestic violence services in County Laois provided by Laois Domestic Abuse Services in Portlaoise.  The service received &euro;64,900 in funding from Tusla last year.  As the Deputy outlined, the service involves the provision of domestic violence supports, including information, advocacy and counselling services to women experiencing, or who have experienced, domestic violence.  The work of Laois Domestic Abuse Services and other community-based domestic violence services is recognised and absolutely valued.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has recently completed an initial review of domestic violence and sexual violence services in order to identify strategic priorities and set out a Tusla roadmap for sexual violence and domestic violence services.  There is for the first time a consolidated national budget for these services and an opportunity for more co-ordinated and equitable provision of sexual and domestic violence services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla will communicate with funded services shortly to advise on the Tusla budget and funding for 2015.

The Minister of State said the agency has advised that population size will be one of the factors informing the process.  I welcome that and was going to raise it with the Minister of State.  County Laois does not have a huge population - it is approximately 84,000 - but the service covers a large catchment area and sometimes people come from north Tipperary or west Offaly where there may be gaps in services.  We should take the size of the region into account when allocating funding.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, the last year for which I have figures, County Carlow, which is a similar size to County Laois, received &euro;134,000 while County Laois received &euro;56,000, although the Minister of State is correct that it received &euro;64,900 last year.  By the way, I am not arguing for County Carlow's funding to be reduced.  County Tipperary received &euro;176,000 while County Longford received &euro;124,000 in 2011.  The Minister of State will be able to see the problem there and I welcome the fact population size will be taken into consideration.  That is a very positive move, as is the fact there will be a consolidated fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said Tusla will communicate with funding services shortly to advise.  Will he raise this in the Department and convey to the civil servants, Tusla and the funding agency that Laois Domestic Violence Service is really under pressure and is operating on a wing and a prayer?  Can the funding be expedited because it now almost the end of February and Laois Domestic Violence Service had a very busy year last year and its resources are on the floor?  Will the Minister of State work that out with the senior officials?<\/p>  <p>  I referred to the other counties not to have their funding lowered but to illustrate the 2011 model.  I welcome the move towards equalisation based on population.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State raise the issue of a second full-time position in Laois Domestic Violence Service?  There is only one full-time position.  The co-ordinator, Ms Marna Carroll, does amazing work but there is only so much she can do.

Setting up the family law centres was one of the positive things we did.  They are under pressure but that is a matter for another day.  The other positive thing we did was to set up these centres and we must ensure they continue.
