We are pleased to inform the committee about NAMA's activity in the housing market - activity that has been, and will continue to be, positive.  Mr. Brendan McDonagh will take the committee through our presentation in detail while I will set out in summary what NAMA has done to date.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that ever since we began our operations, NAMA's focus has been on getting people into homes, not out of them.  Our track record proves this.  We inherited approximately 14,000 empty homes and, working with debtors and receivers, we found tenants or buyers to live in the overwhelming majority of them.  This was a significant injection of thousands of units of supply into the housing market as we matched up empty homes with people who needed a place to live.  In total, we have facilitated more than 11,000 individual buyers - families, couples and individuals - who have bought homes from our debtors or receivers.<\/p><p>In fact, contrary to the perceived wisdom that NAMA has sold most of its residential portfolio to so-called vulture funds, 88% of all the homes that have been acquired from the NAMA portfolio over the past five years have been bought by individual buyers in individual transactions.  There are some who mistakenly claim that only big investment groups have been able to buy NAMA houses and apartments.  These claims are not true and are contrary to the factual position.  Where we have sold houses and apartments in larger groups, it is because there were already people living in them and the alternative of selling the properties individually would have meant removing those people.<\/p><p> In addition, it is easy to forget that in 2012, at a time when many people were afraid to buy homes because prices were falling, NAMA introduced a groundbreaking scheme to protect people buying a home from further price falls &ndash; we deferred 20% for five years.  This scheme, called the deferred payment initiative, allowed people to buy with the knowledge that they were unlikely to lose money.  It was effective.  It worked.  It brought confidence back.  Our influence is often overstated.<\/p><p> Turning to NAMA's wider activities, it is fair to say we are in a quite unusual position in NAMA.  Many organisations spend a lot of time reminding people that they are bigger or more influential than it seems at first glance but in NAMA, we often need to do the opposite.  One of our challenges is to remind people that our capacity to influence the residential property market is often overstated.  We are not &ndash; indeed, we never were &ndash; the biggest property company in the world.  In fact, we do not own the properties; our debtors do.  Our loan book, currently valued at approximately &euro;7 billion, is a fraction of the size of the loan books of the main Irish banks and one third of this loan book is outside Ireland.  We are a long way from being the biggest property lender in Ireland, let alone the world.<\/p><p> Similarly, many think that NAMA is a dominant player in the housing market in Ireland but they should consider the following: there are 2 million homes in Ireland, only 6,000 or 0.3% of which are currently in the hands of NAMA debtors and nearly all of these 6,000 units are currently occupied by tenants - those which are not are actively on the market for sale by the relevant debtors and receivers.  Therefore, there is really no hidden supply of houses that NAMA is keeping from the market.  By and large, the houses that secure our loans are occupied and those that are not occupied are for sale to people who want to live in them or people who want to rent them to tenants.<\/p><p> However, I am pleased to say that NAMA is playing a significant role in delivering new houses and apartments, by working with our debtors and receivers on a commercial basis.  We have already funded the completion of 2,700 new homes and we have previously announced plans to fund on a commercial basis the delivery up to 20,000 new units over the period 2016 to 2020.  This strategy has twin benefits for the Irish taxpayer.  The first is that investing in new housing will enhance the return we get from the assets in our portfolio.  The second is that we are bringing much needed supply to the housing market, helping to ease the shortage that has emerged and making it easier for people to find a good place to live.<\/p><p> We have also worked hard, with our debtors and receivers, to do what we can to deliver social housing.  There are limits to what we can do but we are pleased to have delivered to date more than 2,100 social housing units to local authorities or housing bodies.  In fact, demand has been confirmed for 2,531 such units and in his presentation, Mr. McDonagh will take the committee through those figures in more detail.  To put this figure in context, it represents approximately one third of all 5,700 Part V social housing units delivered from all sources throughout Ireland between 2002 and 2011.  It is worth remembering that more than 550,000 new houses and apartments were built in Ireland during the period 2002 to 2011 and yet the total Part V dividend was only 5,700 social housing units.<\/p><p> In total, we have offered approximately 6,700 units for social housing purposes.  This was the biggest number we could offer, as any other houses or apartments that were in our portfolio were either occupied or for sale.  We could only have increased this number by moving tenants out of their homes which would have simply displaced one group of people by giving their homes to another group.  It would have made no sense.<\/p><p>The difference between the 6,700 we offered and the 2,500 is explained by the fact that the final decision on what properties go into social housing is, quite properly, a matter for the local authorities and housing bodies.  We understand why they make such decisions - primarily because the units were not in the locations where social housing was needed or they were too big or too small for their requirements.<\/p><p> As far as NAMA is concerned, we are always keen that any social housing we deliver will be to a high standard.  So, for example, in cases where units were incomplete, we have spent more than &euro;100 million to complete them.  We also spent another &euro;160 million to deliver social housing through National Asset Residential Properties Services, NARPS, which a special purpose company we set up to expedite the delivery of these units.  It buys the properties from debtors and then leases them to voluntary and co-operative housing bodies, which puts less of a cash strain on those bodies.  In short, we have made a significant input to social housing delivery to date and will continue to do so where possible.<\/p><p> Some people would have us believe there are easy answers to all of Ireland&rsquo;s housing problems.  I am sure that this committee, having sat for several sessions, knows that this is not the case.  We do not agree either.  There are barriers, which we can discuss later, but by working together, many of these can be overcome.  I welcome the deliberations of this committee which, I believe, will identify and shape sustainable policy solutions.<\/p><p> NAMA will deliver 20,000 residential units by 2020 and will make a meaningful impact on housing supply, but any analysis that claims we can deliver all the homes that people need is mistaken.  We have a mandate to invest commercially, use taxpayers' money wisely, and work professionally with our debtors and receivers to deliver the best financial return that can be achieved from the assets in our portfolio.  Our plan to deliver 20,000 new units is ambitious and challenging, but we will do it in a manner consistent with our mandate.  However, in terms of the important work of this committee, those 20,000 represent approximately one fifth of the estimated 100,000 units demanded between now and 2020.  This means that other players will have to make a contribution.  We want to get more people into more homes and we have every confidence that we will do so.<\/p><p> If the Chairman so wishes, I will now hand over to Mr. Brendan McDonagh to outline in more detail just how we will go about doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly and call Mr. McDonagh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#D00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Good morning, Chairman.  All members of the committee should have a copy of the presentation.  I will quickly run through it just to bring out some of the key points.  As the Chairman said, what we acquired from the banks were loans.  We do not own the properties.  The debtors who took out the loans own the properties and that is something which has to be kept in mind.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the agency's mandate, section 10 of the NAMA Act is very clear.  We must obtain the best achievable financial return for the Sate.  We have to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired for it and we have to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.  What that boils down to is that the NAMA board is obliged to follow a clear commercial mandate.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our acquisition process, we acquired some land and development which was security for appropriated loans mainly in 2010 and 2011.  We did not acquire residential mortgages, owner-occupied or buy-to-let.  There were some incidental residential mortgages which were attached to large debtor loans, but they were not a big part.<\/p> <p>  There were about 14,000 completed residential units in Ireland, which is less than 1% of the 2 million housing stock and apartments.  When we acquired them, they were built but they were not occupied.  As regards 15% of these 14,000 units, we worked with the debtors to correct income flow very quickly by effectively getting them tenanted after NAMA acquired the loans because, in effect, there was not a market to be able to sell them into.<\/p> <p>  We also offered over 6,600 units to local authorities and housing agencies for social housing.  Between the time that we offered them and the time they confirmed demand, obviously, in the context of a live portfolio of debtors, some of these were either sold or let in the market.  About 2,500 of those were not deemed suitable by local authorities and housing agencies, for various reasons.  As regards those 2,500, when we did the presentation, demand had been confirmed for about 2,042.  It has now gone up to 2,100 which have effectively been contracted to be delivered.  There are about another 500 which are currently under active negotiations.<\/p><p>In terms of that, we have put money into incomplete housing, approximately &euro;100 million to date, to bring it up to current building standards.  We have also made use, as the chairman outlined, of a vehicle whereby we buy the units at market value from debtors and receivers and enter into leases with the approved housing bodies.  One of the initiatives we engaged in at the start when we got involved in this and there was a different form of lease for each approved housing body was to set up a standardised lease that goes to everybody rather than having different leases and that has worked out very well.<\/p><p> In terms of social housing, there are some key facts to dispel some of the myths out there.  Anything that could be offered in a portfolio, we offered up.  We have absolutely no control over the take-up of the properties we offered up.  That is a decision of the local authorities and the Housing Agency.  We will make whatever funding is needed to make the houses habitable available.  Sometimes this requires money for remediation plans which have to be agreed with the local authorities.  That is fine.  We will not offer a product to any tenant which does not meet the requisite standards.  There is no point in putting somebody in bad accommodation.  Where the demand is not confirmed by the local authority for whatever reason, our experience has been that the private sector market primarily rents those properties from our debtors.  That is the 6,000 units that remain in our portfolio.  The occupancy rate is up at 99%.  The other 1% is frictional as people move in and out.  In terms of the figures around that, budgetary constraints have meant local authorities have not had the capital available from central Government to buy units but sometimes approved housing bodies have capital available.  To date, approximately 39% has been by direct sale, 6% has been by direct lease and 55% has been us buying and leasing the units directly to the approved housing bodies.  That is becoming a bigger feature of that, especially during 2015 where, in effect, 73% of all social housing that we leased was through us buying them from a subsidiary and doing the leases with the approved housing bodies.<\/p><p> The next two pages of the presentation set out by county how the 6,600 units were offered across each local authority, where the demand was confirmed and what has been delivered to date.  I do not plan to go through them in detail but members can come back with their questions on them.  I will go to page 10 which has pictures of some of the units that have been delivered.  The reality is that this accommodation is done to a very high standard and is finished out.  On page 11 of the presentation, a key point is that our debtors have sold 12,781 individual homes to people since 2010, which is when we acquired the loans, of which 11,219 have been bought by individual buyers and 1,562 bought by people who are what we call \"professional buyers in the market\" who do long-term leasing, including REITs and Kennedy Wilson.<\/p><p> In terms of the sale of loans, there are some key principles around this.  We do not ask our debtors' receivers to seek vacant possession of residential property if a loan book is going up for sale.  We go through the portfolio to see if there are more properties which can be taken out to be used for social housing.  We also go through and look at the land bank with each of those portfolios to see if there is any land-banking there which would make commercial sense for us to fund.  The reality is that in terms of our biggest loan book sale, which was Project Arrow last year, we took out 425 properties before that went to the market which were used for social housing purposes, based on demand as set by the Housing Agency approved housing body.<\/p><p> I refer to page 16.  Within the NAMA portfolio, the land bank held by our debtors is approximately 2,800 ha which is broken down there by county.  As members can see, the biggest elements are in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Limerick.  In effect, our portfolio is very urban-centric.<\/p><p> In terms of NAMA funding 20,000 units by the end of 2020, approximately 1,500 ha of the 2,800 ha will be required.  There are some significant barriers to the delivery of new housing on residual lands in the portfolio, namely, achieving planning permission and commercial viability.  The biggest issue, however, is the infrastructure deficit such as lack of roads, water and sewerage facilities.<\/p><p> From 2009 to date, construction costs have been relatively stable.  As the country went into recession, obviously, house prices dropped significantly.  From 2011 to mid-2014, it was not commercially viable to put money into building new houses anywhere.  We could not do this under the NAMA legislation.  At present, it has effectively flat-lined.  While prices rose to an extent, they have effectively plateaued, much of this linked to the Central Bank mortgage measures which are a welcome influence.<\/p><p> From 2014, it became profitable to build a house, based on the sales price which could be achieved.  The typical profit we are seeing across our schemes in Dublin, the Dublin commuter belt, Cork and Galway is &euro;20,000 per unit.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has a different view and it is correct that, outside of these areas, house units do not make a profit.<\/p><p> On the sensitivity of profit-to-sales price variances, if sales prices went up by 5%, the profit would increase to &euro;30,000.  If they went up 10%, the profit would increase to &euro;40,000.  That is the dynamic of the market.<\/p><p> We have seen many figures quoted for building a typical three-bed, semi-detached house.  Some of the best figures, when compared to our benchmarks from our portfolio, were those published in January 2016 by Anthony Foley in a report for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  It set out the constituent parts of the building costs for a house.  The total construction cost comes to &euro;150,000.  When one adds in other costs such as local authority levies, Part V, finance, etc., it comes to an extra &euro;46,000.  With a profit margin of 15%, which is what the market typically targets, it adds &euro;30,000.  VAT comes to &euro;30,000.  Before the land is added, to build a typical 1,200 sq. ft. house will cost close to &euro;260,000.  The average land site for this type of house, depending on location, is somewhere between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000.  In Cork and Galway, it is somewhere between &euro;25,000 and &euro;30,000.  Accordingly, one has to get a sales price of &euro;300,000 before one can make any profit on a typical three-bedroom house.<\/p><p> The Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force looked at the estimated costs for fixing the infrastructural deficits in each of the four local authorities in Dublin.  In Fingal County Council, approximately 24,000 units are constrained by infrastructure deficits.  The cost of rectifying this would come to &euro;66 million.  In Dublin City Council, up to 5,400 units are constrained while rectifying the infrastructure deficit to deal with this would come to &euro;48 million.  In South Dublin County Council, it is 2,000 constrained units, while rectifying the infrastructure deficit would come to &euro;4.7 million, not a significant amount of money.<\/p><p>In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, it would deliver about 17,000 units and cost about &euro;45 million.  Therefore, this means that there is land across the four local authorities in Dublin with infrastructure deficits where effectively &euro;165 million could make that land viable for achieving planning permission and building houses.  This is a very important statistic.  Page 22 contains publicly available information that breaks down where the number of units could be delivered across each local authority by each area, which is quite interesting.  In respect of NAMA's funding of the 20,000 units on a commercial basis, we believe 78% of them will be in Dublin, 15% in the commuter belt and 7% outside the greater Dublin area, mainly Cork and Galway.  All our focus is on the starter home market.<\/p><p> On page 24, it states that since 2014, about 2,800 units have been delivered throughout the country.  About 3,100 units are under construction by our debtors.  Planning permission has been granted for about 5,200 units and applications for planning permission have been lodged for more than 5,000 units.  We are actively working with our debtors to get planning into local authorities for about another 6,600 units.  There is a landbank that could deliver another 25,000 units but it has infrastructure deficits and much of that land is tied up in the four local authorities in Dublin where this is required.<\/p><p> Another message that is being put out is that we are hoarding land and that if we only released more land into the market, the private sector would avail of the opportunity and build.  The reality is that since the start of 2014, in 24 months, we have sold land that could deliver 20,000 units into the private sector.  We monitor that land to see what is happening with it.  Only about 5% of that land is being built on at present.  Members ask why the people who bought it did not build on it.  Sometimes people might be looking for revised planning or waiting for a new county, area or development plan.  Sometimes there might be an issue in respect of densities, a revised planning application and seeking more semi-detached houses rather than apartments, which requires a new planning application.  Infrastructure constraints are certainly there.  One of the largest issues - from looking at transcripts, we know the committee has discussed it - is people buying land and effectively looking for a higher rate of return.  This has to be a big feature.<\/p><p> In respect of where NAMA is at present, 81% of our senior debt is repaid.  We want to pay off 100% by 2018.  That gets rid of the contingent liability of the State, which stands at &euro;5.5 billion.  We want to pay the rest of our debt by March 2020.  This is sub-debt.  We are projecting that at the end of NAMA's life, there will be a surplus that will be available to the Minister and which is already provided for in the NAMA legislation of 2009.  If members look at section 60 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, they will see that the surplus goes back to the Minister.  We estimate that this will be at least &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p> In summary, we are involved in some high-profile activities in both the residential sector and the Dublin docklands.  We believe we have an important role to play, but we recognise there is a huge issue around the need for housing.  We are doing our very best and will continue to do what we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh for the presentations, particularly the factual content and numbers included.

I am very interested in the statistics and figures they have provided.  It is a very clear indication of the work they have done as opposed to what people think they might be doing or not doing.  I have two major questions.  NAMA has identified &euro;164 million worth of infrastructure development.  The Minister for Finance said that &euro;100 million would be provided for infrastructural deficits.<\/p><p>Mr. McDonagh said the entire &euro;164.2 million was not required on stream immediately.  Given the seriousness of the crisis, should there be a one-stop shop for dealing with the infrastructure deficit rather than a situation in which different people are handling it in various local authorities?  Perhaps it could be done by an organisation such as NAMA.  In past years, the National Building Agency dealt with housing and construction issues.<\/p><p> My other question relates to the failure of local authorities to take up housing units.  I am surprised that NAMA has 2,457 units of accommodation available for local authorities to take up.  According to the list of local authorities that NAMA gave us, the ones that have declined the most units are those that have the greatest demand - namely, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and areas of County Dublin, as well as Cork city and, surprisingly, Wexford.  What is the issue?  If NAMA has homes that it will make ready for occupation, it makes no sense that councils would refuse homes that are in the areas where they are needed.  They are what we need.<\/p><p> The witnesses spoke about NAMA's commercial remit, which I accept and acknowledge.  They also acknowledged NAMA's social remit.  If one can borrow as cheaply as possible, this is the key to NAMA's work in terms of building and controlling the price of houses.  NAMA will fulfil its commercial remit if its income is greater than its loan charges.  If NAMA can borrow at 1% or 2% to build houses, it would make a huge difference to the cost of the homes.  Do the witnesses have a comment on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#G00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Could Mr. McDonagh specifically address Deputy O'Dowd's point about units that were not taken up by local authorities?

They are rented by the private sector.  There are sometimes frictional vacancies when people move out.  We constantly comb the portfolio to see if units are available.  We do not have 800 or 1,000 units.  Over a period of time, when people leave these rented units and they become free, we might be able to make a few hundred available out of the 6,000.  If people are renting units from us, we cannot displace them, as it would add to the housing problem.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd asked whether there should be a central agency.  That is a policy question for the Government and I am precluded from talking about it, but I will say something in general terms.  When centralised agencies with a specific purpose, such as the National Roads Authority, NRA, are assigned to such tasks, they build up a particular focus on it and make things happen.  They learn from their experience as they go along and they get better at it.  While I think it may have merit, it is a Government policy decision.<\/p> <p>  We have heard it said that the units NAMA offered to local authorities were sometimes rubbish.  They were not.  They might be half-completed housing developments or unfinished housing estates.  In 2010, we started with 335 unfinished housing estates in our portfolio.  We have put money in and reduced the number to 29.  We finished housing estates and put in infrastructure such as landscaping.  Some of the pictures there are of housing estates that were unfinished in 2010.<\/p><p>We will agree a site resolution plan with the local authority, put the money in and ensure the accommodation is up to current building standards.  We, therefore, do not accept that at all.<\/p><p> One of the biggest issues that we hear about is that sometimes in some of the counties listed for local authority housing, there is not huge demand.  We fully accept that but in the larger urban areas, where there is a huge crisis, one of the biggest issues we are hearing about is that there is a high concentration of social housing in those particular areas.

It started out at &euro;30 billion.  We have paid off &euro;25 billion and we are down to &euro;5 billion.  The plan is to pay that off by 2018.  The borrowing vehicle for the Government is the NTMA and it is up to the Minister for Finance if more money is to be borrowed.  We all know the rates on the market at present.  Ten-year money can be borrowed at 0.8%.  It is unprecedented how cheap that money is when the long-term average is 5.5%.  That is again a policy matter for Government in terms of whether it wants to borrow money in this cheaper interest rate environment and use it for that purpose.

By the end of 2016, we will have about 2,500 delivered and in 2017 we hope to get up to 3,500, which would make 6,000.  The other 14,000 must be delivered over the remaining years, on average, because we will be ramping up our operations.  Our debtors have to build up their platforms again because they ran them down during the recession.  They have to recruit more carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers and whatever they need, or get subcontractors.  That is what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  The planning permission extension was provided for in the NAMA Act 2009 and the subsequent Local Government Reform Act said that planning permissions could be applied for to extend it.  The Deputy is correct to say that some of that planning permission might be coming to maturity and to ask if it makes sense to look at extending it again.  This is a policy matter but it is something that may help.  Much of the planning permissions that were got up to 2008 and 2009 were for the wrong type of product.  It was for a different time and was primarily for apartments that were sometimes in locations where it just does not work and people do not want apartments.  More family type housing would be more appropriate.  There are certainly some planning permissions that would benefit from that.  Everything that can be done to help is worth doing rather than submitting a new planning application because then one is back into the whole planning process again, with people appealing and going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The timeline from having a raw site to having somebody on site is two years if there are appeals all the way through the process.  That is a very long time when there is a crisis in the market.

There is one site in Dublin - the glass bottle site - which has the potential to deliver maybe 2,000 or 3,000 housing units but there has been no progress on getting to the stage where there is a plan for that area.

There are lots of reasons why people hoard land.  There is an element of people sitting back and saying that prices will go up so they will make more profit.  This does not necessarily mean that those people will build the houses; it just means that if the prices of the houses go up, the price of the land will be a multiple of that.<\/p><p>They might decide to sell on the land again in the future but they will wait for house prices to go up first.  There are already mechanisms in place in this regard.  Effectively, the legislation already makes provision for a vacant site levy, and there is talk of introducing that towards the end of this decade.  Again, I am very reluctant to propose disincentives to build.  Nonetheless, calibration is a great thing in that it outlines what will happen if people do not do something with the land.  I believe that is very useful.<\/p><p> All of our cash is at present earmarked for building or for paying back our debt.  We cannot use our cash to fund this infrastructure deficit.  If it was a NAMA debtor's land, the way we would use our cash is to lend the debtor more money, which he would use to pay the local authority to contribute towards that infrastructure.  However, we do that on the basis that we can get our money back, and it would have to be a commercial arrangement.<\/p><p> Deputy Canney's final question concerned the profit of &euro;20,000 per unit.  That is an average.  The reality is that people will always be able to produce schemes where they say they will only make &euro;10,000 per unit on a certain type of a house in a certain development.  There are typically three, four and five bedroom houses within a scheme, and a person could make an average of &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000 on a smaller house, &euro;22,000 to &euro;25,000 on a four bedroom house and up to &euro;40,000 on a five bedroom house, of which there would be very few.  It is the average profit that is close to &euro;20,000.<\/p><p> What it comes down to, at the end of the day, is the cost of the land.  If somebody has overpaid for the land in the first place, there will be a bigger site cost and that will reduce the profit.  The Central Bank measure, by reducing the size of mortgages that people can take out, has certainly had a stabilising effect on the price of land because it is completely linked to the price of houses and, if people cannot get mortgages, they cannot buy the houses.  Again, I have my own views about the calibration of that, but, as a measure, it is a useful tool.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Mr. McDonagh referred to gearing up contractors.

However, it would be necessary in future, if at all possible, for us to have more detail about the fact that local authorities are refusing units and the reasons for this.  Picking up on the points made by Deputy O'Dowd, I sought further information recently from Dublin City Council about offers that NAMA had made to them.  I think NAMA had offered the council in the region of 828 units.  NAMA subsequently sold 190 of them.  Within that, however, the main reason was the tenure mix.  That was the reason given by the local authority.  Some 638 were offered while 400 were taken.  Some 32 units were in poor condition and had structural issues.  In the case of eight of them, the council claimed, there was a low demand.  Some 146 units were accepted in one development where 198 had been offered.  The council only took 48 of them, again because of the tenure mix, and 46 were turned down in Ballymun as well for the same reason.  In Ballymun, they are building modular homes at a cost of &euro;250,000 per unit.  They were to be built in 12 weeks but they are still not in place.  How long do they take to build?  How much did they cost?  How much were the offers made by NAMA?  What were its costs?  The point was made that there is no provision for affordable homes.  The local development plan may be outdated in comparison to the situation on the ground.  That is why it is incumbent on NAMA and the local authorities, if at all possible, to make available to this committee at a later date more detailed analysis of what was offered, what was taken and why units were not taken for us to make a judgment on that in order to correct that issue so that the new Minister can direct local authorities to have a bit more resolve in the way in which they flippantly refuse units that are being made available while there is an emergency and a crisis out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#M00600","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>That is not the case, in fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#M00700","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>That is the point I am making and the point I want addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#M00800","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>The Deputy is saying it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#M00900","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>NAMA has entered into many long-term leasing arrangements with local authorities and housing associations.  How does that sit with its lifespan?  How does that sit with the dividend that is to be returned to the State?  When is it expected there will be an interim dividend?  When is NAMA's lifespan due to end and what dividend can the State expect?  While I respect and acknowledge that the legislation governing NAMA's set-up was of course one of a commercial mandate, there was also mention of a social mandate.<\/p><p>Perhaps NAMA will be deemed profitable at the end of the day and the social mandate will accrue to the State at that stage, and the funding associated with any profitability will be used for the purpose of addressing the crisis and emergency that we have at present.  It is incumbent on the State, and those with authority within the State, to ensure the funding is accessible and used for the right purposes from our perspective.<\/p><p> My next question is on the lending rates that NAMA may be charging developers.  What are they on average?  How do they compare with the open market?  How do they compare with what is charged by the mezzanine funds in which the State is involved in some instances?  This may address the answer Mr. Daly just gave, when he spoke about the State having a role to play in the freeing up of 100,000 units.  The State has a role to play in charging appropriate rates if it is involved in making available strategic investment funding.  Such rates should be competitive and real and should yield a dividend for those partaking in the development.  At present, funding cannot be obtained, and what funding can be obtained is at exorbitant rates.  In some instances, only 60% of funding is being provided, at exorbitant rates, and more exorbitant rates are charged by mezzanine funds to make up the difference that exists.<\/p><p> With regard to Project Arrow, Mr. Daly mentioned that 425 units were taken out due to the potential for a social dividend.  What percentage of the entire residential portfolio did this entail?  With regard to the 20,000 units NAMA hopes to build by 2020, what obligation has the State placed on NAMA in legislation to provide social units?  Is it 10% or 20%?  The previous Government reduced the obligation under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 from 20% to 10%.  I did not expressly agree with this, but I know where it was coming from; it could have freed up ways and means for development to take place while allowing the 20% obligation to remain in place.  I refer again to the 100,000 units that are not being provided and the reasons they are not being provided.

There is little doubt at present that we will have surplus in excess of &euro;2 billion and this will go back to the Exchequer.  Quite obviously, it will be a matter for the Government at the time to decide what it does with it.  With the money we have and the money we have generated we are repaying the debt, which is our top priority all the time.  The debt has been, and will remain, a contingent liability on the Irish State, and if we do not repay it, that will have implications for access to money markets and confidence in Ireland.  There is a bigger issue.  I have said before the biggest social dividend we can deliver indirectly is to pay this back as quickly as we can.  We will have paid back the senior debt by 2018, and we have a small amount of subordinated debt which is due to be repaid on 1 March 2020, and we will pay it on the due date.  There is no advantage to anybody, not least to the State, in repaying it earlier.  There will be other things to be done then.<\/p> <p>  With regard to senior debt, NAMA will have its work done by 2018, but we will continue in housing and with the Dublin docklands.  Where we lease houses to housing bodies, there is a provision in the leases whereby they can buy them out at a certain stage during the lease if they want to do so.  All of this is being done through a special purpose vehicle in NAMA, so the holding of all of these leases is an asset in itself and at some stage NAMA will be able to realise this asset and its value will go indirectly from NAMA to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>There is no doubt at all that there will be a surplus and that it will go to the Exchequer, but what it will do with it will be a matter for the Government.

The Deputy mentioned that 32 units were in poor structural condition.  We have always told local authorities that if there is anything that is not of the standard they want, we will raise it to that standard.  There is no question of our not providing funding.  I just want to correct what was said.<\/p> <p>  We charge market lending rates.  Typically, our margin is 8% to 9% over the six-month EURIBOR rate, which is comparable with the rates available in the market.  Everyone refers to the high rates being charged, but they apply to one element only.  I might explain this to the committee.  On senior debt, banks typically lend 5% coupons on approximately 60% of the total.  Five per cent of 60% is 3%.  On approximately 10%, one can borrow equity on 20% coupons, which equates to a figure of 2%.  The mezzanine piece of the bill used to be approximately 12%, but mezzanine financiers have reduced their rates which are negative among central banks.  To make money, they have reduced their rates to 10% and 10% of 30% is 3%.  Adding 3%, 2% and 3% gives 8%.  Typically, one can borrow at 8% or 9% from the private sector.  We are changing the same rate.  As Deputies will appreciate, given state aid considerations, we must do so.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Part V obligations, NAMA debtors are like any other builder in the market and want to be treated the same.  If builders not in NAMA only have an obligation to provide Part V housing to a figure of 10%, NAMA debtors will have the same obligation.  It is a policy matter.

We developed this concept and it has proved itself.  It is open to other people to copy the concept.  For example, Mr. Whelan has had meetings with the credit union movement and it appears to be very interested in the concept and how it works.  Effectively, it involves the creation of a vehicle which purchases the assets on-balance sheet and then leases them out, resulting in an income into the company.  Over time, it becomes like a Government bond on the basis that money is accruing per annum.  It is a product that we believe an insurance company, perhaps, would be interested in buying in the future because, effectively, doing so is akin to buying an income stream similar to that of a Government bond.  All that is required is a bit of management and two people to run the entity into which thousands of units can be put.  We developed this entity from scratch and we have streamlined it with the leases.  In terms of the legal contracts involved, this is a technical concept but one that is eminently doable.  All that is needed is the necessary finance and interested parties such as insurance companies, the credit union movement or other funds.  It can be done.

In other words, would it not be wise and in the interests of NAMA and the taxpayer for NAMA to inquire as to what is likely to happen to a property, be that houses already built or potential development land, including, for example, whether a buyer intends to hold onto the property until such time as it appreciates in value, given current low interest rates and the possibility of a much lower dividend from the financial sector?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the local authorities' reluctance to take up offers from NAMA, were the properties concerned suitable for families or were they deemed by the local authorities to be unsuitable and to what extent, where a particular reason in that regard has been identified, has NAMA examined how best to make available properties to the local authorities into the future?<\/p> <p>  On the per square foot cost of building a house, in respect of which we have heard various projections in the past few days, has NAMA undertaken analysis in that regard, including in regard to the per square foot cost, the land value and the tax impact?  Do the witnesses appreciate that it is virtually impossible for an average family with an average income to purchase a house on the market, bearing in mind the Central Bank requirements in regard to deposits and the necessity to ensure house property inflation remains low?  In 1978, owing to rapidly increasing inflation in the housing sector, housing was removed from the consumer price index, CPI.<\/p><p>It appears there was huge inflation in house and property prices that was not visible before that.<\/p><p> I should mentioned that I am not in favour of selling to private or approved bodies.  They have abysmally failed in delivering the housing requirement and nothing will change that unless and until local authorities take direct responsibility and are recognised as the most likely body to provide alternative housing from the private sector.  With respect to local authorities, it appears from my investigations that the majority of options are for the private housing or approved housing bodies and not local authorities.  It seems it was not possible for the local authorities to access it, given the balance sheet issue, so the witness may comment on that.<\/p><p> There is the hoarding issue and an inquiry into a purchaser who intends to hoard and for what purpose is required.  Is NAMA aware that some of the lands and properties acquired over the past number of years in the downturn were the subject of multiple turnovers in ownership over a period, with each occasion inflating the price of the property hugely?  In some cases, properties were turned over up to ten times, each time with a profit for the speculator.  The question arising is whether adequate efforts are being made to ensure that properties are not disposed of to speculators.  I have no difficulty with somebody making a profit but the profit has been made several times.

There were 298 houses, I presume, made available.  Why was it not able to take those houses?  Were they unsuitable, as I have been informed, or in the wrong place, which is a possibility?  Was there some other reason?  Properties were purchased by NAMA, some at a large write-down of 40%, but in the context of the overall cost to the State, to what extent have those properties progressed in the interim?  In other words, if NAMA paid &euro;100 million for a group of properties, how would they have appreciated since?  What is the profit range, taking into account how much was paid for the properties and how much they are now worth?  Could NAMA be hoarding them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#P00800","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>The issue of properties not taken up by local authorities has come up a number of times.

If there is a receiver in place, the receiver has a legal obligation to take the best price.  That is a legal obligation so he has to have a very good reason for not accepting the best price.  Both the receiver and debtor are incentivised to get the best price for it.  Our obligation, like any secured lender, is to decide whether to release our security on the basis of the price that is offered.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the local authorities' reluctance and how sometimes they said the property was suitable or unsuitable, be it a house or apartment.  We offer what is available in a portfolio, whether it is houses or apartments, one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments and so forth, and ask if it is any use to them.  They can make their own decisions on whether they will take it on that basis.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the cost of building.  I refer him to page 20 of my presentation.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors benchmarked the building costs.  We saw that and examined it ourselves with our in-house quantity surveyors and we have seen what our debtors are doing as well.  It is a reasonable representation of the costs involved in terms of build out.  It takes account of the VAT that goes to the Exchequer, which is approximately &euro;30,000 on a typical &euro;300,000 house.  Local authority costs, planning costs, finance costs and so forth amount to approximately &euro;46,000.  The site cost in Dublin is typically up to &euro;40,000 per unit on average and less than that outside Dublin.  It is well benchmarked.<\/p> <p>  We often hear people say that the big issue is driving down the cost of construction, but the reality can be seen in one of my charts.  One would have thought that the cost of construction would have fallen dramatically during the recession, but it did not.  Effectively, it was flatlined.  The reason is that many of the costs of construction are fixed.

It has recovered somewhat now, but valuations are still 33% down from their peak, so we are not immune.  The commercial market in Dublin is completely different because at the peak, rents for commercial office space in Dublin in 2007 were about &euro;55 per square foot on average.

Thereafter, if demand was confirmed, we worked through the Housing Agency to make the units available in whatever way was deemed the most appropriate and efficient.  In most instances, because of the capital constraints the Deputy raised, the preference was for long-term leasing and, as the NAMA CEO has said, rather than trying to recreate the wheel for every single lease, NARPS was set up.

The Act gives NAMA a number of tasks.  Section 2(<i>b<\/i>)(viii) of the Act talks about contributing &quot;to the social and economic development of the State&quot;.  Mr. Daly went on to say that in his view, repaying the debt is the best social dividend.  I would have thought that at a time when the economy is growing and the debt-to-GDP ratio in general is falling, we should calculate the best social dividend by reference to the more clear social requirement to do more to tackle the housing crisis in addition to the need to repay the debt.  I say that because, as we have seen today, 6,000 people are now homeless.  According to figures released by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government today, 2,000 children are homeless.<br\/><br\/>I will come to my questions in a second.  I acknowledge that NAMA has played a role in increasing social housing stock in the State but my concern is that much of the work it has done has, in the main, been driven more by commercial calculations to the detriment of a crucial part of its legislative remit.  For example, we have heard a lot of talk about how NAMA has offered 6,700 units for social housing.  I would hate the message to go out from here today that local authorities are somehow refusing units.  People seem to forget that central government places enormous constraints on what local authorities can accept when NAMA presents properties.  I will give an example.  NAMA proposed to present 591 units to South Dublin County Council but almost 500 of them were in one location.  Central government policy under the last Government and the current Government does not allow local authorities to buy 500 units in a single location.  Even if a council wanted to do so, it would be constrained by central government policy.  Many of these units were offered in 2011 and 2012.  Not only was tenure mix a constraint from central government but location, cost and the availability of resources were also issues at a time when central government funding of local authorities was at its lowest.<br\/><br\/>I think we should explore this and I think people are right to ask these questions.  I am reminded of a headline in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>that criticised local authorities for not spending their capital allocations.  Nobody is mentioning that the procurement and tendering process insisted on by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform takes a year and a half.  It is not as if local authorities are sitting there, not spending money.  I make that point because I think the debate needs some balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#S01100","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I would like to be helpful.

They told us that after the planning stage has passed, the tendering and procurement stage can take between a year and a half and two years.  The shortened process that was made available for the rapid build project in Ballymun is currently available for rapid build projects only.  While the Department is looking at the possibility of applying that process elsewhere, it has not been applied elsewhere up to now.  They are the facts that have been presented to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask some questions.  According to the report, 1,647 units were originally offered to local authorities but were subsequently sold or leased onto the private market.  I would be interested to know whether these units were part of the original pool of units that were rejected by local authorities.  Alternatively, was the decision to put them into the private market a commercial decision of NAMA?  Perhaps it was a mix of the two.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that one of the problems for local authorities and approved housing bodies is that the more streamlined and standardised leasing model that has emerged is very cumbersome, particularly for approved housing bodies.  To what extent is NAMA aware of that?  To what extent are attempts being made to make it easier for approved housing bodies to function, particularly in the context of the NARPS vehicle?  Such bodies frequently tell us that the model in question is tricky and cumbersome and delays their ability to bring more social housing units on line.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in getting more detail on how things have been going with the special purpose vehicle, particularly since it was given an additional role by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, under the 2020 social housing strategy.  I know there have been more than 100 meetings of the working group over the last while.  If the witnesses could give the committee more information on what it is doing and what they hope its output will be, that would be useful.<\/p><p> Mr. Daly referred to the delivery by the National Asset Management Agency of 20,000 private sector units.  It is my understanding - perhaps Mr. Daly will correct me if I am wrong - that the new Part V requirements will apply to these units in the same way as they will apply to any other commercial housing development.  Given the scale of the housing crisis and the point I made about securing a social dividend, would it not be appropriate to increase the Part V element of the 20,000 new units?  Has the National Asset Management Agency discussed the possibility of increasing it to 20% or 25%, as I believe would be appropriate?<\/p><p> We also discussed the issue of land.  I am aware that, as in the case of the housing units, NAMA does not own land but holds the debts relating to it.  However, in the Fingal area - I am sure Deputy Coppinger will know more about this issue than I - one of the problems facing the local authority is the absence of publicly owned land.  As part of the social dividend set out in section 2 of the NAMA Act, could the agency transfer land owned by its debtors to the State, either at no cost or a low cost, for the provision of social housing?<\/p><p> Mr. Daly spoke about special development zones, SDZs, and their benefits.  The Clonburris SDZ is the last major parcel of development land in the South Dublin County Council area.  The majority of these lands, perhaps two thirds of them, are privately owned.  I assume the owners of at least a chunk of this land are debtors of NAMA and have a relationship with the agency.  Could innovative ideas that have not yet been discussed in the public domain be brought to bear to maximise the delivery of social units in this SDZ?<\/p><p> The programme for Government refers to the investment of a future NAMA surplus in infrastructure and social housing.  One innovative idea would be for NAMA not to return this surplus to the Exchequer on the basis that the latter may have obligations under the European Union's fiscal rules.  Portions of this surplus could then be transferred in other assets, either land or housing.  Is this possibility being considered and would it be permitted under the Act?  This could be another useful way of achieving progress.<\/p><p> I would like to see the research on which figures on housing construction costs are based.  Will Mr. Daly indicate the data on which the figures he presented are based?  Are they based on an assessment of a certain number of units across a certain period in a certain number of counties?  Every witness who has appeared before the committee gives a different account in respect of this issue.  If NAMA has more detailed research on the matter, I and other members would like to see it and the data on which it is based.  I ask Mr. Daly to provide it to us.<\/p><p> On the infrastructural deficits and the proposal to spend &euro;164 million on infrastructure development, what are these infrastructural deficits and how do they differ from the services for which developers ordinarily pay development levies to local authorities and any other levies they pay, for example, to the ESB and Irish Water?<\/p><p> While I may be taking liberties in raising the SPV model, Mr. Daly noted that Mr. Whelan has expertise in this area.  Many of us, including the new Government in its programme for Government, are discussing the possibility of using arm's-length companies or municipal housing trusts as another vehicle for having off-balance sheet spending, in this case on social housing.  Could the model to which Mr. Daly referred be applicable to municipal housing trusts or arm's-length companies which would be operated by local authorities for the purpose of increasing direct social housing provision through off-balance sheet activities?  It is currently applied to private sector interests such as insurance companies and credit unions, whose involvement in this area I would also welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#T01500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh have been asked a range of questions.

One of those, Moody's - the committee may not think much of these rating agencies and I have views on them myself - declared not long ago that NAMA is no longer a material contingent liability on the State.  All of that is important.  On top of that, we have used the cash we have generated not just to repay the debt, but also, as has been much mentioned here today, to buy and refurbish units for social housing.  We have also worked on ghost estates with local authorities and local bodies in terms of sites for schools and local communities.  There is a social overhang to everything we do.  Unless we are actually commercial and unless we had generated the funds we did in the past seven years, we would not be able to do any of that work.  We would not be funding 20,000 houses between now and 2020 and we would not have been able to deal with the social housing issue that we are discussing. <\/p><p> Many of the other questions relate to detail about units.

We will do that fairly soon.  We will continue to do that and we will continue to look at the possibilities around the 20,000 units we hope to deliver by 2020 to see whether we deliver them faster.<\/p> <p>  I ask the committee not to forget that there is a state aid complaint in Brussels about which we have to be very careful.  In some ways, that goes back to the Deputy's earlier point.  The substantive defence to the state aid complaint is that NAMA is acting commercially.  The day we stop acting commercially in that area is the day we will be in trouble with Brussels.

It is very hard to stop that happening.  If they say they have kept properties vacant for three months and the local authority has not come back to them or the Housing Agency has not been in touch, they will just lease them again to the private sector.  That is the nature of a live portfolio<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about our leases being cumbersome.  We do not accept that at all.  We have established leases with almost all of the major approved housing bodies now and they are well used to our lease.  There are no tricks in the lease as it is a standard format.  We accept that, at the start, each housing body had its own form of lease and did not want to move away from that.  However, we have said we would use our lease and they have come around and accepted it.  I understand everybody finds it difficult to change, but we try to do it the same way for everybody.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the various working groups established by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  We are not directly involved in that area.  Members of my team are involved in some working groups which arose on foot of Construction 2020 and which are looking at various issues, including as infrastructure and planning.  We are participating in that in so far as it is relevant.  The Deputy suggested providing land free to local authorities.  We cannot do that.  Under section 10 of the Act, the receiver will insist that he gets market value for the land.  However, we have facilitated the passing over of land to State bodies at market value where they have raised their hands and said they wanted it. <\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the Clonburris SDZ in terms of innovation.  We are all for innovation.  Some previous SDZs have not worked.  One of the highest profile ones that did not work out was probably Cherrywood as there were issues around it.  Another SDZ that has not worked out is Hansfield, Blanchardstown.  We have a very good relationship with South Dublin County Council and its excellent manager, Mr. McLoughlin and in terms of our experience with SDZs, our planning team has engaged with him frequently in regard to SDZs and we are all for whatever will produce the best outcome.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government mentions the surplus and whether the surplus can be cash or something else.  This is provided for under section 60 of the NAMA Act.  It provides that either cash or residual assets will be returned at the end.  Therefore, if we have unsold assets, that can be done.  In regard to information on house costs, we will come back to Deputy on those.  Our internal quantity surveyors are looking at costs and we have examined them with our debtors also.  There is no huge variation at this stage, which is the reason I raised the issue of the report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI.  Although industry bodies sometimes have their own agenda, I feel that the SCSI has produced a reasonable report.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned infrastructural deficits such as roads, sewerage and water.  Previously, in the good times, developers used to borrow from the banks and pay for the infrastructure.  That day is gone and nobody, including NAMA, will provide all the money up-front as there may be no product at the end.  We want product.  The Chairman asked how many of the 48,000 housing units in Dublin that need this infrastructure are in NAMA and the answer is approximately 13,000 to 14,000.  We are very anxious that local authorities will take on this work and we are engaged with the Department in informing it of the deficits and making it fully aware of them.<\/p> <p>  Mention was also made of the special purchase vehicle, SPV.  This is a model that can be replicated and all that is required is funding.  If the SPV has the funding capital to buy the housing stock, it can then lease to local authorities.<\/p><p>I do accept the Deputy's point that the local authorities are constrained, effectively because their capital budgets were taken away and they could not buy the houses.  That is why we did the leasing model.  We do recognise that the local authorities and the approved housing bodies do not have the capital to buy.  However, I think one of the big points here is - if one looks at the UK model - there has been a move to merge a large number of approved housing bodies in the UK.  When a merger was enforced among them it resulted in a lot of stock on their balance sheets which had been funded by capital grants over the years.  The approved housing bodies then became municipal vehicles in that they can borrow money on the strength of existing stock on their balance sheets and use that to buy new stock.  I would welcome this type of innovative model and it could be looked upon as a sensible way to leverage up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>There was one question that was not answered about increasing the Part V element of the 20,000 units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#X00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I said that our debtors and receivers have the same legal obligations as non-NAMA debtors and they would say to us that they are not going to be disadvantaged <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the non-NAMA debtors; that they would have to provide more than 10% because it would affect the profitability of their schemes and therefore in trying to maximise the repayments of their debt.

There is great demand in Dublin 15 where we have a massive housing crisis.  However, there are two NAMA housing estates which are building on rare land that is left in the area; Hamilton Park and Diswellstown Manor have NAMA involvement.  The minimum price of those three bedroom units is &euro;410,000 and &euro;395,000.  I checked the prices two days ago, if they have changed then Mr. McDonagh could let me know.

I do not know about the prices in other areas, and I would be interested in hearing from Deputies in those areas, but in Dublin, what are the prices of these houses and how will they ever do anything to help anyone involved in the housing crisis?  There is a way NAMA could house between 50,000 and 100,000 people right now.  NAMA could wipe out the social housing list in this country, if its brief was changed.  I am not blaming the three witnesses here today because it is the Government that decides the brief.  However, in an answer to a parliamentary question, and on one of the pages of his presentation Mr. Daly confirms this, it was stated that NAMA has a claim over 2,800 ha of residential land in the country, for example, 1,100 ha in Dublin and 620 ha in Cork.  These are two of the biggest problem areas for the housing crisis.  If NAMA built social and affordable houses on those hectares of land in Dublin, for example, with 1,100 ha at, say, 50 houses per hectare, it could house 55,000 people.  The brief of NAMA is run along profit lines, bailing out developers and getting loans repaid for the State.  However, if its brief was changed, it has enough land already zoned and, if emergency legislation was introduced, we could build houses quite quickly on it.<\/p><p>The other issue is the hoarding of land which NAMA has been involved in.  It is not just me saying it.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said it in replies to parliamentary questions.  It was not until 2014 that NAMA started releasing land for housing.  Meanwhile, the housing crisis was building up and NAMA had all this land.  It is, therefore, about time that there was an honest discussion about the role the previous and current Governments, in setting up NAMA, have played in allowing housing to become very scarce.  For example, in a housing forum last month, NAMA said it had sold enough land for 20,500 units since 2014 &quot;in the most sought-after areas of the capital, the commuter counties of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth and the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway&quot;.  At the height of the housing crisis and in the areas where the crisis is worse, NAMA has sold enough land for those units.  By the way, only 1,100 units have been built on that land, indicating developers have been hoarding land while waiting for house prices and profits to rise. <\/p><p>That is the key problem.  The private sector is in control of housing in this country and it is being facilitated by NAMA as it is currently set up.  I would argue NAMA encourages developers to hoard land and it let a housing shortage develop.  I do not have time to give all the quotes.  However, for example, a report on a freedom of information request in <i>The Irish Independent<\/i>last month shows that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, wrote to NAMA saying it must bring land to market more quickly to stop developers hoarding sites.  He went on to say that NAMA was contributing to the problem.  Why was that decision taken when even the Minister himself had to intervene?  <\/p><p>On the social housing spend to date and that projected in the NAMA wind-up, NAMA brags about the &euro;260 million it contributed to social housing but it had a turnover of &euro;34 billion.  That is the problem; it is so minuscule.  Why has so little been spent on new social housing?  I know NAMA's primary aim is financial return.  There seems to be no social element to NAMA whatsoever.  Is NAMA making the decision that there is not much of a social element or is it the Government ordering it?  We need to know that.  Of the remaining money NAMA has, I think it has &euro;3 billion in cash at the moment, or it had recently.  Will the witnesses clarify the position?  If that was even used now, at this very late stage, for affordable and social housing, it would make a huge in-road into the problem.<\/p><p> The next question is about NAMA's connection to vulture funds.  Today, the NAMA representatives denied that the agency sold 90% of its stock to vulture funds.  I am not talking about housing alone.  If we include land and all of the loans, then 90% was sold to vulture funds, as far as I can see.<\/p><p> The NAMA representatives have also said that the existing tenancy arrangements tend not to be impacted.  I offer an example of an apartment block in Clontarf that NAMA sold to Grant Thornton, which was acting as receiver.  The receiver immediately went about imposing a 25% rent increase on the tenants last year.  The tenants challenged this at the Private Residential Tenancies Board and have been doing so ever since.  Do the NAMA representatives not believe the agency should have some kind of conscience about who it sells to and what lease arrangements are going to be put in place?  Does NAMA have any policy of maintaining affordable rents when it sells on apartment complexes or houses?  Some of these apartments are still empty because, it would seem, they were being held on to.  Apparently, part of the reason is that the loans on the apartments are in the process of being sold to a vulture fund, Promontoria (Arrow), as part of NAMA's Project Arrow deal.  The units in question are in Bay Apartments in Clontarf.  No one living in those apartments was informed by NAMA that they had been sold on or that the tenants now had a new landlord.  The first residents heard about it was on 28 April, when they got a letter telling them about it and asking for information on the lease arrangements they had in place, etc.<\/p><p> One would have thought NAMA should not be contributing to rent increases, but by selling to vulture funds that is inevitable.  Most of these vulture funds pay no tax whatsoever in this country.  Apparently, one of them paid &euro;250 tax in 2014 despite holding over &euro;500 million in assets.  The fund in question is Beltany Property Finance, which is related to Goldman Sachs.<\/p><p> The last question relates to write-downs to developers.  They impact on the money available to use for social and affordable housing.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance tabled a parliamentary question on 14 April.  As of 31 March, 442 of NAMA's original 779 debtor connections had exited the NAMA process.  These 442 debtors owed &euro;18.5 billion but they only paid &euro;9.6 billion, or half of it.  Only 44 debtors have paid their debts in full to NAMA, which means that between them almost 400 debtors have effectively had an &euro;8.9 billion write-off of debt from NAMA, with an average write-off of &euro;24 million per developer.  Do the NAMA representatives believe that it is acceptable, when people are struggling with mortgages, for many of these developers to have profited handsomely from these deals or that they should be let off so easily?  It seems only one in 20 NAMA developers have paid their debts in full.  It is great to hear that NAMA is going to meet its targets ahead of time, but do the agency representatives not believe there has been undue haste in getting rid of assets and lands with no care as to who they are going to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#Y00400","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We will afford Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh an opportunity to respond.

I have already spoken about these in response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.  Short of repeating myself, we have to act in accordance with the mandate and the responsibilities in the NAMA Act.  We cannot go outside that.  We have to get the best financial return we can for the taxpayer and to do that as expeditiously as possible - that is in the Act as well.<\/p><p>That is a primary driver for us.<\/p><p> I know the Deputy will probably not agree with me but our view is that the repayment of the debt is a priority for all sorts of other reasons.  Only when we are sure we can do that can we invest money in other things, like social housing, ghost estates and the funding of 20,000 units.  Whether the Deputy thinks that is adequate is not the point.  For NAMA, we cannot do any of that until we are sure we are generating the cash to repay our debt and have enough cash to fund that.  The housing programme we are going to fund will cost approximately &euro;5 billion.  The Docklands development we are going to fund will cost approximately &euro;2 billion.  We will do all of that.  We will repay the debt and we will return a surplus to the State. <\/p><p> To respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s central point, we cannot really do that unless we operate commercially and unless we deal with the investors who are prepared to buy our assets.  The Deputy labels them vulture funds, but other people would call them investment companies.  There will be others; there are private individuals and Irish investors.  We put everything on the market and we take the best price we can, generally speaking.  Unless we do that, we are not acting commercially; we are departing from our brief and are open to challenge by our debtors and receivers and will not get the wherewithal to do what we propose to do in housing, in the Docklands or anything else.  That is the responsibility the NAMA Act places on us.  I know the Deputy has a different view but that is a policy view, which is beyond our remit here today. <\/p><p> There were a lot of questions about individual sites and I will leave those to Mr. McDonagh.  Deputy Coppinger said NAMA has been hoarding land.  She is quite right that we have 2,800 hectares of residential development land but 1,500 of those are earmarked to deliver the 20,000 houses.  That leaves approximately 1,300 hectares.  Not all of that will ever be built on because it is not suitable.  It is not zoned and is not in the right area.  We are not hoarding it.  We continually look through it.  If there are local authorities interested in some of that land for residential development, or whatever, we are quite happy to talk to them about it.  They know what we have and I am not sure that in that 1,300 acres, which we do not think is viable, there is the potential that the Deputy says is there.  Maybe it will become viable in the future.<\/p><p> The amount of cash we have on hand varies from time to time.  Whatever cash we have is earmarked to repay the debt and we have to repay more this year, for the housing development, the Docklands and other things we do and to pay our own way because we do not borrow.  The question about the apartment blocks in Clontarf is so specific that I am not sure we can answer it today.  Maybe Mr. McDonagh has some information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Some of the land our debtors have across the portfolio is in good locations where house prices are higher than the norm but that is the market.

We wanted to get money on the portfolio straightaway.  If it could not be sold to the market, we told our debtors and receivers to get people in to rent it.  They let as much as they could and the residual amount of 6,500 was offered to the local authorities when they and the housing agency approached us.

As of today, the cash balance is about &euro;2.4 billion and we have another &euro;2 billion in bond redemptions this year.  We need money to fund the various developments in which we are involved.  She referred to a specific scheme in Clontarf but I do not have the detail on that.  It is not up to NAMA to write to tenants because we are a secured lender.  Bank of Ireland, AIB or Ulster Bank would not write to tenants.  It is the owners of properties who write to tenants.  If a receiver was in place, he or she would be in the shoes of the owner and have to deal with tenants.  I do not have the detail with me on whether schemes are part of NAMA.

I understand the answer stated that &euro;1.6 billion of par debt has been written off.  The reality is that where a debtor has borrowed money, sold all the assets and given up any other assets to the maximum extent possible, that is what will be realised.  The problem is that the debtors who came into NAMA had borrowed &euro;74 billion from the banks.  When we bought the assets from the banks, they were only worth &euro;26 billion.  We ended up paying the banks &euro;31 billion, which was &euro;5.6 billion more than what they were worth at the time because that was what the Government wanted.  It was State aid and we have had to work to claw back the overpayment of &euro;5.6 billion and now generate a surplus.<\/p> <p>  We would love to be in a position to say today that we bought a &euro;74 billion portfolio for &euro;32 billion and have been able to sell it for &euro;74 billion but that is not the reality.

The loans we inherited were secured on sites that had no planning or planning that simply could not be delivered.  They were in areas that required new local area plans, county development plans or new STZs.  From 2010 to 2012, NAMA worked with debtors and local authorities to try to secure planning.<\/p><p>We have a land strategy in place for every single hectare of land within the portfolio.  The units that we are now delivering are the by-product of the planning work that was done.  We do not work as was previously the case under the model.  We work on a cluster basis with local authorities.  We go in with local authorities and identify contiguous land, neighbouring land, what needs to happen first and whether it is this side or that side.  I understand Deputy Coppinger's point, but, to be fair, there was a large proportion of development land inherited that required a huge amount of intensive asset management and planning work to get it to where it is today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>When we acquired the portfolio at the very start, our debtors controlled less than 30% of the development land in Dublin.

There is 99% occupancy in them at present and the other 1% represents people moving in and out as they come to the end of their leases.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the Dublin docklands.  The SDZ was proposed and adopted by Dublin City Council.  It went to the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Deputy is correct that NAMA debtors had 75% of the land in that area.  The policy decision was for 3.8 million sq. ft. of commercial office space and 2,000 apartments.  That was the policy decision and not NAMA's decision.  The Part V obligation meant that 10% of that would become social housing units.  That obligation must be complied with.  The issue of whether Dublin City Council wants more units than that is always up for discussion.  They would have to buy them at market value or whatever the case may be.  That is the reality.<\/p><p> The Deputy also raised the question of NAMA hotels.  There are 31 hotels left in NAMA and they are all operating so there are no vacant ones.  Project Jewel was also raised, as was Moore Street.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht bought a certain site on Moore Street as part of the preparations for an historic monument.  The plan is for a rejuvenation of the area, including a shopping centre.  A certain amount of residential units are planned for that but it will be for the new owners, a major UK plc, to decide on that in conjunction with the debtor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#CC01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Given the forum we are in, I am far more interested in what NAMA is going to do in the future than in what it did in the past.  Mr. McDonagh said NAMA paid approximately &euro;32 billion for assets that were worth approximately &euro;5 billion less.  I do not dispute the claim that they were worth no more than &euro;25 billion but when NAMA was set up, the idea was not to flood the market with assets at fire sale prices, which would have meant it would have been worse than what we got.  The idea was to put them into deep freeze, hold them for a while and wait for some recovery in the market.  In that context, it is a bit disingenuous to say there was always going to be some form of recovery and the value was not going to stay for ever at &euro;25 billion or &euro;32 billion.  We can argue until the cows come home about what something was worth on a particular day.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the NAMA Act and the approach of the Minister for Finance are very strongly linked to how NAMA has acted but I feel there is some room for movement.  NAMA seems to have been under great time pressure, which meant some stuff was sold at a high discount.  The decision to sell in large bundles brought in the vulture funds, or investment funds as NAMA prefers to call them, and they have distorted the market dramatically.  An example I have given many times is the two-bedroom apartments in Dominick Street, which were &euro;900 per month and are now &euro;1,500 because a small group of big players, investment funds from abroad, are having a big impact on the market.<\/p> <p>  How much autonomy has NAMA had when making decisions on what to sell, and when and where?  How much of a role has the Minister for Finance had in its decision-making?  Was NAMA told, \"There is the NAMA Act and there are the rules, so away with you\"?  NAMA wrote a letter to the Minister on 28 September 2015, which included the following, \"At our meeting with you on 15 September you requested that the NAMA board assess the increased contribution that NAMA could make to residential delivery if it were to be given a new mandate to maximise the delivery of housing in the period to end-2020.\"  I accept that the Minister for Finance only started to talk about a new mandate in September 2015.  NAMA wrote back to him, stating, \"During the meeting you stated your endorsement of the board's objective of redeeming all senior debt by 2018 and the repayment of subordinated debt in March 2020 and you indicated that, in your view, achievement of these senior and subordinated debt repayment targets should take precedence over the provision of funding that would be required for NAMA residential projects in any revised strategy.\"<\/p><p>Am I to understand that NAMA has been strongly dictated to by the Minister for Finance, or am I misreading that?<br\/><br\/>My second question relates to delivery of the 20,000 units.  NAMA has brought a new dimension into it by linking the role of the debtor in that.  It is more or less saying that the debtor cannot be treated differently from anybody else, but I would have thought it might have more flexibility on that, or perhaps I am wrong.  The land concerned is approximately 1,500 ha.  If Brussels will not allow NAMA to deliver in the region of 30% social housing units from that<b><\/b>because of state aid rules, is there a mechanism whereby that land could go back to the State and it could carry out the delivery of that project?  Is there any way around the state aid challenge to address the problem?  Even though social housing provision has probably never gone higher than 15% in the State, realistically, 30% of the people who will be looking for housing in the next 20 years will probably be depending on the State to supply it directly.  Therefore, the allocation of 10% from that pool for the supply of social housing is way below demand.  <br\/><br\/>Added to that is the price of &euro;300,000 for a house.  I am sure the representatives realise that the people who have the most difficulty gaining access to housing have no hope on earth of coming up with that kind of money.  Are they factoring into that price the cost of the land on which NAMA is sitting?  Are they also factoring into that price a profit margin for NAMA?<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the Dublin Docklands strategic development zone, SDZ, which Deputy O'Sullivan also raised, SDZs are obviously very convenient for NAMA to work with.  It is predominantly commercially orientated.  I  can understand the logic behind it.  The location suits commercial property, but there is also a dire need for residential units in that area.  I am fairly convinced that it was not NAMA but the planners in Dublin City Council that made the call that the Dublin Docklands SDZ area would be dominated by commercial property.  Had NAMA any say in that matter?<br\/><br\/>Mr. McDonagh mentioned the cost of labour in construction and said that it had not changed much over the years.  I employed a few hundred people, and most of them are still involved in construction in Ireland.  The general worker is taking home a lot less than he was and the subcontractors are still working for crazy rates, and there is a big problem there.  The guy who is doing the work on the site is making a lot less than he was.  Anyone who tells Mr. McDonagh otherwise is being economical with the truth.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Daly made the point that the biggest social dividend would be obtained by paying back the debt as soon as possible, and he went on to say that repayment of the debt was a priority.  Is that not a political statement also?  He started off by saying that he was not going to go into the political area.<\/p><p>How we spend our money and how soon we pay down debt is important but if I am correct, we are taking about a debt in the region of 1%.  I know there are people in Europe who would like us to pay down that debt as early as possible but at the same time there is some flexibility in that regard.  I see all the countries across Europe availing of certain flexibilities in terms of strong bodies in Europe.  It seems irrational to be in a rush to pay down debt that is costing 1% given the huge pressures created by the emergency around housing.  Do the witnesses agree there is a political dimension to that statement?  I am not saying there is a great deal of flexibility but there must be some options in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#DD00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I might take the Deputy's second and last questions and link them, if that is appropriate.  Deputy Wallace asked if we are under time pressure, how much autonomy we have, etc.  We are an independent board.  Our mandate is the Act.  We do engage with the Minister from time to time, and it would be wrong of us not to do so.  Generally, we would have a review of our strategy every year.  Sometimes he would come along to that and engage with us but at the end of the day the strategy for NAMA, by and large, is that of the board, and we can talk about that right from the beginning.<\/p> <p>  The strategy was to not dump assets on the Irish market in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  That would have only done more damage to a fragile market.  That market was recovering in 2013 and NAMA was getting more active in the Irish market; in the earlier years being very active in the United Kingdom market, which has been quite good to us in terms of realising our assets in the UK; and all of that feeding into our capacity to repay debt and invest in housing or the docklands.  That is the strategic policy of NAMA set by the NAMA board.  I certainly will not deny that we would engage with the Minister from time to time but he has not directed us in any particular area; he has left it to us.  We can all argue about whether it was the broadly right strategic approach along the way, but we are convinced it was the right approach.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that part of that is our focus on paying down the debt.  I am not talking about the wider issue of debt repayment in the State, which certainly would get me into a political area, and I am not making a political statement when I say that NAMA's priority is to repay its debt.  I and my board colleagues believe that that contingent liability is a drag on the State and that until NAMA has it paid off, it will remain there and it could impact on Ireland's standing in the financial markets or whatever.  That is our strategy, and we are well advanced on that.  We are probably two years ahead of target and we will have that senior debt, and it is the senior debt that is the contingent liability, repaid by 2018.  All of that is a strategy devised by the NAMA board, continually reviewed by the NAMA board and based on whatever expert input we can get from the Executive or external experts.  It is our strategy.  I am not making a political statement when I say that we regard debt repayment as a priority.  I am saying that is the NAMA strategy and that is the view of the board of NAMA, and the Minister has not put us under great time pressure or anything like that.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's final point on the biggest social dividend, I still believe it is to repay the debt and along the way we are generating enough cash, thankfully, to invest in housing and in the docklands.<\/p><p>The Deputy raised another issue about state aid and social housing.  State aid is not really the barrier in terms of social housing.  The state aid issue arises with regard to the plans of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, to build 20,000 private houses for the market.  The state aid concern of Brussels lies more there than in whether we offer, as we have, 6,000 houses for social use.  That is not an issue that concerns Brussels too much.<\/p><p> As for the docklands SDZ, the Deputy referred to the decision that there would be just 2,000 residential units -  the same point was made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan - and asked who had made that decision.  It was made in the context of the designation of the SDZ, around which there was wide consultation.  Any interested parties had the option of making an input to that process and we did as well.  I believe the Deputy acknowledges that the anchor programme in the docklands probably is prime commercial office space, which is badly needed in the central business district in Dublin.  Perhaps Mr. McDonagh has some other points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace raised some other questions.  He spoke of how there will be an increased reliance on the State to provide housing in the future and so on, and I do not disagree with him in that regard.  The business model by which people try to acquire their homes might be changing and more people might be moving towards renting and things like that.  Obviously, as the cost of housing increases, it becomes more difficult for people to get mortgages or to be able to afford it.  The Deputy is correct that under the Central Bank rules, at present, one needs a deposit of &euro;38,000 for a &euro;300,000 house, which is a big deposit.  Our debtors are telling us that in the schemes they have launched, people are telling them that while they really like the house, they are &euro;10,000 short.  They then return the following week to say their brother, sister or father will lend them &euro;5,000 but they are still &euro;5,000 short and so on.  People really want to buy those houses but are caught by the Central Bank rules.  I am aware that this issue is being reviewed by the Central Bank later this year and, like everything, while it might be good in principle, I have been stating repeatedly that calibration is an important point in this regard.  In my view, &euro;220,000 is a very low level for a 10% deposit, but that is a matter for the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the docklands and the Chairman referred to the 2,000 units.  That decision started off with the chief executive of Dublin City Council and the council ultimately adopted it.  The Deputy also spoke of the value of assets and what they were at that point in time.  As I stated, the reality is we should only have paid &euro;26 billion for them but ended up paying &euro;32 billion for them to the banks.  Thereafter, the market dropped by another 30%, so they probably were only worth &euro;22 billion at one stage.  Consequently, there has been a big turnaround in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised an issue with regard to the cost of labour, and I do not disagree with him.  However, I simply make the point that I also talk to a lot of people who are saying that with registered employment contracts, the cost of labour still is a big issue.  I accept that people can have different views but all I am saying is what I am hearing.

I thank Mr. McDonagh for his outline.  Is the cost of building apartments different?  If so, is there any chance of getting that information?  Yesterday, we went to see modular housing in Ballymun and I have to say that I was impressed.  Cherry Orchard, which is in my constituency, is one of a number of sites designated for modular housing.  The biggest problem we heard about yesterday in the context of building modular housing and existing residents does not relate to the actual houses themselves but rather to the tenants who are going to occupy them going into them.  In general, local authorities need to tackle that end of things as well.  In the past, they have not been able to deal with anti-social behaviour on the part of their own tenants, not to mention private ones.  That has been a real downfall on the part of councils.  If they dealt with that, people would be more accepting of having certain individuals move into their areas.  It is shameful that those to whom I refer are not accepted.  My family and I have all lived in social housing.  I am surprised that people do not want social housing back in areas where our children want to live.  I wanted to make that off-the-cuff comment because I really believe that a social mix is important in the context of every site.

The figures we published are not unreasonable.  Those costs are for building a house.  The cost of building apartments is much higher.  Apartments really only work in high-density areas.  That is something I would support.  The revised regulations in terms of apartments have certainly been helpful.  It is not necessarily about the minimum size of apartments because the planning applications we see going in are all for apartments that are bigger than the minimum standards.  The real game changer has been the number of cores.  That actually allows one to build a better engineered scheme.  There are huge sunk costs in apartments which are not necessary, certainly in the city centre.  People who live in apartments generally do not want car spaces.  What they want are bicycle sheds and perhaps a small gym.  We have been involved in some schemes in London which do not have car spaces at all.  It dramatically reduces the cost by avoiding the need to put something underground.

Many of our members are well known; others, less so.  The network provides the full range of specialist services, supports and accommodation types in Dublin, while several member organisations provide services around the country.  The network works closely with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, which has one operational plan covering the four local authority areas of Dublin.  We four representatives here sit on the statutory Dublin Joint Homelessness Consultative Forum and Management Group, as well as the implementation advisory group in the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.<\/p> <p>  The committee is well aware that by any measure Ireland&rsquo;s housing and homeless situation has reached crisis point.  The homeless crisis affects the entire country and is acute in Dublin.  Housing supply is significantly below housing need.  The private rented sector has contracted at a time when demand has surged forward, with a consequent increases in rents.  People who were never homeless must now live with their families in hotels.  We will never have a truly thriving economy without a functioning housing market.  <\/p> <p>  Homelessness in Dublin falls into two clear parts.<\/p><p>The first consists of the new homeless who, tragically, find themselves living with their children in hotel rooms and individuals living in temporary emergency accommodation.  Often these people are working and, generally, have no previous experience of the factors traditionally leading to homelessness.  Many of the new homeless have the skills to live independently and are now homeless principally due to housing affordability reasons.  With support, affordable housing and a properly functioning social housing regime and private rented market, we believe they can live independently again.  If they access the homes they need, the level of specialist support from our type of organisations should be limited.  <\/p><p> The second category consists of those individuals and households whose life experiences often put them on a trajectory that includes homelessness.  Homelessness is symptomatic of other life events resulting in complex needs.  All of us, including our family members, friends or neighbours, at some time in our lives can experience factors that can lead to homelessness.  The members of the Dublin Homeless Network are committed to respecting the dignity of every individual and working to support those with complex needs.  Many of those who are homeless have come from a background of grinding poverty and chaotic home lives.  Often they have been taken into the care of the State as children.  Many have been victims of violence and domestic abuse, some are caught in a trap of substance addiction, many have a poor experience of the education system and lack the marketable skills to provide for themselves and others have mental and physical disabilities.  <\/p><p> Much of the work of the 16 homeless organisations that make up the network involves the professional delivery of care and structured support using needs analysis, agreed care plans and case working for people with complex needs affected by or at risk of homelessness.  This helps those people, most of whom have dual diagnoses, to access and engage successfully with external specialist medical services.  We are focused on empowering people to provide the varying level of supports they need so that they can go on to live independently.  We support the comprehensive development in Ireland of the Housing First model of accommodation with wraparound supports in a way that has been proven internationally to address the complex needs of homelessness successfully.  <\/p><p> Our submission identifies many detailed factors relating to homelessness and specific recommendations under four categories.  These are prevention, which involves ceasing the flow into homelessness; emergency accommodation; access to housing; and keeping people who move out of homelessness in housing.  I will hand over to Mr. David Carroll, who is our vice chair and who will briefly take the committee through our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#UU00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before the committee.

Our first recommendation relates to housing advice and advocacy.

A 15% increase in rent supplement is inadequate in the current climate.  The majority of increases in rent supplement secured by Threshold for Tenancy Protection Service clients were at least 20%, with 150 clients given increases of more than 40%.  Rent needs to be looked at a local level.  The rent on a two-bedroom house in Dublin 2 is &euro;1,668, while the rent on a two-bedroom house in Dublin 15 is &euro;1,101.  We also think that effective rent regulation is the only way to address ongoing unaffordable rent increases.  Rent certainty measures linking future rent increases to the consumer price index should be introduced.<\/p> <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, needs to be extended nationwide along with the HAP place finder service, which has been very successful in Dublin.

Placement is the way we assess people and ensure they have an exit from homelessness.  These are required for single people, couples and families.  We urgently require additional emergency accommodation.  While cold weather facilities were opened for the six months of the winter period, they are closing.  Sleeping rough is an option during the summer months and it is not a human right to have a bed for the night during the summer months.<\/p> <p>  The Br&uacute; emergency accommodation facility has gained attention in recent weeks.  Last night Br&uacute; had 58 empty beds with a full staff team.  I understand from colleagues that the Dublin freephone service refused 90 people due to lack of emergency accommodation.  This is not just an issue of the Br&uacute; Aimsir facility.  Emergency facilities are required across the city in order to respond to the increasing numbers of people coming into homeless accommodation.  People coming into homeless accommodation have very complex needs.  HSE budgets must be restored to 2010 levels because we require urgent medical facilities to be provided on site to people experiencing complex medical needs.  While access to emergency provision is required, our goal is to get out of the business of providing emergency accommodation.  We do not want people to live in emergency accommodation permanently.  We want them to have access to housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Our third theme is access to housing.  We deal with some of the most vulnerable households and people in the country and the city.  One of our most significant challenges is obtaining housing and gateways into housing in the community.  As Ms Barry outlined, it is not our intention to keep people in temporary accommodation for the rest of their lives.  Housing and housing-led approaches are key to solving homelessness for these vulnerable groups.  People who are homeless must be prioritised as having the greatest social housing need and priority must be given to long-term homeless households.  The supply of units to accommodate different household types must be provided.  The committee is dealing with this in other sessions.<\/p> <p>  A review of the local authority and approved housing body selection and allocation schemes must occur.  The review must take into account estate management, treatment of local authority arrears, local authorities' refusal to accept housing applications and the allocation policies of approved housing bodies.  In this section, we are focusing on the under 25s.  We passionately state that single, independent people under the age of 25 have the same housing needs and costs as those aged over 25.  Therefore, the full social welfare payment should be restored to the under 25s.<\/p> <p>  Our final theme is keeping people who move out of homelessness in housing.  Our organisations do a remarkable job, even during the current crisis, to ensure people move out of temporary accommodation into the community.<\/p><p>A recently established concept which is internationally recognised, Housing First, ensures housing is provided first.  The provision of wraparound supports in conjunction with it is a key solution in working with vulnerable groups.  We, therefore, call for Housing First programmes which have proved successful in tackling long-term homelessness.  They require available housing and wraparound support services.  There is a need for increased investment in these programmes and a wider focus on specific groups, including young people.  There also needs to be a focus on how to obtain more suitable tenancies for Housing First purposes.<\/p><p> Support to Live Independently, SLI, is an existing service model.  It is a community support for people who move back into the community from temporary accommodation.  SLI-type supports need to be tailored and extended to need and linked with tenancy sustainment services in a continuum within the community.<\/p><p> Our final recommendation relates to individuals whose health has deteriorated so much that they require supported accommodation.  In many cases, this will be for the remainder of their lives.  Consideration needs to be given to the long-term care needs of homeless persons with complex health issues.  As those living in long-term accommodation units continue to age, consideration needs to be given to how to support them as their health diminishes.  An increase in such accommodation provision is needed, together with an increase in the health services provided for such units.  A definitive pathway into nursing home or palliative care for those whose health has deteriorated seriously is also required.  It is a major travesty that homeless individuals with nursing home needs find it hugely difficult to access nursing home care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#WW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an deis teacht chun labhairt leis.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Cork Social Housing Forum, CSHF.  I am assistant director of Cork Simon Community.  The forum comprises 19 organisations in the voluntary sector.  Groups in the statutory sector have recently sought membership, which is indicative of the challenges staff in mental health services and so forth face in trying to decant people from acute hospitals and other facilities into housing.  We believe access to housing is a basic human right, as well as a human need.  There is quite a mix in the spectrum of politicians before us.  We all agree that the most vulnerable citizens in society find themselves in difficult circumstances.  There are single people and families comprising women and children.  There is huge motivation to drive this process forward to come up with a strategy to deal with all of their needs and ensure nobody will be left behind.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues from Dublin have mentioned many of the issues involved.  Therefore, I will not go through my full submission.  We are faced with a huge crisis and the human cost to the most vulnerable of citizens is inestimable.  In many respects, as a society, we will pay a price for this long into the future as we will have to continue to deal with it.  There is a major imperative on us to find solutions to problems that have their roots in the lack of a social housing programme for many years.  We are paying a price for this every day.  Coupled with this, we have experienced the economic collapse.  When the issue is examined from the perspective of those providing homeless services and attempting to provide move-on accommodation for people, every system is under huge pressure, with some bursting at the seams.  Since 2011 Cork Simon Community has experienced a ninefold increase in the number of people sleeping rough.<\/p><p>That is from 38 people who slept rough one night or more in 2011 to 345 in 2015.  That is indicative of the change that has come about in the intervening period.<\/p><p> This needs to be about solutions and we need to find immediate wins to deal with some of the issues that exist.  One of those, which was outlined earlier, is to prevent people from falling into the system as it is.  We must do everything we can in terms of bank foreclosures and people who find themselves unable to pay the rent because it has gone beyond their ability to pay.  Those issues need to be dealt with.  No one should be allowed to become homeless simply because of the gap between their income and what is requested from the landlords.  It simply should not happen.  It is a false economy not to pay it in the short term.  By doing that, we are pushing more people into services that already cannot cope with what they are dealing with.  We need to get a bit real about what we are doing here and how we do it.  When we deal with the issues here, we need to deal not only with the immediate issues but ensure whatever we do makes a huge positive contribution to the long-term solutions we need to find.  They need to be sustainable because it is about building communities as much as it is about building houses.<\/p><p> One of the things we need to do in terms of any housing strategy in future is to avoid the mistakes of the past.  That should be a principle that underpins any housing strategy in future.  We can no longer depend on the market to provide.  The solution to homelessness and housing is about looking at a suite of different responses.  The market has proven that it cannot provide and we need to look at other solutions.  The idea that we can depend on the private market to solve these problems is long past its sell-by date.<\/p><p> In terms of some of the more short-term responses, rental properties are just out of the range of people who are on low incomes, so rents need to be capped.  It is important to have some independent and external objective criteria, for example, to link it to the consumer price index, in order that at least people's incomes would match what is expected in terms of what they pay in the rental market.  The most immediate thing that can be done is to increase rent caps to stem the flow into homelessness in the short term.  We can do that and we need to do it.  We do not have a choice and doing nothing is not an option.<\/p><p> The most acute aspect of homelessness is sleeping rough.  Those who are long-term homeless also need to be prioritised for housing.  There is a really good reason for that, which is that they disproportionately hold up beds in emergency accommodation throughout the State.  Moving them on will free up beds that will allow us at least to try to bring in those who are sleeping rough at present.  It is not easily done because we are dealing with individuals, many of whom have very complex needs.  No two needs are the same in many respects but there are commonalities.  The Housing First approach has been proven internationally - by Pathways in New York, right across Europe, in Finland and other countries - to have a huge impact in terms of moving people who would previously have been thought of as very difficult to house.  It has been a success in over 80% of cases in many countries.  It is not just about housing but also about the supports for people with complex issues of mental health, addiction, dual diagnoses and so forth.  We need to be very focused on the fact it is not just about families or single people but about both.  We need to be sure nobody is left behind.  That is really important.<\/p><p> The other quick-fix solution that could at least deal with some of the issues is to address the voids in local authorities.  In some cases it is taking up to 12 months to turn a house around, which is something that needs to be looked at.  New targets need to be set for the turnover of these houses and the obstacles that are faced by tearing out the insides of houses, replacing them and putting them back the way they were.  These things need to be looked at and we need to be very practical in how we deal with this.  We are talking about people's lives so we need to look at what we can deliver for people and we should always look for something that we would be satisfied to take for ourselves.<\/p><p> The other resources of the State and the local authorities also need to be marshalled, and this includes NAMA.  The remit of NAMA has primarily been to deliver for the Exchequer but there are two ways in which one can deliver: one can deliver for the Exchequer in monetary terms but one can also deliver a social dividend.  In our view, the social dividend has not been delivered to the extent it should have been in terms of supporting social housing provision for the State.  The vulture funds are basically selling off the assets they have bought from NAMA.  If necessary, the Government should seek to CPO those assets in order to stop people becoming homeless.  We have to stop that flow and look at what NAMA can deliver.  I believe there is much about NAMA we do not know and there is certainly more it can do in regard to becoming a greater part of the solution than it is at present.<\/p><p> In recent years, certainly since 2008, there has been a huge cut in supports and resources for both the voluntary and the statutory services, many of which are struggling to cope.  Capacity has been lost and, in some of the local authority areas, corporate memory has been lost.  The resulting deficits need to be addressed because, if we are going to deal with a house building programme, which is what we are advocating, we need the people in place who can deliver that.  Those resource issues need to be dealt with.<\/p><p> We need to treat this as the national crisis that it is.  There should be no shirking from using the mechanisms available to the Government and local authorities, such as compulsory purchase orders or Part 8 planning, to speed up the delivery of housing.  There are also other resources which are within the gift of some of the local authorities.  There are derelict sites and housing that are not currently being used.  I am led to believe that in Cork, the local authorities know where these are and who owns them.  I believe this would speed up the delivery of social housing.  We should maximise the ability of the local authorities and the voluntary sector, working in consultation and conjunction with each other, to effectively and as quickly as possible deliver any of the units this might leverage.<\/p><p> Let us be clear: social housing is the key to solving this problem in the long term.  Whatever we do in the short term, we need to provide social housing.  There is an imbalance in terms of what is being provided at the moment.  In 2004, 10% of the provision was by private rent and it is now 20%.  The private rented sector is in difficulty and we need to deal with that end of it.  However, we also need to look at provision by the local authorities and the social housing providers.  We need to use the resources they currently have, so there is in-house capacity to design and develop housing within the social housing providers.  If it is not there in the local authorities, then we need to lean on them.  Everybody needs to be part of the solution.<\/p><p> In the long term, a State-sponsored house building programme needs to be led by the local authorities and, it is important to say, this needs to be done in partnership, with everybody working together.  This is a shared problem and we have shared responsibilities.  In the immediate term, housing acquisition is a short-term solution but the finances need to be provided to allow the local authorities to purchase units that are available and ready for immediate occupancy.  This is one of the key things they can do in the short term.<\/p><p> The problem is huge but it is not insurmountable.  It is not beyond the talents, commitment and motivation of people in this room and the services that are out there, be they statutory or voluntary.  We just need the will to do it.  We need to prioritise this as an issue in terms of resource provision.  Co-operation is going to be one of the key issues and cross-departmental and inter-agency buy-in is critical.  In some cases, those of us within the system are working against each other in many different ways and we make things very difficult in regard to HAP and all the other things we do.<\/p><p>We need to simplify what we do and make it easy for people to navigate the system and to know about HAP, what it is, etc.  We really need to get to grips by making it simple.  We are making it hard for each other and nobody has either the time or the resources to be wasting time on things that could be easily dealt with, some of which are mentioned in the full submission.<\/p><p> It has to be led by somebody and that person should be the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What is done should be planned, with clear objectives, specific targets and timeframes for delivery.  Teams must be tasked to deliver and there is a need for decision makers with authority who will overcome the inevitable challenges that will emerge from many different sectors and positions.  They must deliver housing as quickly as possible.  We can do that but we need to do it while meeting the requisite standards and do it in a transparent and accountable way.  We should all be accountable.  It is public money.  It belongs to the people and should be spent particularly for the most vulnerable of our citizens.  We need that can-do attitude.  We really must get to grips with that.  We need to know that we can solve the problem.  It is huge and very difficult but it can be done.  Families and single people are in crisis and they are depending on us to deliver for them.  That is a huge responsibility.  It is a shared responsibility.  It is a responsibility for all of us.  We need to be very practical in what we do and how we do it.  No stone should be left unturned in terms of this delivery.  The time for action is now and we should not leave anyone behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>My name is Tr&iacute;ona O'Connor and I am currently the project leader with Focus Ireland in Limerick.  We cover Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, but I am here today in my capacity as the chairperson of the Limerick Homeless Alliance and the Clare Homeless Alliance.  Both are separate alliances which meet separately in Limerick and Clare, and I happen to have the job of chairing both.<\/p> <p>  The Limerick Homeless Alliance and the Clare Homeless Alliance welcome the establishment of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness and its short, focused approach to identifying solutions to a crisis that is impacting on so many families and individuals.  We really appreciate the opportunity to speak today.<\/p> <p>  Homelessness is a complex problem with both economic and social causes.  It is frequently about much more than a housing problem but it always includes a housing problem.  Every exit from homelessness requires a house.  Other supports are often needed, but housing is paramount.  This submission takes its lead from the committee's agenda and therefore concentrates on housing.  It is important to note that in order for homelessness to be effectively tackled, a broad range of measures are needed.  Just as there is recognition that the current crisis results from a lack of investment in housing, it also needs to be recognised that the lack of investment in social infrastructure, such as mental health, social work and so on, must also be reversed if we are to truly solve the problem.<\/p> <p>  Addressing homelessness requires a sustained commitment, strong principles and a clear vision of what is needed by families, communities and the society.  In its short lifespan, this committee cannot solve the full range of problems.  However, we hope that it can help to establish such principles across the political spectrum in order to sustain longer-term policy-making.  The submission concentrates on measures that can and must be initiated immediately, but in some cases their impact will be immediate and in others it will take time to come into effect.<\/p> <p>  The Homeless Alliance in Clare and Limerick is made up of all voluntary organisations in the area.  About 12 different organisations are involved in providing services in the Limerick city and county region, and in Clare it is made up of 14 organisations, both statutory and voluntary.  The alliances and all the organisations that are around the table are there to prevent single people and families from becoming homeless but also to support exits from homelessness.  Some of the barriers and solutions that we felt were relevant to name today - and we go into much more detail in the submission - are the same as those to which my colleagues have referred already.  The lack of housing supply, particularly affordable housing, is definitely a major barrier for the people with whom we work in the mid-west region.  Others are the rapidly rising rents, over-reliance on the private rental market and insufficient rent supplement levels.  We also feel that the HAPs need to be reviewed.  There is a serious lack of one-bedroom accommodation nationwide.<\/p><p>On 26 April, five one-bedroom units were available in Limerick city, the rent for which was between &euro;500 and &euro;650 while the rent supplement cap is &euro;375.<\/p><p> Insufficient capital funding results in fewer approved housing bodies providing housing units.  There is a disproportionate burden of financial risk on the approved housing bodies which, depending on their size, is a disincentive to their developing social housing units.  The reduced social welfare payments to those aged under 25 is also a barrier.  There is a huge increase in youth homelessness at present.  According to the current statistics, more than 50% of people accessing hostel accommodation in Limerick and Clare are 30 years of age and under.  This is a frightening statistic.<\/p><p> Some of the solutions we believe are relevant include a wide-scale long-term social housing building programme which, as my colleagues have said, is key.  There should be a partnership approach between the State and the approved housing bodies.  Front-loading accelerated capital advance leasing facility payments would enhance the ability of approved housing bodies to provide social housing by freeing up cashflow.  There needs to be an extension of homeless housing assistance payments outside Dublin and Cork.  It is not available anywhere else and is definitely needed in the mid-west.  There needs to be an increase in rent supplement as a preventative measure to keep families and individuals in their homes.  The statistics on one-bedroom apartments are relevant in this regard.  There is a need to recognise prevention in the Housing Act and amend section 10 in order that people can be resourced adequately to provide preventative strategies.  Rent regulation should be implemented and linked to the consumer price index, and this has been mentioned.  There should be a speedier turnaround of vacant social housing units.  As has been stated, it can take up to 12 months for a housing unit to become available.  This is not acceptable during the biggest housing crisis we have had.  More social housing should be made available throughout the country to Housing First and other housing-led projects.  We need to restore to their previous level the reduced social welfare payments to those aged under 26 who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  We need to recognise in the Constitution the right to a home.  We need to recognise the increase in youth homelessness as a very real issue nationwide.  We need better land management by the Government to prevent hoarding by NAMA and developers in areas where housing is most required, and this should include a national register of sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#AAA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tr&iacute;ona O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements and presentations.

We see today that the official homelessness figures of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are at their highest point ever, with 6,000 people, including almost 2,000 children, affected.  To put this in context, the official figures from the Department in 2008 were 1,394 people.  I know many of us disputed these, but if the official figures have shown a quadrupling at a time when the budgets of the witnesses' organisations as well as those of the local authorities and the Department have been reduced, it shows the scale of the challenge with which they work daily.<\/p> <p>  Some of my questions are specific and some of them are general and people will be able to work out which is which.  I will start with Br&uacute; Aimsir, which as people know is a 100-bed emergency hostel in Dublin.  Ms McLoughlin stated 58 beds were available last night and we know approximately 90 people were turned away by the freefone service to access these beds.  What Ms McLoughlin did not state, and I want her to confirm this for the committee, is our understanding that the hostel is to be progressively closed by the end of this month.<\/p><p>Since those people have move-on or permanent accommodation, they will not be replaced by others who become homeless.  This means that the city of Dublin will lose 100 beds by the end of this month.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses also confirm that the facility in question is ultimately owned by the State?  While it is the Digital Hub's premises, the Department of communications is responsible.  At a time when 90, or even 100 based on the last count, people were on the streets last night, the State is facilitating the closure of approximately 100 beds.  If the committee does nothing else today, we must send a clear signal to the Minister for communications to pick up the phone to the Digital Hub and say that not only should the hostel not close, but the beds should not be removed from the system.  Will the witnesses comment on this matter?<\/p><p> I share the desire to see rent supplement increased, but I have a major concern.  Under the programme for Government, there will be an increase in rent supplement and the housing assistance payment, HAP, but it does not say that there will be rent certainty or that rents will be linked to the consumer price index.  I fear that just increasing rent supplement and the HAP on their own will create an upward pressure on rents.  For people who are reliant on rent supplement and low-income families who are not eligible for rent supplement in counties where there is no HAP, this could make the situation worse.  What are the witnesses' opinions on rent certainty and its importance as a complementary measure to rent supplement increases?<\/p><p> If any of the witnesses can give the committee indications of the average length of time spent in emergency accommodation in their areas of the country, it would be useful.<\/p><p> There is a debate about people who become homeless because of the more traditional triggers that Mr. Dunne mentioned and those, in particular families, who become homeless purely as a result of the other aspects of the housing crisis.  Will the witnesses reflect on this issue?  Does it disadvantage those who are becoming homeless because of traditional triggers, that is, are they being pushed to one side even further as the public focuses on families with children and what to do in that regard?<\/p><p> The homelessness budget is &euro;70 million.  The programme for Government commits to this level of spending, but what do the witnesses believe is the real spend that is required to meet emergency accommodation needs?  It was stated that the HSE fund should be returned to 2010 levels.  What is that in money terms?<\/p><p> Will the witnesses discuss the difficulties surrounding appropriate emergency accommodation for families with children and for people with special needs?  Much of the emergency accommodation is pre-2008 and consists more of low-threshold hostels.  Hearing some information on this matter would be valuable for us.<\/p><p> I take Mr. Carroll's point about the allocation schemes and people who do not have homes getting priority.  However, prioritising those with the greatest need, including needs beyond their housing needs, for example, mental health or addiction needs, creates a difficulty for local authorities from the point of view of good and sustainable community estate management.  How should these two aspects be married?<\/p><p> Previous committee meetings heard conversations on rural-urban issues.  Most of the witnesses work in urban areas, but the committee would like to hear more from those who are not about the specific challenges facing families at risk of homelessness and in emergency accommodation in their areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#BBB00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>A range of questions have been asked.

Br&uacute; Aimsir opened as a cold weather facility for a definite time period and was due to end at the end of March, as would usually be the case for cold weather facilities.  This relates to the point on whether accommodation for a night is a human right all year round or just for a few months in the winter.  The Digital Hub Development Agency and the businesses within the Digital Hub have been phenomenally supportive of the service at every point along the way from day one.  In some of the media, they have received negative attention.<\/p> <p>  Since the facility opened in November, we have moved nearly 200 individuals who would have been sleeping rough and in the one-night-only system to more secure, stable accommodation.<\/p><p>In other words, they have been moved through the chaotic rough sleeping stage to longer term placements, be that supported temporary accommodation, temporary emergency accommodation or tenancies of their own.  Throughput at the facility has been phenomenal.  While there are currently 43 people on-site, we expect to be as successful moving them through the system, following which, one by one, the beds concerned will be closed and the lease will expire.  We have done what we were asked to do in terms of our contract, which was to move as many people as possible through the system, and the Digital Hub has done what it was asked to do in terms of the provision of the facility.  However, we are now in a situation whereby the housing that was supposed to be provided has not materialised.  <\/p><p> The private rented sector is not accessible to people in homeless services and there are many blocks to those individuals accessing local authority housing, which does not exist anyway.  As pointed out, the flood of people into homeless services has been so dramatic that up to the point when we started the orderly wind-down of the facility we were operating at capacity, such that it was agreed that beds would only be closed as people moved through the system.  In other words, rather than closing the facility on 25 or 26 March to 101 people, we agreed that a bed would be closed only when an occupant has been moved to a longer term placement.  In terms of placement this week, as the central placement service was unable to continue to place people on a one-night only basis, we took in the people on rolling placements, with whom we will work to move them out of the system.  Those 43 people remain in the unit.  From a personal perspective, it is difficult for the Crosscare staff team to be in a building in which beds are empty while there are people sleeping outside in sleeping bags because they cannot access beds.  <\/p><p> In regard to the facility, I understand it is a State-owned building which forms part of the property portfolio of the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and that for the facility to remain operational the agreement of that Department would be required.  That is not what we want.  Although the facility is a converted warehouse, those who have seen it will be know that it is of a high standard.  The people who came to stay at the facility yesterday told us they feel safe there and it is where they want to be.  In comparison with sleeping rough, the facility is of a very high quality.  In regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, that is what needs to happen, but Br&uacute; Aimsir is only the tip of the iceberg.  What we need is increased emergency accommodation while we are resourcing a housing scheme.  Until that happens, we will have to invest in additional emergency accommodation for single people, couples and families.  Otherwise, the number of rough sleepers coming into the system will continue to spiral.  What we need is additional emergency facilities that are adequately resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#CCC00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>As stated earlier, we are all committed to independent living and we want to move away from emergency provision.

In addition, there are close to 70 people in Merchant's Quay caf&eacute; over night and 101 people in the Br&uacute; Aimsir facility.  The effect of the closure of this 101-bed facility will be to double the number of rough-sleepers over night.  I do not believe any of us wish to see that happen.  We have a good service provider and a funder.  All that is required is agreement to the continued operation of this facility until such time as another facility can be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin is happy with that answer.

As an example, there are 70,000 cases throughout the country currently claiming rent supplement, and it has been mentioned that if rent supplement is increased, there will be 70,000 cases of rent being increased.  That is not the case and the legislation was changed last year regarding how often landlords can increase rent.  The period has changed to 24 months, which curtails many people.  There are 20,000 people in Dublin on rent supplement.  The Tenancy Protection Service, TPS, has the ability to get people rent caps above the current rent limits, and 1,914 cases have been taken up through the TPS.  Raising rent caps across the board does not automatically mean everybody will get a rent increase but it would be available should the people need it.  Rent regulation and rent certainty stops rent spiralling out of control, as the rates are continuing to do.  It gives people a security of tenure in order that they can remain in a tenancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#EEE00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fionnughla McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will deal with the length of time in emergency accommodation and the allocations issue.  The latest figures indicate that 1,290 people currently in temporary accommodation have been there for more than six months, which indicates the difficulties in moving people on.  We have found that the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, has been significant in our ability from an affordability perspective to move people on.  However, the availability of suitable housing has been an issue.  As a network we are absolutely committed to getting people out of temporary accommodation as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the allocations issue, there is a recognition that some of the individuals and households that we work with require support to return to the community.  Currently, there is not equitable access to social housing stock within the community.  Depaul works in Northern Ireland as well where there is a common selection scheme by which each individual household on the waiting list is allocated points, with access given from a priority perspective.  It determines the level of support required by these households to return to the community.  When we examine the allocation approach, such selection schemes should be considered.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about Housing First, an internationally recognised model by which individuals with complex needs are supported within their communities.

I am glad that all of us here, without exception, have such knowledge.  The witness is absolutely right in identifying the lack of social housing as the problem.  Some of us strongly objected to the policy changes that came about approximately 16 years ago.  We knew the problem would come home to roost eventually, which is where we are now.  It is no harm to repeat that.  We can talk forever about the subject but we must return to direct build and return responsibility for local authority housing - I never agreed with the words \"social housing\" - to the local authorities.  That is the only way it can be resolved.<\/p> <p>  Points were raised about people with particular difficulties, such as vulnerable families perhaps with special needs, addictions and so forth.  They are better served by a body or bodies that have specific skills in that area.  The local authorities do not have that, and I have always said as much.  There is a huge difference in the two requirements.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, in the middle of the boom there were homeless people in this city and throughout the country.  All of us had to deal with it from time to time.  The system was unable to deal with it then, and that is the problem.  If it was unable to deal with it in the middle of the boom, how could it possibly pretend to deal with it in the aftermath?  A question now arises for ourselves.  When do we get to a situation where we remove the necessity for emergency housing in so far as possible?  There will always be a minimal requirement in that regard but, generally, we must remove it.  What we are doing at present is housing people in emergency housing and that should not be the case.  We must move away from that.  There is also the issue with waiting lists, when a person is on the waiting list and they are on an emergency housing waiting list as well.  Eventually one reaches a situation where to get on the emergency waiting list one must go on another waiting list, which is unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it is one of the legacies of some of the things I have discussed already.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Simon Community for identifying the issue of refitting houses that have been handed back.  That happens all over the country.  Some local authorities are beginning to discontinue the practice whereby the kitchens were ripped out of perfectly good houses, tossed into skips and replaced with what was originally put into that local authority house.  If one were to explain this to somebody outside the group of people here, they would not understand how it happens.  However, it happened all the time.  The purpose of the exercise allegedly was to ensure the local authority would not have to replace a teak or an oak kitchen or whatever the case may be.  The logic of it escapes me, but it is causing a large problem.<\/p> <p>  I wish to venture into an area that was not covered, the shared ownership loans.  The rental equity portion has been a massive burden on the unfortunate people concerned, particularly over the last ten years.  A change took place whereby an increase of 4.7% was placed on the rental part of the equity annually.  It is an absolute disgrace and makes it impossible for those people.  It was a penalty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#FFF00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Can I interrupt the Deputy?

The issue of support for the vulnerable was raised by numerous people and it is something that is growing.  The problem is that growing numbers of people who previous had difficulty getting a local authority house now find themselves homeless and are on a different list altogether.  It comes back to the need to reinvigorate direct build by local authorities and to call them local authority houses.  Alongside that, local authority loans must be reintroduced in order to pick off the people who are now on the local authority housing list but who previously were able to provide themselves with a house.  They are the young people.<\/p><p> The last point I want to make relates to the people who all three groups have referred to.  We find in our work as public representatives that the people we deal with are young people, mostly with families.  It is a sad reflection on our society that we have children whose introduction to life is that they do not know where they are going to live tomorrow, or that they know where they are going to live tomorrow and it is in emergency accommodation.  That is a sad reflection on all of us.  This goes back to before the boom, when it was obvious that these things were going to happen.  The point I want to emphasise is that it is essential, just as in preparation for schools, the demography needs to be taken into account, that we identify the housing need, in terms of the number of families coming onstream, the number of children born in a particular year and the number of people likely to be in need of local authority housing or any other type of housing in the ten to 20 years afterwards.

Mr. Dunne opened by referring to the supply issue.  Certainly what we have today is a crisis of supply, be it in private houses or social housing.  We have a housing strategy in place from the outgoing Government, which is going to deliver some houses in 18 months to two years.  Witnesses have talked about preventative measures as well - that we have to prevent people becoming homelessness - but it is the people who are homeless who we need to provide with housing solutions.  Have any of the three groups ideas about how to fast-track much-needed supply?  We are all agreed on the long-term stuff - that we need to change things.  We can look back and say things were not done properly and we are where we are but what we need from groups like those represented by the witnesses are some ideas in terms of how they can help us fast-track those kind of solutions.<\/p> <p>  One of the first things many of the NGOs say is that we have to increase rent supplement across the board.  I do not share that view.  As a practitioner who holds eight clinics every week, from Balbriggan to Swords, in areas with a housing crisis, the kind of person who comes into my clinic is somebody who is about to be made homeless and is looking for a place to stay.  The problem is that he or she cannot find a place to stay or to rent.  Irrespective of the caps, I know that if he or she finds a place, the community welfare officer has the flexibility to go beyond the caps.  This has been, and is, happening.  That is what I see.  I also see situations where people are in accommodation and the landlord wants to put up the rent and I know the community welfare officer will have the flexibility to meet that increased demand.  Where the need for increased rent supplement exists, it is supplied, so why in the name of God would we increase the rent caps for the other 70,000 people for whom there is no pressure to put them up?  That would not be a great use of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#GGG00300","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I might address one or two of those points before letting others jump in.  The two things that come to mind with regard to fast-track supply are acquisition and rapid building.  I agree that we cannot have a thriving economy without having a functioning housing market.  The state of the overall housing market has all kinds of impacts.  For example, companies like Google are having to pay more to their employees in order that they can rent accommodation in Dublin.  Public or social housing is a subset within the bigger bubble that is overall housing supply.  The homeless factor comes below that, with the private renter in between.  The movement between all of these linked factors is causing all sorts of difficulties.  As a result, we are continuing with emergency accommodation that none of us wants to see in this day and age.  We never wanted to see it.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the approach that should be taken to fast-track supply.  The nature of our planning and building system is that development takes a remarkable amount of time.  Many of our organisations are approved bodies that are involved in the construction and supply of housing units.  Between two and a half and three years can pass from the initial identification of a site to the actual delivery of housing supply.  It is no different for local authorities.  There is an urgent need for supply in the interim while all of that is being moved forward and while policy decisions on local authority housing are being made here and in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  The first of the two routes that appear to be available is acquisition by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This is something that could move relatively quickly.  When rapid-build housing, which is the second available route, was first mooted, many people reflected on whether such an approach was desirable.  They expressed concern about the quality of the housing and whether we were entering into a two-tier system of good quality housing and very shoddy housing.  I am happy to say that as things have moved on in this regard, it seems we are talking about faster built housing rather than poor quality housing.  My understanding is that the current tender that has been issued in the Dublin region is for housing that is guaranteed to last a minimum of 60 years.  The housing supplied in the Poppintree area of Ballymun appears to be of a very high standard.  I know Depaul Ireland is involved in supporting that project.  My own organisation, the Sophia Housing Association, is involved in supporting another scheme that is coming.  I believe the targets we are setting are way below the pressing need that exists.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has highlighted that many millions of euro are being spent on hotel accommodation at the moment.  I suggest that we accelerate acquisition as an interim emergency measure and that we also accelerate both the planning and construction elements of rapid building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#HHH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Would anybody like to address specifically the second question that was asked?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#HHH00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Could I speak briefly about the rapid-build programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#HHH00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We raised the issue of tenure type in our wider submission to the committee.

While I cannot speak for the organisations involved, as long as the individuals who are staying in the service are provided with additional emergency accommodation, it will be good that the plot of land in question will be used to provide housing for people who are experiencing homelessness.<\/p><p>Again, it is a slightly different point.  My point is about the quantity of quality emergency accommodation required.  I would assume that at the beginning of the cold weather initiative there was hope that 101 people would move through the system and that the numbers coming in would not be as significant as they are.  As I mentioned earlier, we have moved almost 200 people through that facility.  If it was set up to move 101 people out, the fact that it has doubled that number is an achievement.  The difficulty is the influx.  On where we are now, as I pointed out earlier, the difficulty is in respect of who has the authority to sign off in terms of the use of the premises.  If it was not to happen again, obviously there is a need for more security in regard to the term of the lease.  Given that it is a State-owned facility, I would have assumed that the two Departments would talk to each other and the issue would be resolved.  It seems unusual that one Department would contribute to the numbers of rough sleepers and that another Department would try to solve the issue.  I do not know if what I have said answers that aspect of the question.<\/p><p> Staffing and social workers were mentioned.  We work with people who have complex mental health and medical issues right across the sector, particularly those who are in services for a longer period.  They are in services for longer because they are becoming the less visible.  The families and those who are newly homeless are able to move out of services quicker while those with more complex needs are stuck in services.  I speak on behalf of those services that I know in Dublin where there are trained workers who work on assessments.  There is a full pathways-to-home model in which all staff are trained in terms of providing holistic needs assessments and an absolute focus on exits to homelessness.  Where we all need additional resources is in terms of mental health workers because the mental health impact on people who are experiencing homelessness is very intense.  Given that they have their homes, there is that whole sense of grief and bereavement around losing their home and isolation and loss of their community.  We see a significant number of people who are in contact with our homeless services taking their own lives.<\/p><p> While I cannot speak for other organisations, Crosscare has seen a significant number of medical discharges directly into homelessness.  While there is a plan to implement a national discharge policy, it has not been rolled out.  It is still on the Dublin Region Homeless Executive's plan for implementation this year but I am aware there have been difficulties in trying to role out that plan.  Sometimes even talking about cases brings the issue home.  We have heard unbelievable stories about people being discharged from hospital.  One of our services in Crosscare had a woman who was discharged who was told she was going to die within a couple of weeks.  She came into our services with no palliative care.  We had no information around how she was going to die and our staff team found her dead.  That is the fourth medical death we have had from a hospital discharge since Christmas.  In terms of that policy from the HSE and the point I made earlier about restoration of funding levels for the executive, specifically focusing on homeless services is absolutely paramount.  While our staff are trained in assessment and working with people out of homes - some services to a greater or lesser extent have medical staff - we do not have medical staff on our teams 24 hours a day.  Given that the people with whom we are working have complex addiction issues and mental health issues, we really require that right across the sector.<\/p><p> I might allow someone else contribute at this point but I may be able to come back in again later in respect of the question on foreign nationals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#JJJ01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Mr. Carroll has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#KKK00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>On the issue of pressure on staff, a number of factors can help staff deal with vulnerabilities.

It would help specifically with chronic mental health issues, physical health issues requiring access to district nursing and fast-tracking into methadone beds in order to stabilise drug use.<\/p> <p>  We are aware the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, has been working its socks off in order to deal with the huge influx of homeless people who have come its way.  The sheer number of people who have become homeless has been overwhelming for everybody.  Now we need to take a step back and take a two to three year planning approach.  We need to look at our projections over the next three years regarding the amount of temporary accommodation available to us and an interdepartmental approach must be taken towards providing the facilities and land for the provision of temporary accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The figures were provided earlier.  Some 102 people are currently rough sleeping and 90 people were turned away last night on the freephone service and there are potentially 100 more to add to that.  Based on what has happened in the past year, we need to be able to predict how many families and single people are likely to come into the system over the next two years, until housing supply can catch up.

Emergency accommodation should be for the shortest possible time.  It is important  in terms of the housing first approach that where possible, we normalise housing offers to people as much as possible.  Some people will require round the clock care, and that should be catered for, but high support emergency accommodation is not a normal place for most people.  Fractious behaviour in such an environment is exacerbated because there are people from 18 to 80 with a range of different complex needs all under the same roof.  Discharge from hospitals to accommodation like this is not appropriate either.  In some cases, there is no choice but people should be moved on as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  We work through the HSE's adult homeless integrated team which supports hostels in terms of psychiatric support through community psychiatric nurses, a consultant psychologist and so forth.  This approach helps enormously in terms of allowing staff to manage some situations regarding people with complex needs.  Part of the approach is training for staff.  We must recognise the nature of the issues people present with and must train our staff to be able to assess risk so as to promote inclusion rather than exclusion.  The better trained one's staff, the better able and more confident they will be in dealing with people with challenging issues.<\/p> <p>  The key to dealing with these people is to move them on as quickly as possible.  However, the difficulty is that those with complex needs tend to be those who are hardest to house.

However, I will begin with the Dublin region.  We have a fortunate arrangement in Dublin whereby the four local authorities collaborate with each other and the HSE through one structure, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, through which funding is scheduled.<\/p><p>Multi-annual plans for all of the homeless needs in the four Dublin authorities go through that and are debated.  There is a consultative forum and other government agencies feed into the development of that plan.  When the plan is developed, the DRHE then seeks specialist agencies to whom various pieces of work can be contracted.  Organisations might seem as if they are all in the same business but, effectively, they are not.  There is a huge range of specialisation, some of which members will be aware.  I will not mention them by name but some are specifically involved in alcohol services, in addiction services and in services which specialise in very complex needs.  Some services are low threshold services, some specialise in young people and some services are purely preventative.  There are services for single people and there are some for families.  Other services are specifically for people leaving care or people leaving the criminal justice system.  Some services are specifically about domestic violence, mental health or physical disability.  Therefore, in the development of that plan, the DRHE would look to see what competencies are there and would look to find a suitable provider in relation to that.<\/p><p> The funder of the services is principally the local authorities and the HSE.  Service level agreements are drawn up between the individual organisation and the funder.  These contracts are very detailed and comprise two parts to meet all statutory requirements, of which there is a very wide range.  There are also specific targets around the provision of services, the outputs and the outcomes for that particular service.  This is reviewed on a quarterly basis with each provider.  There is submission of all the information back to the individual funder with regard to that service provision.<\/p><p> In addition to that, the State is funding the provision of housing in different parts of the country.  That now comes within the Department of Housing and is also linked to the local authority.  Therefore, where there is a need for housing in a particular county, which might come under a funding scheme like the capital assistance, CAS, scheme, applications are submitted to the local authority.  The local authority reviews the applications and considers them against the existing housing list and needs in that area.  It prioritises and marks the applications based on those needs.  Those submissions go to the Department of Housing which then selects which ones to proceed with.  An individual organisation would be approved and would then enter into detailed contracts with the Department of Housing, or it would not be approved.  The Housing Agency is the regulatory authority which controls the work of approved housing bodies.  It has set codes of governance and financial regulation and we are required to report under all of those headings as well as to the Charities Regulatory Authority and its code of governance, etc.  There is a real willingness and an interest in involving ourselves in all of those levels of accountability as well as in respect of our own boards to whom, as employees, we are directly responsible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#LLL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>With regard to comments made by Mr. O'Connell about working with people who are vulnerable, and picking up on points raised by Deputies Ryan and &Oacute; Broin around the different lengths of stay in emergency accommodation, from our perspective in the mid-west region, of the 227 people who were in Limerick and Clare hostels last year, only 11% went on to private rental and local authority housing.  It must be asked where are the rest of those people going.  They staying in hostels much longer because of the chronic need.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the homeless budget and I believe there was a question on how much we think we need.  The European Observatory on Homelessness states that it costs &euro;29,000 per year to keep one person in emergency accommodation.  Deputy Ryan asked what are the solutions.  For us it is about acquisition, as referred to by Mr. Declan Dunne.  We have been in this process in Limerick.  Focus Ireland was awarded the highest allocation of CAS properties in the country last year, with an allocation of 44 units of accommodation.  Hallelujah.  We were delighted.  It turned out to be 17 houses because each unit is considered a bedroom, so it was not hallelujah anymore.  We still have not delivered on those CAS properties because of bureaucracy.  It has taken 12 months, in a serious housing crisis, to deliver on that.  As a specific solution, we have come up with the social rental model as an option.<\/p><p>As I said, it costs &euro;29,000 per year to keep one person in emergency accommodation.  For &euro;20,000, we have moved ten families out of such accommodation.  This started in Cork as a pilot project between the different voluntary organisations and it moved to Limerick.  We were lucky to be funded by the local authority, which saw merit in a pilot we proposed.  Basically, we go in as the tenant.  We rent from the landlord directly and then we sublet.  It is not rocket science.  We are able to manage the different needs the family would present with, because there is a worker dedicated to that household.  As Ms Fiona Barry stated, the chronic issues people present with need to be managed, but they can be managed from their homes.  We now have an extension of the funding and are looking at housing 18 families between Limerick and Clare over the next 12 months, which is fantastic.<\/p><p> There is a difference between rural and urban issues.  There is a recognition that there is a homelessness crisis outside of Dublin as well, which is something we feel very strongly about.  I am sure Mr. Aaron O'Connell will agree with me on that.  When we, as in our alliances, meet we talk about that a lot.  Our numbers are not the same - they are not as high - but there is still a significant number of people in emergency accommodation.  These are families and children whom it is affecting.  On that point, there are different needs throughout the country when it comes to urban and rural.  What one finds in the rural areas is that people need to come into the urban towns.  People need to come in from parts of County Clare such as Kilrush or Kilkee into Ennis.  Ennis only has a 12-bed hostel.  It has nothing else to provide them with.  <\/p><p> The other aspect following on from that is domestic violence, which is a huge issue when it comes to what we discuss in the Limerick and Clare Homeless Alliance.  In Limerick and Clare last year, in 2015, 297 families were turned away from the refuges in the region - ADAPT House and Clare Haven Services - because there is a lack of beds.  Domestic violence is a huge issue affecting families in rural areas, yet it is not counted in the statistics as homelessness.  That is because of the different funding streams.  Domestic violence services are funded by Tusla and, therefore, are not counted in our statistics when we are presenting on homeless families.  This is something we wanted to highlight as it is definitely an issue we face in rural areas.  <\/p><p> I will make a final point on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I do not know the situation in Cork but we are finding that landlords are not signing up to the HAP scheme.  There is too much bureaucracy.  There is added bureaucracy with the HAP that was not there before.  Yes, it is a solution but it is something that is not being taken up by landlords because of all the different forms, etc., they have to hand in.  That is something we are concerned about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#MMM00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tr&iacute;ona O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Before I go back, Ms Barry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#NNN00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>There were two other questions I felt I was able to come back to Deputy O'Sullivan on.  One related to the number of families out of homelessness.  Unfortunately, I did not bring that with me.  However, I can tell her the number of singles, which was 413 in the first quarter of this year in Dublin.  The Dublin Region Homelessness Executive compiles a great set of statistics on its website illustrating the trends in and out of homeless services and the tenancies created.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to the issue raised about foreign nationals.  For me there are a number of issues although I am not an expert on this area.  I have colleagues in Crosscare who are much more familiar with this issue but there are a number of aspects to it.  First, I wish to highlight the issue of those in direct provision who have achieved refugee status, that is, those who now have status to live in the country.  In some ways, we have not counted those individuals, who will require housing, in the numbers for the housing build and allocations going forward.  Those individuals are also given a timeframe to access the private rented sector.  However, some of those individuals also start accessing homeless services.  They have their status and they are entitled to be here.  I am not an expert on it, but it is a significant issue in terms of those in direct provision.  <\/p> <p>  Foreign nationals were mentioned.  I know I drive my colleagues on the Dublin network demented when I keep coming back to the \"ineligible\" issue, although I think Mr. David Carroll agrees with me on this one.  There is a difference between those who we call eligible for placement - those six-month placements where one can do a full assessment and assess people to exit homelessness - and others.  However, the issue of people being eligible for those placements is much broader than whether one is a foreign national.<\/p><p>Therefore, if a person is from Cork and she comes to Dublin, she is not eligible for a long-term placement.  Instead, she stays in a one night only system.  If we cannot get hold of a person because she is going through that one night only system, she does not then get assessed.  She is in the emergency system or potentially sleeping rough but she is not eligible for longer-term placement.  That category also includes returning Irish and internal migrants as well as many migrants who potentially cannot establish the fact that they have lived in Dublin.  Such people may have sublet or may have been in house-sharing arrangements.  They may have worked here for a substantial length, even for many years during the boom, but it may have been work on the black market for cash in hand and therefore they cannot establish their history.  Some also have significant language difficulties when it comes to being able to access services.<\/p><p> We have people who are out of status.  We have a significant document which I would be more than happy to send through to the committee.  It covers all the categories of status and those we deem ineligible for placement.  The issues in respect of all the categories are rather different in terms of their pathway out of homelessness.  We also have the new communities unit.  Again, I am not an expert in answering queries on that work.  Perhaps Mr. Carroll might be able to answer more thoroughly but my understanding is that some of those individuals are counted on PASS while some are not.  Therefore, we have a cohort of people who are also placed by the new communities unit in private emergency accommodation with no supports on site.  That is another category.  All the people in that category are probably rather hidden in terms of the extent of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#NNN00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the issue of hotels.

Focus Ireland and other organisations do likewise.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive is providing funding for a case-managed approach for those families.  Our experience is that for the majority of people it is a supply issue.  Some of those involved have complex and vulnerable needs but most of them have housing needs.  In this interim situation, rapid-build housing is key to enable us to create enough temporary accommodation to provide an alternative to hotels.  However, while people are in the hotel situation, the type of support they get is critical to ensure the children go to school in their locality, that they are feeding in to community interventions and that children are receiving proper nutritious meals rather than takeaway meals.  Such interventions for this existing cohort are critical as part of a co-ordinated strategic approach being taken by the DRHE at the moment in partnership with other community interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#OOO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Since it is getting late in the afternoon, I am going to take contributions from the remaining members.

Having listened to Ms O'Connor, it is clearly very complex.  I note Mr. O'Connell said we need to simplify things.  I will not ask Mr. O'Connell to go through it now but I would appreciate if he came back on his own in a week or so with some suggestions on how we can simplify the housing assistance payment or any other system we use.  Sometimes we create processes and box-ticking exercises but we do not actually get things done.  I take on board what he has said and I agree wholeheartedly that we need to get the emergency sorted out.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Connell suggested that we need to increase the number of rapid-build options.  I believe such options should be for permanent housing as opposed to temporary housing, and we need to increase the number of acquisitions as well.

I agree with the point made in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the closing of some of the emergency situations.<\/p><p>We would perhaps need a rapid increase in the number of bed units or whatever for the homeless.

These are some of the best submissions we have got from any housing organisations because they deal with real recommendations and there is nothing in them that cannot be implemented.  It goes back to the will to do it and that is a job for this committee.<\/p> <p>  The issue of women at risk of domestic violence is very important.  In Kilkenny there are three homeless facilities, one of which is a hotel.  They are always full and have waiting lists.  It is not as bad as in Dublin and other big cities but many women present after domestic violence.  They will not take up places that are offered in Clonmel or Waterford because they would have to go out of the school region or the family setting.  They fall into nowhere land.  It takes a lot to leave a situation where there is domestic violence.  This is the first time these problems have been raised at this committee, like that of people under 26.

That is a huge challenge and, from what the witnesses have said, it is not being met in any respect.  It is probably more an issue for the Government than for this committee.  One answer might be to incentivise landlords through tax.  In other words, some part of their mortgage debt or whatever could be written off provided they gave a tenancy for five years to the local authority.  The tax advantage could be tied into the length of the lease or the term of the occupation.  We have an awful lot of work to do on that.

Would it make sense for people outside local authorities to act as advocates for applicants?  All of the issues an applicant might need to present to the local authority could, if the applicant chose to do so, go through the advocate.  There would be a professional, full-time, staffed office separate from the local authority.  It would deal not with the physical housing need, but with all of the other issues, whether they be medical, social or family-related.<\/p> <p>  One of the categories that has cost me the most thought is that of men who are separated, in their 40s or 50s, who may have significant alcohol or personality problems.  They are thrown on the scrap heap of life.  While many of them will find a bed when they are not drinking, when they are drinking they are on the street.  We need to look at that.  Part of the problem is that they are on the housing list longer than anybody else.  Because they may have no children or just one child, they are down the list of priority and are told \"Sorry, we do not have a two bedroom house\".  There is a whole load of issues there.  Perhaps when they go back, in their wisdom, the witnesses could help us formulate a new way of treating people.  What is fundamental is the humanity, the human being, in all of our works, whatever they are.  The goodness of those men - everything that they are - is lost at the moment, because nobody has time to listen or the skills to articulate the problem.<\/p><p>There is nowhere they can go to sort out all their other issues, which are huge, and housing is only part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#QQQ00500","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Members asked a range of questions and I will give each witness an opportunity to respond to those that are relevant to their areas.

Mr. Dunne and I were talking outside the room and we agreed we can get lost in the politics and bureaucracy in terms of the issues but we are talking about people's lives.  I have been working in homeless services since 2000 and in terms of all the people I have met in that time, all they want is a home.  They want a place they can call their own and it is our job to get them that.  That is why we are here.  All the staff I work with work tirelessly for that to happen.  Some cases take longer than others.  Some people have many more issues than others, but that is the crux of it.  When I made my submission earlier I think I rushed through a number of points to have them said, but I appreciate being here in my role and the fact that I have been given an opportunity to speak on behalf of the clients with whom I work.  That is what we must remember.  That is why we are all here, and that is why the members are here.<\/p> <p>  It was said earlier that we need to simplify the process.  The solutions are available; we just need to work to make them happen sooner rather than later.  As an alliance, what came up when we met to discuss this meeting was that we can get caught up in bureaucracy in terms of an issue and it takes much longer than necessary for solutions to be found.  There are solutions.  All of us have put forward solutions that can happen rapidly.  There are longer-term issues that must be dealt with, and they will be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to present to the committee and appreciate the time the members have given us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#RRR00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tr&iacute;ona O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>On the point about the voids and the offers made, we said at the social housing forum that there should be more research done into the reasons people are refusing housing.  The expectations might be too high in some cases but in many cases it depends on the location.  The difficulty for some people is that they need to be close to their support networks for them to be able to manage, particularly in terms of the crisis we have endured over many years.  The one thing that has kept some families together was their support networks.  Those who did not have those support networks fell into homelessness, were on the verge of homelessness or dealing with very stressful circumstances.  There is not one answer to those questions but we need to focus on the whys and the wherefores.  More research needs to be done on that but networks are important.<\/p> <p>  People's income is important as well because someone either has transport or they do not.  Some of the issues raised were about people on low incomes who were unable to take up the options NAMA provided gave across the country, which were outside transport networks.  That is a determinant as to whether somebody will take up an offer.<\/p> <p>  In terms of those under the age of 26, we are treating them as if they were less equal than others, and that is wrong.  There must be equality in terms of the offers made and people should not be treated differently because they are young.  That is exclusionary and it must be dealt with.  Those young people have no chance of moving out, even if options were available, because they do not have the money to do it.  They are being discriminated against at that level, and a major question arises in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the choice-based lettings, in some of the more recent cases in Cork there were no offers under choice-based lettings because there was nothing to offer.  There are issues around that, and that is part of the problem.  It is a question of whether there is a choice and what are those choices.  The reality, whether to do with local authority housing or otherwise, is that there are no choices because there is nothing available.  That is the problem.<\/p> <p>  We acquired land by way of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for roads and so on in the past.  Circumstances are challenging for everybody.<\/p><p>We need to get off the fence in terms of what it is.  There is a challenge around people's rights of possession of housing and so forth.  They are things that can be overcome for the greater common need.  I believe we need to look at it in those circumstances.  Where something is not being used, it should be brought into play wherever it can be.  Not everything will be suitable.  The areas that people are in or the areas available may not be suitable for a particular category, such as in the case of transport.  Those things are really important: bus routes, local community facilities, pharmacies, GPs, health centres and so forth.<\/p><p> When talking about families and the new builds - whether they are rapid or otherwise - we must be very clear.  Families need to be able to get their children to school.  We must not ghettoise people.  We must stabilise people's situations.  Wherever we can, we should not disrupt people in terms of movement because that has a particularly negative impact on children.  Where possible, we must normalise what we can do and keep people as close as possible to their existing networks.<\/p><p> The problem of empty units is a difficult one.  There is a clash around the issue of people's rights, but we have to overcome those obstacles.  In terms of using a CPO, if somebody is not using a unit, in many respects it is a case of having the right offer.  There are challenges around being able to do it, but it is a mechanism that is there and we should look at it.<\/p><p> The Part VIII will speed up the process so that one does not have to go through everything.  It is not something we would normally advocate because, as a community organisation and people who work in the community, it is important that we bring the community with us.  However, we are in very challenging times now.  Everybody must become part of the solution.  The task of communities around the country is to accept people into their communities and to become part of the solution as opposed to putting more obstacles in the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#RRR00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1463045400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I would love to be sitting here thinking we did not need emergency accommodation.  Previous speakers have done a great job of bringing it back to the people we serve and provide services for.  I would like to thank the committee for their support of Br&uacute; Aimsir and of emergency accommodation on behalf of the residents of that service, those who are sleeping rough tonight and the 58 people who could have been in those beds last night and tonight.  I really appreciate the support on their behalf.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure it is Dublin City Council that the committee needs to pursue to intervene at this stage.  My understanding is that it is probably a conversation that needs to happen between the two Ministers at this point.  I particularly appreciate Deputy Catherine Byrne's support, given that we are in her constituency.  I am delighted that she has not been ringing me for any other reasons because the support and feedback we have received from her local community have been second to none.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the links with Merchant's Quay and the medical facilities there.  The experience is that people tend to move around services, but it is a particular niche group that attends Merchant's Quay.  Obviously, many people do not have addiction issues and do not want to access services there.  We have also seen a massive increase in people accessing our services in wheelchairs.  That provides a real difficulty in terms of access to services.<\/p> <p>  We need to provide medical services on site.  Sometimes people cannot leave their room or leave the facility to access medical services due to their mental health.  We have great support from Safetynet for Br&uacute; Aimsir and our other emergency facilities through the provision of medical facilities on site.  Unfortunately, what it can provide is very limited.  As a matter of priority, I ask that the HSE hospital discharge policy be implemented as soon as possible, because we need to stop people from being discharged into homeless services.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of vacant properties.  From a personal perspective, last year I had the unfortunate task of applying for the fair deal scheme on behalf of my mother, who has since passed away.<\/p><p>There is an absolute disincentive within the fair deal scheme to rent out a property.  If my mother was in a nursing home the property would have been vacant to this day.  We need to look at the question of a disincentive under the fair deal scheme to rent out vacant properties when people are in nursing homes.  A lot of properties in this category are probably vacant.<\/p><p> A group of residents, known to our services, made their own submission to the committee yesterday.

For landlords the paperwork is a deterrent to HAP but the idea of an NCT for houses should be kept because if accommodation is too easy to get it is usually not of a great standard and nobody should be living in such a property.<\/p> <p>  Tax incentives for landlords were proposed.  When I started working in the access housing unit within the service I used to find accommodation for people living in homeless services and landlords used to ring to offer accommodation because they wanted to give something back and to do something good.  That is no longer the case.  They have had such a hard time with the administrative aspects of rent supplement over the years, and with rent being stopped because of tenants not returning paperwork, that they have turned their back on rent supplement.  In a lot of cases they look at HAP along the same lines, the only positive thing being that they get HAP paid to them in full every month, something for which we have been fighting for years.  The incentives have to be there to attract landlords back into the market.  <\/p> <p>  The five-year leasing scheme, with local authority tax incentives, would be very welcome, as would powers for the local authority to advocate on people's behalf.

This committee is focused on two things - housing and homelessness.  For housing, there are three words: \"supply\", \"supply\", \"supply\".<\/p><p> In terms of homelessness, I put it to the committee that it is a symptom of something else.  From my work experience in Sophia, more than half of the people we support come with a history of the care system, and I believe the experience has been similar for the other representatives.  What does that mean?  If people have come through that situation, they have not benefited from having parents available to support them, both in terms of care and the boundaries that they need.  I am a parent of two adult boys and we loved and cared for them, but we also created some boundaries because they needed those to be able to operate successfully in life.<\/p><p> Many of those in these services that the State is paying for are providing homes for people but they are also providing support for people to engage effectively with society.  It is not their fault that the people did not benefit in that way when they were young.  The professional staff we have, most of whom have level 8 qualifications and master's degrees and are working for very little money on fixed pay, are working to teach people those skills to be able to be constructive participants in society.  I strongly believe that the effectiveness and efficiency of this investment is bringing back more than the provision of housing to people in this situation.  It is helping with respect to all those other costs in the criminal justice system and in all the other systems that exist in the country.  I thank the committee for continuing to do that.  It is very worthwhile and it is appropriate in this, the centenary year of 1916, that focus and attention is being given to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016051200002#TTT00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1463045400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunne.
