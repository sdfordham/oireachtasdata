He is accompanied today by Mr. John Riordan.  No apologies have been received.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of our meetings on 22 and 24 November and on 1 and 8 December last.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  In terms of matters arising from the minutes, we will take it that any relevant matters arising will be dealt with in the normal course of our work.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  We have a considerable amount of correspondence to deal with because it has been some time since we had a public meeting.  The first item of correspondence is the opening statement from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA, which we have noted and published.  We will be dealing with that later.<\/p> <p>  The next item is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  These are follow-up items relating to previous meetings.  The first item is No. 201B, an e-mail from Brown Rudnick expressing surprise and disappointment regarding the publishing of details of a letter sent to the committee prior to its consideration by the committee.  We did receive a letter and I saw references to extracts from it in the newspapers before it was considered by this committee.  It is extremely disappointing that some members chose to go down that route.  We note the points made by Brown Rudnick, which are fair comment.  We will note it and publish that remark.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from Professor Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank, regarding State organisations lodging money with the Central Bank.  We will note and publish that letter.  The next item is correspondence from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing information requested at our meeting on 20 October.  We will note and publish that.  The next item of correspondence is No. 217B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee on the transfer of property under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  We will note and publish that.  There is other correspondence relating to that general indemnity agreement which I will refer to later.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 219 B (i) and (ii), correspondence from the OPW regarding rents paid by that office and the Department of Social Protection.  We will note and publish that.  The next item is No. 220B, correspondence from the Minister for Finance providing a response to a request for information from the committee in relation to NAMA and Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that and will also include it on the Project Eagle section of our site, which is an internal method of recording all Project Eagle related correspondence for committee members.  The next item is No. 221B from Ms Michelle Lowe of NAMA providing a response to a request for information from the committee relating to Project Eagle.  We will note and publish that too.<\/p> <p>  I will now move on to Category C correspondence which is correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.<\/p><p>Nos. 181C, (i) to (iii), is correspondence from the North Meath Communities Development Association in regard to an ongoing issue with the HSE.  This matter was dealt with in some detail by the previous Committee of Public Accounts, which also wrote to the HSE at that time.  However, there was a recognition that this is a matter of a disputed contract and ultimately a matter for the HSE.  I would like to defer consideration of this matter to our next meeting to allow members time to study the documentation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016121400002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481709600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Prior to the summer recess I raised the issue of correspondence issued by the previous committee in January of this year citing that this matter had also been referred to the Taoiseach's Department.

Since then we have come across a number of other organisations where similar problems have arisen.  There appears to be a problem in terms of accountability and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  Is there merit in the Comptroller and Auditor General doing a special report on section 38 and 39 organisations' processes?  It would appear that this is not an isolated issue.

Every year there is a report on it that the committee is free to examine as it wishes.  It is at a process level though, rather than at the level of individual entities.

In the course of the committee's examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle, the committee had sought a considerable amount of information from NAMA.  We are very grateful to NAMA for the material supplied to the committee to date.  One particular item requested was a copy of the contemporaneous notes in the format taken during the meeting that were used in the subsequent preparation of the minutes of NAMA board meetings held on 12 December 2013 and 8 January 2014.  NAMA responded to the committee that once NAMA board minutes are adopted by the board members, they are the official record of that particular meeting.  As a result, the board secretary&rsquo;s contemporaneous notes of the meeting are transitory records and are not retained.  As I mentioned at our last private meeting, I was surprised by this considering the importance of the meetings and the fact that the board was considering the sale of assets worth &pound;1.3 billion.  For that reason, we have asked for NAMA to put on the record at this meeting its policy regarding the retention of contemporaneous notes in respect of the preparation of board minutes.  I will allow for some short questions at the end but I ask that members do not drift into other topics today and that they be very brief.  This session will be over within one hour at the very latest.  It may not go that far but I will be closing the meeting at 11.45 a.m. if it is not concluded by then.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.

It is the fifth occasion on which the chief executive and I have appeared before the committee to deal with this issue.  We estimate that NAMA representatives have already responded to about 2,000 oral questions during our appearances and to about 100 written questions, which have been submitted to us by the committee.  We received yesterday some additional questions to which we will respond very shortly.  We trust that this extensive evidence, in both oral and written form and which has been provided to the committee by NAMA, will be of much assistance to it in the preparation of its report. <\/p> <p>  The committee has invited us today to discuss a specific issue and it has indicated to us that the morning session will be confined to a maximum of one hour.  The specific issue relates to the contemporaneous notes taken during board meetings in late 2013 and early 2014.  These notes were used to prepare the minutes of the meetings.  According to a press release issued by the committee after its meeting on Thursday of last week, it appears surprise was expressed that the written notes used to prepare the board minutes were not retained by NAMA.  The committee will be aware that the signed board minutes are the official record of each meeting.  I propose to help the committee to explain the position on the preparation of board minutes, which would typically record the following: board members in attendance and apologies in the case of absences, the date and time of the meeting, disclosure of interests, each agenda item considered by the board, the decision or decisions in respect of each agenda item, whether a decision was required, with concise coverage of the substance of the deliberations on that agenda item, any action item arising from a decision and any concern or objection which a board member wishes to record. <\/p> <p>  The secretary attends the board meeting and takes written notes.  From these notes, draft typed minutes are prepared which record the decisions and the actions decided at the meeting.  As soon as practicable following the meeting, typically two to three working days, the draft minutes are sent to me, as chairman, for review.<\/p><p>Following the chairman's review, the draft minutes are circulated to the board members for comment, typically within five working days of the meeting.  Board members are expected to revert to the secretary with any comments they may have within three working days of receipt of the draft minutes.  The final agreed minutes, as reviewed by all board members, are then presented and approved by the board at a subsequent board meeting and they are then signed by the chairman.  The minutes approved by the board and signed by the chairman are regarded in law as evidence of the proceedings and of the decisions taken by the board.  There can be only one set of official minutes of meetings.  The secretary then disposes of the written notes taken during the meeting as they are no longer required.  The secretary's notes serve no purpose other than to assist the secretary in preparing the typed draft minutes for circulation to the chairman and board members.  Once the minutes are agreed and approved, there is no reason the secretary's handwritten notes should be retained.<\/p><p> This is the practice which NAMA operates and which I understand applies throughout the public service and elsewhere in line with best practice in corporate governance.  For instance, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, ICSA, has produced a guidance note on minute taking, and I refer to the 2016 version, which recommends the following procedure for written notes:  \"On balance we recommend that the notes should be retained until the minutes are approved but then promptly destroyed.\"<\/p><p> In conclusion, NAMA's procedures in relation to board minutes are therefore very much in line with recommended best practice.  Once a set of minutes has been agreed and approved by the board in relation to a particular meeting then that becomes the record of the proceedings and of the decisions taken at that meeting.  Accordingly, I cannot see what merit there would be in retaining written notes after they have fulfilled their basic purpose of assisting the board's secretary to type up the draft minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016121400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481709600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the chairman.

We are entitled to proceed on that basis.  On the two meetings we asked about, there are two references.  It is on page 111 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It refers to a NAMA board meeting of 8 January 2014.

What obligations does this place on it to retain records?  To put it simply, Deputies would be alarmed if, when dealing with a Department, for example, the Department of Health or the Department of Social Protection, they were told that the notes on how the Department arrived at a decision in a case were not retained or if the chief appeals officer in the Department of Social Protection stated that notes were not kept on how a decision was arrived at.  One would expect public bodies to be able to demonstrate how they arrived at a decision, even though the final decision is the final legal decision.  Does Mr. Daly understand that we, in our daily work, can often get behind the final decision because when we challenge how a decision was arrived at, the Department is able to produce the record?
