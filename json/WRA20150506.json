In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. <\/p>  <p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. <\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Retirement Savings Group","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[12947\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will publish the minutes of meetings held between her Department and the Department of Finance pertaining to the universal retirement savings development group; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>In line with the Statement of Government Priorities, the Government recently decided to proceed with work to develop a roadmap for the introduction of a new, universal, supplementary workplace retirement saving scheme.

While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.<\/p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and\/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected. Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before.  The proposed option could provide a structure to ensure that advice and input in relation to local issues continues and for networking to maintain local connections.  <\/p>  <p>  The Design Group's recently proposed option will require further development, to include estimates of costs that may arise and potential savings that may accrue from moving to a reduced company and Board structure, together with a risk assessment.  At this early stage, indicative high level savings arising from a reduced governance structure, from 93 companies and Boards to 12, suggest there may be savings achievable in the amount of &euro;340,000 per annum.  It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA08300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Administration","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA08400"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[17344\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600050#WRA08500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the delays in processing applications for rent allowance, in particular for residents of Dublin South Central; and the reason that requests for additional information from her Department automatically result in an application being put to the bottom of the processing pile.","asker":"1193","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>The rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<\/p>  <p>   To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must -<\/p>  <p>- have at least 520 paid contributions, and<\/p>  <p>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person's contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker's scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as it was previously estimated that this could cost up to approximately &euro;160 million annually.  In any event, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[17336\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of stark evidence from the European Union's Survey on Income and Living Conditions 2013, which showed that consistent poverty rates for one-parent family households increased by 32%, from 17.7% to 23%, while there was no statistically significant increase in the general population, if she will suspend any further reform, until a proper impact assessment is undertaken; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>While Government policies are restoring economic growth, this recovery is not yet reflected in the 2013 SILC data on household living standards.

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of  right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  Similarly, there will be many contributors who would not require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit at half-rate at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  <\/p>  <p>  The social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government's commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.<\/p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, that is, one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published in 2012 found that Fund has a strong redistributive nature.  This is demonstrated by the fact that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes and the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[17282\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600051#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to allow for the full payment of carer's allowance, along with the full widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pensions in cases where a spouse dies while their partner is already in receipt of a carer's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>Currently, where a person in receipt of widow(er)'s pension is providing full-time care and attention to a care recipient, s\/he can also receive a half-rate carer's allowance.

The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.

In recognition of the benefits that the scheme provides and despite severe pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million. It should be noted that the provision for the scheme was also increased by &euro;2 million as part of Budget 2013 which was used to extend the scheme to some 100 additional DEIS and special schools benefitting over 9,800 additional children. <\/p>  <p>  Facilities required for the provision of a breakfast club are primarily determined by the type of service provided by an individual school.

There are approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 3,600 are in Kildare, for which the Government has provided a total of over &euro;298 million for in 2015. Statistics in relation to persons in receipt of rent supplement in lieu of local authority housing are not available.<\/p>  <p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is generally made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. The information requested in relation to arrears is not available.  It is open to any landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement may be suspended and the matter investigated. <\/p>  <p>  Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision on their rent supplement claim, including the decision regarding an overpayment, may appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The appeal must be in writing and within 21 days of the date they were notified of the decision on their claim. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for a disclosure of a change of means rests with the social welfare recipient. Notwithstanding this, there is ongoing dialogue between staff in the community welfare service and the housing authorities to ensure that a person's accommodation needs are appropriately addressed and, where necessary, the provision of relevant information. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system which will provide for a number of positive improvements. New applicants with long term housing needs will be considered under HAP in these local authority areas rather than rent supplement. As part of the implementation of HAP, the Department is working closely with the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), on behalf of the local authorities, to agree data sharing protocols and to develop a new technical platform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600052#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Operation","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600052#WRC03625"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[17441\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600052#WRC03650","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will report on the flexibility to be allowed for community employment schemes for community employment workers to remain in employment for at least three years where they are successfully addressing addiction issues and preparing to move on to further education and training; if she will confirm that community employment schemes for those with addiction will have greater flexibility regarding the length of their placement, as was the custom and practice under earlier Ministers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>There has been no change in the entry requirements and operating procedures for CE Drug Rehabilitation schemes.

pensions is increasing because of demographic pressures, this is being managed within the overall welfare budget.  This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions, i.e., 34.4% of all welfare expenditure, and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. <\/p>  <p>  Core pension rates were not reduced in the period since then, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending, and a period of significant deflation which has protected those increases in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty, and all CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65. <\/p>  <p>  The recovery has also allowed some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas bonus last month, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Consequently, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  The State assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600053#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment Data","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600053#WRD04450"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[17842\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600053#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for exceptional needs payments received by her Department, in each of the past twelve months, to date; the number approved; the number refused, those pending; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a wide range of employment services, along with programmes of training and education, work experience, and recruitments supports that address the particular labour market issues facing young people. These are set out in detail in Ireland's implementation plan for the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, and involve other Departments &ndash; most notably the Department of Education and Skills &ndash; as well as the Department of Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  In support of the recommendation for a Youth Guarantee, the EU council agreed that a total of &euro;6bn would be earmarked within EU funds to support approved Youth Employment Initiative projects over the course of the seven year Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. This &euro;6bn comprises &euro;3bn from within the existing European Social Fund (ESF) and an additional &euro;3bn in the form of Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) funding. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Institutions have now agreed that YEI funding should be reserved for use in those regions where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012 (since extended to include regions where youth unemployment was over 20% in 2012 in Member States where youth unemployment had risen by more than 30% over the previous year). Both regions within Ireland satisfy the original 25% threshold. Ireland's allocation is &euro;68.14 million.<\/p>  <p>  The YEI fund is to be allocated to approved projects on a proportional basis. Expenditure on ESF actions will have to be matched by national funds, in accordance with normal structural funds rules. Member States can then access a share of the additional &euro;3 billion. Where ESF-supported projects are eligible for YEI as well, the YEI funding will be equal to and additional to the ESF support.<\/p>  <p>In 2014 alone, the costs for implementing the programmes for the young unemployed in Ireland's Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan were &euro;336 million, or &euro;528 million if the costs of PLC courses and the apprenticeship system are included. Similar costs are likely be incurred, on an annual basis. These costs, in the first instance, are borne by the Irish Exchequer.  It is anticipated that a sufficient share of this expenditure will meet the relevant  eligibility criteria, to allow a full draw-down of Ireland's YEI allocation and the related ESF funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600054#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":335,"content":"<p>Question No. 120 answered with Question No. 80.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600054#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":337,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[17856\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600054#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if it is the policy of her Department to withhold social welfare payments, such as JobSeeker's Allowance, to non-Irish born residents until they have completed English language courses; if it is the policy of her Department to make attending English language courses a condition of receiving a JobSeeker's Allowance; and if so, the legislative and \/ or policy basis for such decisions.","asker":"1008","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":338,"content":"<p>Jobseeker's Allowance is payable to persons who are aged over 18 and under 66 years of age and who are: <\/p><p>-Unemployed;<\/p><p>-Capable of work;<\/p><p>-Available and genuinely seeking work;<\/p><p>-Satisfy a means test; and <\/p><p>-Meet the Habitual Residence Condition <\/p><p>It is not conditional for a person to have English language proficiency in order to receive Jobseekers Allowance.

I, as Minister for Finance,\u00a0have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.\u00a0However, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  I meet regularly with\u00a0the Governor of the Central Bank. The latest of these meetings took place on 2 April where we discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates. We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of this meeting the Governor of the Central Bank is currently reviewing the cost of mortgages to banks. The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the next 10 days or so. I will then\u00a0meet the six principal mortgage lenders\u00a0in order to\u00a0 discuss this issue. <\/p>  <p>  I think that we need to bear in mind that the Financial Institutions Levy announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which allows for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery. The levy will be in place for three years with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million. The imposition of the levy is a proportionate measure on a domestic banking sector.\u00a0The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and it is appropriate that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there have been moves on interest rates. As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. These included a cut of 0.25% for AIB Standard Variable Rate (SVR) customers and 0.38% for EBS and Haven SVR customers. The Bank also announced reductions in Loan to Value (LTV) and Fixed Rate mortgages across AIB, EBS and Haven. These rate reductions will apply to both new and existing customers. <\/p>  <p>  This is the second time in the past six months that AIB Group has reduced its mortgage rates for new and existing customers. The latest move significantly benefits approx. 158,000 mortgage account holders.\u00a0Individual SVR Customers will be advised of the changes in writing by AIB group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600055#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600055#WRF03350"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[17592\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050600055#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of the fact that the &euro;5 billion originally ring-fenced in the &euro;315 billion Juncker investment plan for energy efficiency projects is not going ahead, his plans to secure or ring-fence similar funding for the same purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>Ireland's national approach on Energy efficiency policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. <\/p>  <p>  The EFSI regulation is still under negotiation with Trilogues ongoing with the European Parliament at present.

The primary focus of this strategy is to support those homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, in so far as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence.

This date was\u00a0again\u00a0extended to 9 January 2015 in light of the high volume of payments being received at that time.  Revenue has confirmed to me that the payment compliance rate in respect of 2015 exceeded 75%\u00a0by 9 January, which is an outstanding achievement\u00a0for\u00a0a relatively new tax.  As of April 2015, the LPT 2015 compliance rate is estimated to be 94%. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2015 campaign Revenue wrote to all property owners in October 2014 who either paid their 2014 LPT liability in a single transaction or by way of regular cash payments through one of the approved Payment Service Providers advising them of their 2015 LPT liability.  Revenue did not write to property owners who availed of the various phased payment options in 2014 such as Direct Debit and Deduction at Source from salary or pension because these methods automatically carried on into 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The letters confirmed that any property owners choosing to meet their 2015 liabilities in a single payment were obliged to do so no later than 7 January 2015.  7 January was also confirmed as the latest date to inform Revenue of the intention to opt for the Single Debit Authority payment method even though it would not be debited until 21 March 2015 unless an earlier date was specified by the property owner.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to property owners who paid their 2014 LPT in full by a single transaction but wished to change to a phased payment option for 2015 (Direct Debit or Deduction at Source) the letter requested that they inform Revenue of their preferred choice no later than 25 November 2014.  This lead in period was necessary to allow Revenue time to put the various debit arrangements in place before the start of the calendar year.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2015 warning notice letters issued to the minority of property owners who did not meet their LPT obligations by the extended due date.  I am aware that these notices were clearly worded so that there could be no doubt as to the possible consequences of continued non-compliance.  However the letters were balanced in that they also allowed a further 14 day grace period before any debt collection\/enforcement action was started so that property owners who might have inadvertently forgotten to pay the outstanding liabilities by the due date were afforded ample time to get their affairs up to date.  This was a proper approach for Revenue to adopt in fairness to the vast majority of people who met their LPT obligations on time and is one that I fully endorse. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to Revenue's customer service provision for LPT, the online system is the simplest and most efficient way to access records and submit returns or payments as required.  The system is available 24 hours a day and can be accessed using the secure PIN and Property ID codes that are provided to property owners.  The system can also be used at any time to check balances due, change payment methods or submit queries to Revenue by secure email.  I am assured that where the online system is used to its maximum potential there should be very little requirement for property owners to make any direct personal contact with Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Where direct contact with Revenue is required, the LPT Helpline should be the first point of contact.
