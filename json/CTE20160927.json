I am joined by Mr. McGovern, chairman of CMP, Mr. Codd of Codd Mushrooms in Tullow, County Carlow, Mr. Wilson of Monaghan Mushrooms and Ms Dwyer, the IFA's chief economist.  Along with my role as horticulture chairman, I am the vice chairman of CMP.  Mr. McGovern, Mr. Wilson and I provide mushrooms through CMP, which is a recognised producer group under the EU fruit and vegetables scheme.<\/p><p>Codd Mushrooms is one of the biggest suppliers to the domestic trade, supplying all the main retail outlets in the country.  We are here today under the leadership of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, which has vouched its full support for the horticultural sector to help us get through a crisis where 3,500 jobs are in danger.  There are already 130 jobs gone and &euro;7 million of exports have been lost.<\/p><p> I will give a brief background to the Commercial Mushroom Producers, CMP.  It was established in 1999, following rapid expansion of the industry over the 1990s, which grew to almost 600 mushroom growers by 1996.  It was established by mushroom growers as a co-operative to deliver stability in the marketplace by maintaining the consistency of supply and achieving a sustainable margin for producers, along with improving the overall quality of mushrooms.  During the past ten years, there has been significant rationalisation of the Irish mushroom industry, during which grower numbers have dwindled from approximately 600 to approximately 60.  Today, these growers produce the same amount of mushrooms and we employ 3,500 people.  It should be remembered that those jobs are in rural Ireland and in country parishes.  Due to CMP's programme of consistent improvements since 1999, the farm gate value of mushrooms has increased despite very stiff competition from Europe and volatile exchange rates.<\/p><p> Currently, the 60 growers produce 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms per year, of which 80% or more, worth &euro;120 million at farm gate, is marketed to UK multiples through a network of marketing agents.  For the majority of Irish growers, 100% of their production is exported to the UK.  Irish production equates to over 7% of the total mushrooms produced across Europe.  We now produce more mushrooms than the Germans, Italians and the English.  Only four European countries - the Netherlands, Poland, France and Spain - produce more than Ireland.  It takes over 32 million people to consume the mushrooms produced by Irish mushroom growers.  We are very proud of that.<\/p><p> We have secured almost 60% of the UK multiple market, and that has been hard earned over the past 30 years.  Consumption of mushrooms in the UK is approximately 190,000 tonnes per year.  The English produce approximately 50,000 tonnes and we produce 70,000 tonnes in the South and 20,000 tonnes in the North.  It must be remembered that mushrooms are a perishable product with a relatively short shelf life, produced 52 weeks per year.  The \"best before\" date is five to seven days after harvesting, so the mushrooms must be sold within one or two days of coming from the farms.  There is no viable alternative market for such a highly perishable fresh product and currently the UK is our only market.  We send more than 50 articulated lorry loads to the UK, seven days per week, 365 days per year.  That amounts to 50 40-foot lorries going out of Ireland every day of the week and year.  As a result of the closure of the Russian market, mushrooms from eastern Europe, produced at much lower production costs, are now entering the UK retail market and displacing Irish produce.  With regard to the domestic market, growers supplying Irish retailers produce 14,000 tonnes annually, with Codd Mushrooms making up a large part of that.  These growers now find themselves competing with growers whose produce would normally be destined for the UK export market.<\/p><p> Since the UK vote to leave the EU on 23 June, the mushroom industry in Ireland has been thrown into turmoil and growers are in loss-making territory, resulting from the sudden and significant weakening of sterling.  I will outline why mushroom producers are particularly impacted by the sterling decline.  The marketing companies which sell our mushrooms negotiate our contracts in sterling.  In addition, mushroom prices are forward agreed, generally for contract periods of up to 12 months and longer in some cases.  We mushroom growers are paid in sterling every week.<\/p><p>Twelve months or so ago, when the euro was worth 70p, we would go to the bank with &pound;1 sterling and end up with &euro;1.36.  Today, when we go to the same bank, we get &euro;1.16 for our &pound;1 sterling.  That is on our total sales figure and this is where it is really hurting.<\/p><p> When the UK retailers agreed contract prices with Irish marketing companies, they knew that we were doing well with an exchange rate of 70p or 72p to the euro, hammered down the prices to match it and subsequently paid us accordingly.  Now, however, we have to honour these contracts until they run out.  Our marketing companies, along with Commercial Mushroom Producers, are battling with the UK retailers to get new contracts in place, but they are telling us, as growers, that it is a very slow and painful process.  Unfortunately, there are many European and Eastern European producers ready to supply the UK and there are no guarantees of getting the prices up.  My colleague, Ronnie Wilson, who has been in the UK market for the past 30 years and worked on building up those markets, will articulate later the difficulty of this challenge.  <\/p><p> From where I sit, this is a crisis.  The mushroom business is in free fall.  My wife, Mary, and I have invested all we have and 30 years of our lives in the mushroom industry.  More than 50 families, including our own, depend on our business surviving what I consider is probably the worst slap in the face since we started in 1988.  The impact of Brexit will mean huge losses for every farm trying to stay alive at the moment.  As we have seen in recent weeks, three mushroom farms went out of business since Brexit.  This volatility in the marketplace cannot be sustained.  As I said earlier, and I would like to say it again, 130 jobs are gone so far in the first 100 days of Brexit and &euro;7 million in exports have been lost.  This is something we cannot replace quickly. <\/p><p> A significant and longer term market pressure for Irish producers is the foothold that has been gained in the UK retail market by Polish product in recent times.  This is worrying as their cost base is only a fraction of ours.  For example, their labour rate is 28% of our minimum wage in Ireland.  In the mushroom industry, 40% of our costs is labour.  It is a huge part of our costs.  The Polish producers can produce at 28% of our cost. <\/p><p> The dominant power of the retailers and significant food price deflation in fresh produce have resulted in serious downward price pressure on our mushroom exports, which is now being compounded by the decline in the value of sterling.  As I said, mushroom production is highly labour intensive and the threats now faced by the industry could result in significant job losses.  I keep reminding the committee that we have 3,500 people employed in the mushroom industry in Ireland.  That is, we had 3,500 people employed in the mushroom industry; 130 jobs have been lost.  <\/p><p> It will also impact on the tillage sector, as the mushroom industry is a significant purchaser of wheaten straw, and on the poultry sector, as poultry litter is used in mushroom compost.  There are several other areas that would also be affected.  Take those jobs out of rural and Ireland and see what happens.<\/p><p> In the past, a reduction in production or closure of a mushroom business was generally replaced.  If one farmer closed down, another farmer would extend or put on another mushroom house or two.  They would take it up.  Now, no one has the appetite to build new farms or extend.  Therefore, those jobs and that market share is being lost to Eastern Europe and our competitors.<\/p><p> Recently, the IFA has met with Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture, Deputy Andrew Doyle, to impress on him the immediate need - I stress the word immediate - to take a number of actions to support our mushroom sector in the wake of Brexit and the weakening of sterling.  We also note the recent comments by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Michael Creed, acknowledging the particular issues of the mushroom sector and his commitment to provide support to the sector in the budget process.<\/p><p> The IFA has proposed a number of practical measures.<\/p><p>We need a lifeline.  We need oxygen.  We need to get through a period of time.  The Government must act on our proposals to address the short-term impact of the exchange rate volatility and to support cost competitiveness.<\/p><p> We are hoping the committee will help us ensure the Government pays, as soon as possible, the producer organisation, PO, funding that is due to the commercial mushroom producers, CMPs, for the 2015 programme.  Given that it is 2016, we want it paid as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> A temporary reduction in the lower rate of employer PRSI from 8.5% to 4.25% must be introduced in October's budget.  This would impact directly on employment costs for mushroom producers and other SMEs which have been negatively impacted by the weakening of sterling, and who will not have undertaken hedging or other risk management measures to offset the price decline.  This measure existed between 2011 and 2013 as part of the then Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative.  It must be recognised, however, that this will not have an impact on employment costs where employees are on the higher rate of PRSI.  The IFA believes, therefore, the Government must give consideration to temporarily reducing the higher rate of PRSI for affected sectors.<\/p><p> The Government must consider other measures to reduce employment costs.  In particular, the IFA proposes extending the tax relief measure for start-up companies to existing companies in the mushroom sector.  This would be capped at &euro;15,000 per annum, recognising the limitations imposed by State aid rules for the agriculture sector.  The Government must immediately introduce the renewable heat incentive scheme.  There must be no increase in excise rates on agricultural diesel or other road fuels.<\/p><p> External to the budget process, the IFA believes that there should be no change to the national minimum wage until there is greater certainty on the longer-term exchange rate position between sterling and the euro.  We live in a world of uncertainty at the moment.  The IFA believes direct support should be provided to mushroom producers through Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, market support measures.  The decline of sterling, arising from the UK vote, is a market disturbance which has occurred swiftly and unexpectedly, and has resulted in a significant price fall for the mushroom sector.  Over the past year, the European Commission has provided support for exceptional measures for the dairy, pig meat and other livestock sectors.  Support must be provided directly to mushroom producers for whom an external political event has had an immediate and negative economic impact.<\/p><p> We hope the committee will support the proposals.  It is critical that the threat to the mushroom industry is taken on board as a matter of urgency by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Action is required at national and EU level to underpin the viability of the mushroom industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reilly for his detailed and concise presentation and his proposals for aid to his sector.  The PRSI proposal seems very practical.  Does Mr. Reilly have costings for the proposals such as the PRSI, tax relief and renewable heat incentive?  The Irish producers have been under pressure from Polish product in the UK market and we accept that what has happened is outside the producers' control.  In the vast majority of cases the contracts have eight or ten months to run and are fixed and agreed in sterling.<\/p><p>If producers can get to the point where the contracts have been renewed and we can help them over this serious hump, does Mr. Reilly think the industry will be able to see off the Polish threat?  Mr. Reilly said the number of growers has reduced very significantly over recent years and one worry is that they are losing market share to Polish suppliers who have the same problems with sterling as we have.  Irish suppliers have been losing market share.  We should persuade the Government to step in and help the industry.  Unless we step in, the industry will not survive so it has to get help immediately.  I hope when the contracts are renewed the industry will be back to profitability.  Will Mr. Reilly comment on the significant threat from the Polish side?  Are there costings on the different initiatives to address that threat?

He is aware that a significant number of mushroom producers in the Westmeath area have disappeared, so to speak, in the past 12 or 18 months.  They were all under pressure prior to this.  It is a perfect storm because it is a very perishable product in a volatile market.  There was forward contracting when the sterling rate was at a particular level and now it has collapsed so the industry is caught in a bind.  The attrition rate will significantly accelerate unless there is intervention.  There has to be recognition of that at national and EU level.  Apart from all the other measures, the PRSI job initiative introduced by the Government over recent years worked so it can be readily dusted down and brought into play fairly quickly.  That will only get the industry so far.  There were worrying reports that diesel prices will become equivalent to petrol prices.  If that happens, the industry will be gone altogether.  I agree there cannot be any increase in excise rates on agricultural diesel over the next 12 to 18 months while people get back on their feet.<\/p> <p>  If we make a submission to Government on behalf of the industry, we have to know that it is all right to do so on a broad basis and in a generic way.  What are the costs involved in each specific measure we are seeking to establish to help address issues in the short term?  Is there any reason, with only three months left in 2016, producers have not received their money for 2015?  Is it a failure on the producers' behalf to submit the relevant forms?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine makes great play of paying out on time so I am surprised to see the producers are that far behind.  There is not a big number of producers; there are only 53.  There is no reason for that.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the worst case scenario.  The industry has lost three or four mushroom companies in recent weeks.  If there is no intervention, what does Mr. Reilly see as the future of the mushroom industry in Ireland?  How many people are employed in the industry and what impact will there be on employment?  There would be a substantial cost to the Exchequer at that level so it would be prudent to include it in the valuation scales and ensure the appropriate aid is given to secure the future of the industry on a short-term basis until this matter is resolved.  I do not want to be pessimistic but what concerns me is that the currency could continue on its downward spiral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#K00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>What also concerns me is that people are talking about the British exit from the EU taking two years.

There will be a knock-on effect and a loss of jobs if action is not taken.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Reilly&rsquo;s report and note with interest the requests it contains.  Has the mushroom business taken any action or changed its marketing strategy in any way?

The delegation said that there have already been casualties and that existing growers are not extending their operations to take up the slack.

There was also a crisis in 2008 and 2009.<\/p><p>We asked our customers for price increases and got them.  Back in 2008 and 2009, the big four, as they are known in the UK, were in buoyant humour.  They were expanding and making good profits and there was food inflation.  Today is a completely different situation with food deflation.  During that intervening period, we have seen the growth of the discounters and the big four, who were buoyant in 2008 and 2009, are now in trouble.  I could lift up a newspaper and read that if it is not one, it is another that is in trouble.  They are not really in trouble but they are in trouble relative to where they were some years ago.  They will not countenance price increases and we do not know how we are going to push prices up at the moment.  We have been pushing them hard over the past month and they are refusing to budge.<\/p><p> We have the Polish threat.  We are not quite sure how big a threat it is.  Polish mushrooms formerly went to Russia.  As a result of the Russian embargo, these mushrooms are now being pushed further west and Polish mushrooms are flooding the markets of France, Germany and the Benelux countries.  Some are coming to the UK.  The Polish industry is split into two parts consisting of eastern and western Poland.  The industry in western Poland was under some pressure but is now buoyant because the distance from western Poland to the UK is a two-day drive.  Only one of the four large British supermarkets purchases Polish mushrooms but we are afraid that this is the tip of the iceberg.  We believe the Poles will not offer a threat in the long term because the fresh produce business involves supply lines and the shorter the supply line, the better it is for customers because people are looking for fresh mushrooms.  If supply lines are long and the weather changes, there will be a build-up of mushrooms in the stores and the consumer looks at them and says, \"End of shelf life; don't buy.\".  We hope that over time, the Polish threat can be overcome.  At the moment, we face the discounters and deflation and the concept of cheap food is politically very acceptable.<\/p><p> That is about all I have to say.  I am prepared to answer any other questions.  The situation is very difficult.  If we let the industry go into freefall, that will be a disaster because we are already unable to supply all our contracts.  We are purchasing mushrooms in Poland and Holland to service our UK contracts.  We can continue to do that for a little while but not for very long.<\/p><p> In 2008 and 2009, the Irish mushroom industry was transformed from a cottage industry to a highly professional and fully invested industry.  Most people do not realise that setting up a mushroom farm employing 60 people costs &euro;4 million.  There are mushroom farms in Ireland that are really businesses.  We do not know where we can go to make the next move.  In 2008 and 2009, we invested using producer organisation, PO, money and we created a mushroom industry in Ireland that was able to compete with mushroom industries throughout Europe.  The one thing we must do is stop people closing if that is at all possible because contracts will be under threat.  UK retailers believe in the Irish mushroom industry.  The Irish mushroom industry has served them very well.  They are now being let down.  These guys expect 100% service levels and if these service levels do not come through, they will look elsewhere.  We must stop the industry from going into freefall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronnie Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Codd want to make a contribution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I deliberately left Mr. Codd until now to discuss the PRSI measures and to take up some of Deputy Penrose's questions on input costs and what we are going to do about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There is also the question of the 2015 moneys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I might come back to Mr. McGovern to answer that one as he is chairman of CMP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>That is no problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>To discuss the PRSI situation, we analysed our 225 staff members to see how many were being paid at a point where the lower PRSI rate was applicable.  It was only 10%.  It may seem very beneficial, but realistically the industry needs assistance on the 10.75% employer's PRSI rate.  Mr. Wilson has been using the term \"free fall\", which is very apt.  To put things in perspective, there has been a reduction of probably 17% to 18% in price within the space of a number of weeks.  Mushroom growers exist on a very low margin.  I imagine growers are used to making a margin of between 5% and 8%.  When there is a price reduction of that much, one does what one can, but there is only so much one can do.  In fairness to Monaghan Mushrooms and Walsh Mushrooms, they have come in with some assistance, but they can only do so much too because they are also on tight margins.  Whatever has been done is all that can be done by the industry.  We all run tight ships and do not have waste.  We are now at a point where we see very little hope without Government assistance.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on another point in the submission, which is the renewable heat incentive.  It has been mooted within Government over the past number of years that a renewable heat incentive scheme will start.  It has certainly been expected for the past two years.  A scheme was introduced in England a number of years ago as well as in Northern Ireland and it has proved very successful in the reduction of emissions and reliance on non-renewable energy sources.  I urge the committee to expedite a scheme if it can or, at least, give us the parameters of what levels can be used to assist people to convert to renewable energy.

What are the IFA's proposals at European level?  This is not a new issue; it has been around for years.  The big multiples and corporations are clearly not paying the prices that are required.

A number of questions have been asked and I have additional ones.  I am not clear about the producer organisation funding.  Is this purely Government funding or is it co-funded by the EU?  Why is there a delay with it?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Codd spoke about the renewable heat incentive.  Our EU heat and energy obligations guide the direction of Government policy in this regard, but it also requires capital investment by producers.  Have some people been doing that, or are any producers and business owners currently sourcing sustainable or renewable energy?  Is that commonplace or has it not been possible to do so?  Is there an appetite to invest in renewable heating solutions other than conventional ones?  Has capital investment occurred and, if not, when might it happen?  <\/p> <p>  At the outset, it was clearly explained that 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms are exported to the UK market annually.  It strikes me, and Mr. Wilson touched on this, that Poland is considerably further away from the UK than Ireland is - it is two days away for lorries.  With new technology, including packaging and transport solutions, is it possible to seek other markets?  Mr. Wilson said he has to take in some Polish mushrooms to meet the demands of existing contracts.  Is that a fall-out from producers that have closed?  Why has that come about now?  Is it as a direct result of closures?  <\/p> <p>  We also have new market issues with beef and other agricultural commodities.  Government policy is aimed at finding new markets or assisting producers to find them.  We cannot get away from Brexit and I know the mushroom sector is so dependent on the British market, but would it be viable for producers to consider exporting beyond the British market?<\/p> <p>  Have producers made a case for the CAP market support measures?  Have they contacted the European Commission or the Minister about it?  This is happening in other agricultural sectors, but I understand the mushroom sector's dilemma.<\/p><p>There is a problem in the agriculture sector that I call externalising the cost.  The supermarkets put the stuff on the shelves and someone else is paying for it.  Obviously the producer pays but Government supports and everything else make it cheap, yet they dictate the price.  It seems to be a capitalist type of dilemma.  It is the open market but it is not a true market because it is supported.  Where do we go?<\/p><p> Coupled with that is the astounding amount of food that is wasted and how that feeds into the debate about food production.  I was present at a meeting where somebody knowledgeable explained that a funny-shaped tomato is regarded as ugly and does not make grade one although it tastes the same as another tomato.  These are the things producers contend with when making the grade and meeting the demands of the supermarket multiples which want the produce to look pretty as well as taste right.  Is that sustainable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#O00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for allowing me to sit in on this discussion.

I am sure this is a particularly stressful time for everybody in the industry when external factors over which they have very little control can determine the future.

It is an especially difficult issue for the industry and for a county such as Monaghan.  No county is more exposed to this crisis.

As everyone here knows, there are two issues regarding retail regulation the domestic and the EU pictures.  The EU picture has a greater impact because of the amount of produce exported throughout the EU.<\/p><p>Our position is very clear.  As Members know regulations have been brought in at domestic level to ensure there are contracts between suppliers and retailers, that these contracts are transparent and have fair terms of trade attached to them.  Initially, we are saying these contracts have just been brought in.  The Competition Commission has been charged with enforcing them.  We need to see the Commission being active so as to ensure the types of practices that we all know went on in the past, such as pay for play and pay for shelf positioning and other very unfair terms of practice, will not be allowed to be continued.  We would like to see the regulations strengthened further.  We have clearly outlined there needs to be an independent ombudsman and the whole issue of below-cost selling needs to be looked at again.  Below-invoice selling is still happening.  It is as simple as fresh produce being used as a loss leader by retailers to bring in customers and that impacts in the long run on the price the supplier or the producer receives.  Up until now, there has been a reluctance at EU level to talk about anything other than voluntary codes of conduct.  We, together with other farming organisations in Europe, are very clear that this is insufficient and there must be an EU regulation to try to make the market more transparent.  The prices that are received at each level along the supply chain are completely masked at present or are not transparent enough and we need to make that clearer.  That will strengthen the bargaining position of suppliers.<\/p><p> Our position at present is about shining light on the various links in the supply chain to ensure that suppliers have a better position in which to bargain to try to get a fair price and return on their produce.  <\/p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of the minimum wage.  It is a fair question.  The minimum wage is a figure that sets and determines other wages as well.  An increase in the minimum wage clearly or bluntly has an impact on increasing labour costs.  That is an increase in employment costs, whether it is the direct wage increase but it impacts on other costs, such as PRSI and so on.  It is not ideological but a position based on practicality that the costs of employment cannot and should not be increased at this point.  The witnesses who have contributed have highlighted the severe pressure the industry is under and therefore it is very much a proposal or statement based on the very difficult position in which the industry finds itself.  Instead of being an entrenched ideological position, the position is that an increase in wages is an increase in the employment costs and could jeopardise employment numbers.  Unfortunately, the position is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rowena Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I asked whether the IFA had engaged with the Department of Social Protection on subsiding particular sectors as an alternative to not increasing the minimum wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#Q00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We have not engaged with the Department of Social Protection on the question of family income supplement.

We are aware that it operated for a short period under a temporary EU state aid framework.  We have considered existing measures that could be tweaked in the immediate term.  I am aware that other sectors of the food industry have looked at whether the employment subsidy scheme that existed in 2009 and 2010 could be reintroduced.  The reason the scheme is not to the forefront of our proposals is due to the fact that it existed under an EU state aid framework that no longer exists.  I apologise to the Senator for misinterpreting his question.<\/p> <p>  The final question was on CAP market support measures.  We have identified what exists under the single Common Market organisation as a possibility to provide support to the fruit and vegetable sector that has been impacted by a market disturbance.  We will pursue the matter.  We expect, based on evidence relating to the dairy and pigmeat sectors, that a solution may take time.

I shall return to the points raised by Senator Mulherin.  First, she referred to alternative markets and asked us to bear in mind Polish production.  We have an amazing market that took us 30 years to build up. Some 3,500 people work in the sector.  Mushrooms account for one third of the horticulture sector.  The value of mushrooms at the farm gate is almost double that of potatoes.  We have exported mushrooms.  The success of the mushroom sector stems from reaching a market of 50 million people and it would be great to go further.  Obviously, one learns from an occasion such as this.  One will try to expand one's market in the future but we will fight tooth and nail now to hold on to our market and we are here today to secure a lifeline.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked why producer organisation, PO, funding has not been paid.  Just to put everyone in the picture, producer groups are set up to help the producer get closer to the marketplace.  These groups have been set up all across Europe.  There is very good funding available of up to &euro;900 million from the budget in Europe.  The aim is to get producers of fruit and vegetables closer to the marketplace.  I do not know why PO funding is not paid.  We have asked for the 2015 money and perhaps the Senator can say something to the right people in order that we might secure it.  It is EU money that is policed and administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I hope we will get a payment soon.

In 1989 I erected three mushroom tunnels with Foxfield Mushrooms so I used to know an awful lot about the mushroom industry.  I worked there for many years.  I also worked for Walsh Mushrooms and interacted with growers across the midlands and the west.  I often visited Mr. Reilly's yard.  Therefore, I am very conscious of the sector.<\/p><p>At that time it was an industry in which three to seven tunnels was the average on a farm and farmers would employ a number of housewives in the locality.  That was how the system worked.  It has matured and developed a lot since then and has grown into a very big business in which there are fewer growers.  In a sense, that is what makes it more vulnerable.  Many mushroom farmers are heavily indebted, having invested hugely in their businesses, and the current price volatility is putting them under serious pressure.<\/p><p> At the time of the Brexit referendum it was said that the result could have a hugely negative effect on businesses that were exporting to Britain, particularly agrifood businesses.  In the mushroom business in the mid-1980s, a person who got 50p for a pound was doing okay, 55p meant he or she was flying but anything below 50p meant that person was in serious trouble.  Sterling was always a problem and there was always some fluctuation in the currency.<\/p><p> I fully appreciate the demand for a reduction in employers' PRSI but that could be problematic in the context of state aid rules if it is done for one sector but not for others.  While I am not trying to foresee problems, that could be a difficult obstacle to overcome.  At the time of the Brexit vote I spoke to the Taoiseach and urged him to go to the European Union and ask that a special fund be put in place for small Irish enterprises which will be very negatively affected by what has happened in another EU state.  What happened is not our responsibility but many our businesses will be in serious jeopardy because of it.  There is still a case to be made for such a fund and if we structure the request properly, we will get a fair hearing from the European Commission.  A fund should be put in place to protect businesses.<\/p><p> We do not know what will happen because Article 50 has not been triggered yet.  Once that is triggered we will know where we are going.  In the meantime, some structure should be put in place that gets around those EU rules about state intervention in the market.  There is a clear reason for such intervention.  We have an industry which is already established and employing people.  We are not trying to set up something new.  The industry is here already and doing very well.  There is a strong case to be made by the Irish authorities for a fund to be put in place by the EU to help Irish businesses.  The mushroom sector could benefit very much from that.<\/p><p> In the long term the mushroom industry will survive and will continue to flourish and grow.  However, it will experience difficulties, as is the case now.  Most of the difficulties, as in the example given regarding Poland, are external.  While I know that the building boom caused difficulties in terms of wage inflation, most of the factors inhibiting the industry are external.  There is a strong case to be made that in the aftermath of Brexit, the European Commission would put a fund in place to support Irish small businesses.  Alternatively, the EU could set aside some of the rules around state intervention, given the special circumstances.  Those arguments need to be made.<\/p><p> The issue of the use of wood chip was raised and I know that similar issues arise in the poultry industry.  There are differences in the cost of production north and south of the Border because farmers in the North can use wood chip boilers, which keeps their costs of production low because the fuel is heavily subsidised.  The same issue is relevant to the mushroom industry and such a system needs to be brought in here.  It is a clear no-brainer because it ticks all of the environmental boxes.  I fully support the delegates in this regard.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses and apologise for not being here earlier but I had to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber for a priority question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#R01000","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I do not want to go back over issues that have been discussed.

My estimation is that if all these measures were implemented, they still would not offset the reductions this year.  The witnesses estimate the potential losses this year at &euro;10 million.  Therefore, even if all these measures were implemented, they still would be looking at a loss of over &euro;2 million this year alone.  While this may be temporary, there is no sign of the decline of sterling reversing or levelling off.  What is the IFA's long-term view on the exchange rate?  What impact will that have in terms of improving the position?  Even if all these measures were put in place, there would still be a crisis.  Also, it seems from what Mr. Wilson said earlier that the potential for opening up new markets within the European Union does not exist, given the distances they have to travel and the challenges with regard to the Polish mushroom producers.<\/p> <p>  Any CAP market support measures would have to be introduced on an EU-wide level to ensure it benefited the Polish producers, which would improve their competitiveness in the English market also.

They stated also that labour costs are 40% of the production costs.

I can inform the Senator in response to another very good question she asked that Irish mushroom producers have embraced renewable technology in line with the scale of their mushroom production units.  The decision each producer makes on whether renewable technology is worthwhile depends on whether the price of oil and the price of wood, which is the used biomass, is high or low in the year in which that decision is made.  I changed to renewables on my farm in 2007 because it was beneficial for me at the time.  At the moment, it would not be beneficial for me to do it because of the price of oil.  It would not really make as much financial sense as it did a number of years ago.  The incentive for large-scale farms is reasonably okay.  When the gap between oil and wood is large, the smaller farms would really need an incentive before they would consider converting over.  The capital cost is quite large.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether it would be difficult for farms to finance such a conversion.  A farm producing &euro;100,000 of product each week could be looking at a capital cost of &euro;200,000.  If the RHI scheme was in operation and farms were getting a reasonably fixed amount of aid on their heat for 15 or 20 years, based on the number of kilowatt hours they use, it would be very bankable.  I do not think it would be a problem for small and large producers to embrace this.  I know that the levels which should be paid in respect of various ages and scales of heating systems are up for discussion.  The scheme that was introduced in Northern Ireland was probably a little over-generous.  A scheme like the UK scheme would be better.  I understand that there is some wastage of heat in the North.  Nobody wants to see that.  People who are interested in embracing renewables have made submissions on the scale at which that should be done in each industry and the level of grant aid that should be provided for each scale of boiler.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leslie Codd"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I would like to make a few points about sterling.  I will try to be brief.  There is no predicting what way sterling is going to go.  The only thing one can say is that the risks would be on the down side.  I will explain what I mean by that.  The reality is that the economic impact of the Brexit vote has not yet filtered into the consumer economy in the UK.  It is a case of steady as she goes.  Obviously, the market has priced in a negative outlook for the UK economy.  That is what we saw with the sudden depreciation.  Now we seem to be sticking at a level of between 86p and 87p to the euro.  Until the negotiations start and we see how they proceed, we will not know whether there will be further weakening of sterling.  I have to say at this point that sterling would not be expected to bounce back positively in the short term.  There is potential for sterling to weaken further over the short to medium term.  It has been suggested that given our presence in and reliance on the UK market, it might be possible to go into another market at some point.  Having listened to the presentation today, I would like to say two things in response to that.  It took many years to build up our market in the UK.<\/p><p>While there are competitive forces and so on at play, I know it is a market the mushroom sector will not give up easily.  Those involved will work very hard to protect it.  Not only that, in common with the rest of the agricultural sector, the position that the IFA and farmers have taken following the Brexit vote is that the industry needs support to promote our produce on the United Kingdom market.  That would enable us to maintain, as far as possible, the share we have with consumers, as well as provide support to look to new markets.  The issue is that these things will take time.<\/p><p> What has been presented today is the immediate impact on an important industry in Ireland.  This industry is extraordinarily innovative and has a positive future, but it is facing immediate challenges.  It needs support to maintain feasibility in the short term and to allow it to work on the market share in the United Kingdom as well as on diversifying into other markets.  That is not something that can be done in the immediate term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rowena Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Deputy D'Arcy asked a question on savings already secured.

Sterling was losing value at an unprecedented rate.  CMP formed a policy that involved the industry coming together to try to do what it possibly could to save itself in light of the free fall.  In fairness, most of the industry has come together and given support.  The marketing companies have given reasonable support, as much as they possibly can within the lines of their profit margins.  One has given price support per kilogram.  Another extremely good measure was price support in light of currency devaluation.  The subvention did two things.  First, it got money to growers immediately.  Second, it was the first action to put a little confidence back in to the industry from the grower point of view.  These actions and the actions of others from the supply base were necessary.  They are holding the growers for a term.  However, as Mr. Reilly had said, we have already lost three units and 150 jobs.  Unfortunately, six more companies are not in a good financial position.  I hope it will not happen but if we do not get some measures together quickly enough, we could lose a further 300 jobs.  Action is needed now rather than what could or should happen.  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to getting intervention from Europe.  That is definitely a positive proposal and something that certainly should be done with a total push behind it.  However, as we all know, when we go to Europe we are talking about time, and time is not on our side.  We need assistance now.  That is the reason we are coming up with these measures.  These are measures we believe can be delivered in a relatively short time.  Deputy Penrose made a comment in this regard.  It is not enough to plug the full gap.  The full haemorrhage is approximately &euro;22 million, as someone said earlier, from where most contracts were negotiated to where we are now with the exchange rate.  Of course, it is not enough but we have to start somewhere.  We need to continue building and get confidence and keep the confidence for growers to hang in there.  They have the sure and certain knowledge that our product is good enough to stand up to scrutiny in any supermarket.  Certainly, the product is not a problem.  It is a question of what we can do until we sail out of this storm.  We need whatever help we possibly can get now or else we will have further haemorrhaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l McGovern"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGovern very much.

I suggested earlier that we should perhaps be looking at sectors which export 80% or 85% of their produce to the UK as a reason for their being supported.  Yes, it will take the 10.5% rate, and it still needs to be \"boxed-in\" - if I dare use the term - to try to get a way where we can funnel this other rate of PRSI into the exporting sector.

This is a valuable opportunity to examine the 2016 Estimate for my Department and consider the mid-year expenditure and programme indicator outturns, where they are available.  I am also happy to outline my priority areas for expenditure in the three year period 2017 to 2019 and would welcome the committee's views on the opportunities and priorities in the areas of agriculture, food and the marine for the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to &euro;1.363 billion in 2016, being &euro;1.134 billion for current expenditure and &euro;229 million for capital expenditure, including a carryover of &euro;12 million in capital funding.  In addition to the Department Vote, in 2016 Ireland will receive some &euro;1.2 billion in direct funding from the European Union for the basic payment scheme.  This brings the combined investment in Irish agriculture, food and the marine to more than &euro;2.5 billion in 2016.  At the end of June, the Department had spent a total of &euro;450.4 million of voted expenditure, which was 93% of profiled expenditure of &euro;485.1 million.  On current expenditure, the Department had spent &euro;346.5 million out of a profiled expenditure of &euro;375.9 million, representing a figure of 92% of profiled current expenditure.  On capital expenditure, the Department had spent &euro;103.8 million out of profiled expenditure of &euro;109.1 million, representing a figure of 95% of profiled capital expenditure.  Appropriations-in-aid amounted to &euro;162.2 million out of profiled receipts of &euro;164.9 million, representing a figure of 98% of profiled receipts.<\/p> <p>  The increase in funding this year is allowing the Department to progress the key priorities which I identified when we met the committee last June.  Looking ahead to the remainder of this year and into the 2017 to 2019 period, I am conscious that there are a number of challenges to be faced.  These include Brexit, continuing poor returns in the dairy sector, access to finance, programme for Government commitments in respect of the new &euro;25 million sheep scheme and the progressive implementation of the rural development plan and the seafood development plan.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;4 billion 2014-2020 rural development programme is designed to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of the agrisector and is co-funded by the European Union.  Rural development programme schemes provide vital investment to capital in the rural economy, prioritise agri-environmental protection, support the incomes of family farms and will be a key driver of the additional funding which will be required by the Department for next year.  As the committee is aware, a number of schemes were opened last year under the new programme and their continued roll-out will require additional investment and support.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the &euro;241 million seafood development operational programme is a vital element of Government policy and will support the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the seafood sector up to 2020 to maximise its contribution to jobs and growth in coastal communities and to the national economy.<\/p><p>Built on a smart foundation of knowledge, training and applied research, the programme seeks to grow the industry sustainably through building scale, fostering competitiveness, adding value, new product development and output growth.<\/p><p> The Government, through Food Wise 2025, is targeting an increase in employment of 2,000 in the seafood industry by 2025 and an increase in the value of exports by the sector to &euro;1.2 billion.  The operational programme will support the investments by industry in increased production and exports that will bring about the achievement of these targets.<\/p><p> As committee members will be aware, there are many competing demands across all Departments and only a finite amount of money is available in the 2017 fiscal space.  The agrifood sector is an important engine for growth in rural areas, providing valuable jobs to rural communities and contributing to the wider economy.  The sector continues to play a considerable role in our economic recovery and has continued to prove its fundamental importance as a cornerstone of the economy and life in rural Ireland.<\/p><p> The sector remains lreland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry and provides valuable employment, particularly in rural and coastal areas where few other job opportunities exist.  We will continue to make our case for increased funding as part of the Estimates process.  I look forward to engaging with members of the committee on areas where we could consider prioritising expenditure in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#Y00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank them for the reports which were supplied in advance of the meeting.

The Minister indicated that current expenditure is running at 92% of profile, which is about &euro;30 million less than was forecast at the start of the year.  Current expenditure is now &euro;346 million while the profile indicated &euro;375 million.

Does the Minister expect that by the end of the year there will be an underspend in the Department which may give him funding for more scope with certain measures next year?<\/p> <p>  Based on projections at the start of this year, how are payments now running under the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP?  I know that numbers in the scheme are far fewer than what was budgeted for.  Some 35,000 were budgeted for, while only 25,000 are in the scheme.  The same situation applies to payments under this year's budget for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Will the Minister assess the capacity for improving the uptake of these schemes next year?  As regards the BDGP scheme, is there a potential to use unspent funds to increase payments per cow, either next year or as we approach the mid-term Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, review?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the &euro;11 million of co-funding which is an option for the Government under the &euro;350 million EU fund?

The Minister will need to provide &euro;11 million in order to ensure that &euro;22 million will be available otherwise it will hardly be worth fighting over.<\/p> <p>  A total of 120,000 people get the single farm scheme payment.  Is the Minister concerned that corporate farmers are some of the biggest recipients of the single farm payment?  I have been fighting that for years.  The nice black hair of taxpayers must go grey when they see that happening.  Genuine farmers cannot get anything and if they do they are penalised by 1%, 2% or 3% for a small error.  It is very easy for a corporate farmer not to have any errors.

It was never intended for large corporate farmers or anybody else.  It is about time that we had a proportionate distribution that reflects the reality for the 100,000 farmers who are trying to survive.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the Minister has appealed the decision in the O'Connor case on the appeals system to the Supreme Court.  How is the Department treating that?  Why would the Minister appeal something we indicated we had concerns about in the past?  Is it not time to bring the 2001 Act into 2017 to make it real and effective and ensure it operates a system that is fair to all concerned?  Is it intended to amend the 2001 Act?  If it is will the Minister ensure that we have an input into that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#AA00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy McConalogue's question on the profiling of expenditure, it is important to remember that the figures presented to the committee are the six month figures for the outturns to the end of June.  There is no reason for alarm at this stage in respect of the profiled expenditure to the end of the year.<\/p><p>It is a difficult Department to manage in that many of the payments are demand led.  Many of them go out of the end of the year.  It is a management challenge to ensure we match expenditure with provision in the Department, but at this stage we are quite happy that our expenditure is on target.<br\/><br\/>One thing that would have skewed the capital expenditure to the end of June is that the World Food Programme payment of &euro;20 million, which is usually made in the first six months, was not made until the early weeks of July.  That would bring expenditure close to being exactly where we wanted it.  We are, broadly speaking, on target.  This is an ongoing issue in respect of managing the finances.  We have a good track record in the Department of spending every penny that is provided to us and that is a challenge we continue to track to ensure we deliver the best possible outcomes for the fishing and farming communities that we serve.<br\/><br\/>On the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, our profiled expenditure on that up to the end of June was &euro;2 million ahead of schedule.  We are quite satisfied with the level of provision.  Based on the broad statistics, we have in excess of 24,000 in the scheme already.  We will make many payments in December on that scheme.  I know many of the members were at the National Ploughing Championships.  If they were in the Teagasc, Bord Bia or Department tents, they will have seen that one of the things we are constantly pushing on the BDGP is the requirement for recipient farmers to complete the carbon navigator task because that is a precondition to receiving the payment and it is part of the original <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre<\/i>of the scheme.  We are on target.  By 20 September 11,500 had completed the carbon navigation task, but of the 24,000 in the scheme quite a few have yet to do it.  We expect that we will be paying that out as provided for.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked, and the IFA too has raised the issue with me and my colleagues, about additional payment for suckler cows.  Two issues arise.  One, it would require an amendment to the scheme which has been approved under the rural development programme and that is a cumbersome process, and two, it would also incur additional tasks for farmers.  The BDGP scheme as constructed is quite an innovative and progressive scheme.  I think Deputy Penrose would agree.  I watched his performance in committee recently.  Even sceptics of the scheme have come around to it and recognise the potential for it to achieve what the economic breeding index, EBI, has done on the dairy side.  There is no intention on my side or that of the Department to seek to impose an additional obligation on farmers in respect of doing something for suckler cows.  For those in the scheme, that would also skew the payments and would cause difficulties in respect of our ambition to open the scheme to others.  There is provision of &euro;300 million in the lifetime of the rural development programme for the scheme.  Long before I or my predecessor arrived there was a record of drawing down every penny on schemes.  We do not leave money behind in Europe and will not do so in respect of this scheme.  We would prefer to do that in a fashion that allows more in rather than paying more for more complicated tasks which it would take some time to have approved and about which it is a big question whether the Commission would desire it.  We are better off sticking with the construct of the scheme and getting more people into it.<br\/><br\/>On the &euro;11 million co-funding, prior to this meeting I had a meeting with my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter of co-funding and several other matters relating to the budget.  That is a legitimate question.  We still hope that will be possible.  We have not thrown in the towel on that.  The precedent is there for co-funding.<br\/><br\/>I might take with that the related question from Deputy Penrose on the dairy scheme generally.  There are in the region of 4,000 applications, so approximately one in four dairy farmers have applied for it.<\/p><p>If the payment is made as envisaged, at 14 cent per litre, it would approximate a benefit of &euro;11 million for farmers.  That is if my recollection of figures is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#AA00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Is that the reduction scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>This is on the supply reduction measure.  The &euro;150 million scheme for Europe was not ring-fenced for an individual producer.  It appears there may be difficulty in having a second and third tranche, as envisaged by the Commission.  With the level of interest in the first tranche, it may utilise the full space and there may not be a second tranche.  That remains a Commission decision.  We know the level of interest in Ireland and it looks as if that is the envisaged figure.<\/p><p>A number of members have raised the sheep scheme.  That was constructed in consultation with the farm organisations.  I personally met representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers Association, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers and Macra na F&eacute;irme.  My officials subsequently had very detailed discussions about the detail of the scheme.  It is &euro;25 million and, as Deputy Penrose has alluded to, if one does the maths on the number of ewes, it works out approximately as a payment of &euro;10 per ewe.  The EU requirement is for a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for the &euro;10 and there must be an equivalence in effort.  We have been trying to design a scheme that meets the EU requirement but takes into account the various husbandry practices, both for lowland and hill sheep farmers.  We have a reasonable scheme and we await EU approval.  The ambition is to have applications invited for early 2017, with payment in the same year.<\/p><p>There will be a menu of options.  If the four or five star ram does not suit a particular need, there are other options, such as scanning.  We have put a suite of measures to the Commission and we hope they will all stack up to the scrutiny that will be applied.  They have been constructed in consultation with the farm organisations.  Every farmer will be given a menu from which he or she may choose elements that will suit.<\/p><p>Deputy McConalogue asked about aquaculture licences.  I am aware of the inordinate delays with these and we have discussed the issue previously, as Deputy Pringle raised the matter as well.  It was raised with me yesterday in Killybegs.  There is a legal background to this in terms of court findings against the State and the wriggle room we were given in order to get our house in order.  We are working through a very considerable task of getting assessment done in all the bays.  At the end of the exercise, the objective for the seafood sector is surely to get the industry somewhere near its potential.  We are at an abysmally low level in what we achieve.  The legal issue with the Commission arose from our non-compliance with the habitats and birds directive but apart from that I have committed to establishing a review of the aquaculture licensing system here, as it takes an extraordinarily long time.  I am familiar with one case where the licence was applied for in 2011 but the operation is still not off the ground; the licence was granted but the appeals process is ongoing.  The issue is very complex.  We have approximately 10,000 tonnes or 11,000 tonnes of farmed fish but Scotland produces approximately 100,000 tonnes and the Norwegians produce more than 1 million tonnes.  That is an indication of how far behind the curve we are.  If could get our house in order in dealing with the interests in the matter, we could have a significant economic benefit from it.<\/p><p>Deputy Penrose raised two matters generally relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.<\/p><p>One was on the single farm payment and \"corporate farmers\", as he described them.  This issue was the subject of much debate when the current CAP was being put in place.  We sought a lower cap but, unfortunately, the Commission was having none of it.  The Deputy would have seen figures in newspapers recently that included CAP and greening.  There is a cap of &euro;150,000 on single farm payments, which is significantly lower than was previously allowed.  A process is under way on convergence, whereby those who have high per hectare payments are moving back towards an average and those with lower payments are moving up.  This is the first attempt at some modicum of fairness and is a good start.  There are casualties in the process, but it has been a step in the right direction.<\/p><p> We have lodged an appeal in the O'Connor case on foot of legal advice.  It raises interesting questions for which the Deputy would understand the rationale.  For example, the finding suggested that we should even pay in respect of ineligible land regardless of EU regulations prohibiting that.  There are other aspects of the finding that we are conscious of and have reflected on and that have resulted in some change in our practices, but the court ruling is the subject of an appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#CC00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Can the Government not change the 2001 Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#DD00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I am not sure.

Unlike the previous package, which was targeted at the dairy and pigmeat sectors with a provision for a top-up for young farmers, this fund is available across the broader community with the specific exclusion, interestingly enough in light of the current difficulties, of the tillage sector.  We are exploring ways to use the fund.  Given the number of farmers who would be entitled to a slice of it if we went down the same road as the previous package, which was targeted more towards the dairy sector, the fund would be spread too thinly to have any effect.

Given the income crisis in all sectors, whatever the Government or the Department does, it must try to get the available funding to inside the farm gate.  That is essential.  Deputy McConalogue made points on the beef genomics scheme.  Regarding the beef discussion groups, consider the restrictions and the requirement that one must sell cattle to factories to qualify for payment.<\/p><p>All those bullet points need to be re-examined to allow the maximum number of farmers to benefit.<\/p><p> While the Minister was waiting outside we heard from representatives of the horticulture and mushroom sectors about the huge difficulties in those sectors and the tillage sector generally.  How will all these issues be addressed?  <\/p><p> Currently there is a delay in payments from the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and a huge cashflow pressure on farmers.  They have returned all their paperwork to Johnstown Castle but still there is no sign of the payment coming through. <\/p><p> Another point that has been made to me is about the restoration of the full level of funding under the areas of natural constraints scheme, that is, the old disadvantaged areas scheme.  It is essential that we get the level of funding back up.  We have projected into the future when this funding will be restored.  We need it restored immediately.  That would be a simple way of getting funding back for farmers in the most disadvantaged areas in the country. <\/p><p> I am looking at the allocations to Bord Bia in the scheme.  We have heard about the problems in the mushroom sector today, which were very well presented to us.  There is no focus at the moment on the challenges that might be facing the beef sector.  Some 50% of our cattle are still going to the UK.  We fought for a generation to keep south American cattle from finding their way onto the European market.  A decision was taken in the UK in the past couple of months and it can now do a trade deal without any hindrance from the rest of the European Union.  It is not when that happens that we should be considering the implications of it.  The ball will fall in Bord Bia's court if pressure comes on that market to identify alternative markets for cattle.  We had the first shipment of cattle to Turkey in the past couple of weeks.  That we have only one boat available to take cattle live out of the country is a huge encumbrance.  We need to focus on our live export trade.  I suggest Bord Bia would need more funding so that, if the UK tries to source beef from south America, we are not in a position like that of the horticulture and mushroom men who were here with us an hour or so ago and whose industry is in complete crisis.  <\/p><p> The Minister spoke about the cessation scheme.  I did not fully understand what he was saying when he spoke about the funding coming from it, the number of farmers who had applied and that it looks like only the first tranche will be taken up.

The evidence is laid before us.  The mushroom growers recently came before us.  This puts pressure on the Minister for programmes and schemes to supplement farmers' incomes.  Where I live, if farmers do not receive the single farm payment, or if the Minister does not introduce programmes, they make no income.  They are eating into the money the Department pays them to keep their farms going.  It is unsustainable and there have been many debates about the external causes.  We touched on it with the mushroom producers earlier.  The farmers and producers all seem to point back to the factory or the multiple retailer.  Farmers seem to be totally at their mercy.  These companies and big corporations seem to be in a dominant position, at least collectively.<\/p> <p>  While we can talk about the open market, the irony is that the Irish and European taxpayer is supplementing the price at which these corporations sell their produce on the supermarket shelf.  The mushroom growers told us their fresh food is being sold as a loss leader.  This can apply to alcohol and milk, and taxpayers' money subsidises it.  Something is not right in that equation, and it keeps coming back to the Minister as a crisis.  I understand there are complexities and it is all about good quality food for consumers, but it is also about lining the pockets of big corporations and the taxpayer paying.  Is there any hope that there will be a different model in the future?  I imagine we are not just talking about Ireland.  There must be a balance.  The market is artificial and there are rules and laws surrounding its operation.  The corporations have too much of a free hand.<\/p> <p>  The mushroom growers made a request that the Government pay, as soon as possible, producer organisation the funding that is due to commercial mushroom producers for their 2015 programme.  They could not enlighten us as to why there was a delay in the payment.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might consider a scheme which is not on his books.  The mushroom growers explained to us that, from their height in 1996 of 600 growers, they are down to 60, having lost three businesses and 130 jobs recently.  This is the fallout from Brexit.  In many parts of the country there are empty polytunnels.  The steel structures and concrete bases are there.  Could the Minister come up with some scheme to support horticulture whereby we could grow produce more locally and supply it to local markets?  The Minister could present it as an environmentally-friendly scheme which would reduce the carbon footprint associated with importing certain produce we cannot grow in the natural environment.<\/p><p>There should be some scheme for alternative crops because these empty polytunnels are eyesores.

However, that is contingent on the budgetary process.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill and Senator Michelle Mulherin raised the issue of the horticulture sector.  I am cognisant of the difficulty it is experiencing.  There has been a swing, year on year, in the sterling exchange rate to our disadvantage.  It is 20% lower today than it would have been this time last year.  That is a significant blow for those in the sector dependent on the UK market.  I am acutely aware of the number of people who have lost their jobs and the plants which have closed while others are in crisis.  This is exercising not just the minds in my Department, but across the Government, because it ties into the whole Brexit difficulties with which we are grappling.  I am on the record saying that there is no upside for the agrifood sector and very few upsides for the Irish economy generally, given our, some would say, excessive trade dependency on UK markets.  Deputy Jackie Cahill referred to how this is also affecting the beef sector.<\/p> <p>  It is not that we are doing nothing, however.  For example, we paid out &euro;4.3 million in commercial horticulture grants in 2016.  Departmental funding is available for those interested in establishing local horticultural enterprises and refocusing from mushroom production.  Through CEDRA, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, we fund market opportunities.  One way to tackle the power of the multiples is to have other outlets.  Local markets are important in that regard.  However, they are not the be-all and end-all.  The commercial focus of the horticulture sector, the mushroom sector in particular, is export-oriented.  It is grappling with difficulties for which we are trying to put a package together.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the payment to the producer organisations, I do not want to get into a big debate on this because the Department is being sued by them.  However, for paying out, accounts need to be submitted.  Accounts have only been submitted in recent weeks for the relevant year.  There are other obligations as well not just in respect of accounts, but environmental actions, which must be taken before we can verify them.  It is our intention to pay as quickly when we have all of that material.  It is important to reiterate that the accounts were only submitted in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  Over 4,000 applicants have been approved under TAMS, targeted agricultural modernisation schemes.<\/p><p>We were behind the curve and much effort went into getting our systems ready for payment.

In fact, only over 100 applicants have submitted online applications for payment and only 4,000 approvals have issued.  One of the difficulties my Department faces is that it has funding approved for the drawdown of TAMS in 2016 but we would like to pay it.  We would encourage farmers to apply.<\/p><p> There are two critical documents farmers must have for payment in this scheme.  First, they will have to have completed a farm safety course.  Second, they have to have a tax clearance certificate.  Then there are basic matters such as signing forms.  The system is up and running ready for payments but we have not been overwhelmed.

However, only 100 applications have come in.<\/p> <p>  Some people have been approved.  While I acknowledge there have been difficulties in all sectors, many farmers, rightly and understandably, have decided that once they have an approval, they will hold on to that because they do not have the cash flow to manage repayments.  It raises the question as to how we might better track approvals with work being carried out because in terms of financial management it is a challenge.<\/p> <p>  On ANC, areas of natural constraint scheme, payments, there is a provision in the programme for Government for &euro;25 million but that is a 2018 payment.  The &euro;25 million this year is a sheep payment.  I know there is ground to be made up in terms of cuts made in disadvantaged payments in recent and not-so recent years.  Deputy Jackie Cahill will have to acknowledge we all have to share the blame for that.  There is a programme to undo that but it will be in 2018.<\/p> <p>  To an extent, there is some Brexit fatigue setting in, particularly about the uncertainty around it and how we will deal with it.  The Department has been extremely active in this area.  We have established a dedicated unit in the Department, along with a stakeholders&rsquo; forum to include agrifood, seafood and the fishing industry representatives to allow them articulate their specific concerns.  I have met with my Northern Ireland counterpart on three occasions and I will meet with my UK counterpart, Andrea Leadsom, in October.  In October, I will also meet the UK multiples which are significant purchasers of Irish agricultural product, totalling &euro;5.1 billion in exports.  Although Britain is leaving the European Union, we are not surrendering any shelf space.  We do not know the terms under which it will depart.  However, we are anxious to protect the markets we have.  We believe we have a good case to make in working with the UK because it has a reciprocal trade arrangement with us, exporting &euro;3.8 billion in agrifood services to here.  We believe we can make friends there.<\/p> <p>  We are also working on the other side in creating the political awareness across Europe.  The Taoiseach has met the new UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, the French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to create the political awareness of our specific dependency.  Due to this high level of dependency, the quest for other markets is a continuous challenge.  Live exports are obviously an important safety valve.  What the Department can do in that regard is open the markets.  We have succeeded in opening the live export market to Turkey.<\/p><p>We hope that significant numbers of lighter cattle would begin to move, which would put some floor on the weanling trade for the back end of this year.<\/p><p> As well as that, we are looking at other market opportunities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I visited China, Vietnam, Singapore and South Korea along with about 30 agrifood and seafood companies looking for new export opportunities.  Obviously, the big prize in this regard is opening the Chinese market for beef.  We have cleared one hurdle in respect of the Chinese Government lifting the BSE ban but we must progress other issues, and I had a series of meetings about that.  We continue to look intensively for new markets.  Bord Bia is a significant player and is extremely active in this regard.  It opened a new office in Singapore recently because south-east Asia is identified in Food Wise 2025 as a powerful emerging market with significant potential for us.<\/p><p> I will give the committee an example of how significant it could be.  Retail food sales in China, such as those in supermarkets, were &euro;750 billion in 2015.  It is projected that growth will reach &euro;1 trillion by 2020.  Exports to China, which has very quickly become our second biggest export destination, are worth about &euro;640 million.  It is our second biggest export destination for dairy and pork products.  We are a very significant exporter of infant formula to three or four very significant players in the market and we are the world's leading manufacturer of infant formula.  There is a significant growth opportunity in the market with the lifting of the one-child policy in China.  We are always out there looking for new market opportunities.<\/p><p> In fairness to Bord Bia, I would say that it has been a trailblazer in this regard, and I acknowledge the role of Mr. Aidan Cotter and his staff, who are small in number.  We work through the embassy network, and Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland work together because if we do not pool our resources, we will not have as big a punch.  From what I saw in south-east Asia, it is a very slick and interconnected operation between the diplomatic offensive that is necessary, the sales offensive that is necessary and the technical stuff, which people in my Department do all the time.  In that context, if members wanted to get a handle on that, I am sure my Department officials would be very willing to come in and give them an overview, which they did in the beef forum and other fora, regarding what they do about market access.  It is a phenomenally active sector in the Department and we work continuously at it.<\/p><p> We open markets and it is then up to the trade to step into the breach.  We succeeded in opening the US market for beef for grinding.  When I arrived in the Department on 6 May, the meat industry was continually knocking on the door about that issue.  The market has been opened, the industry must do its bit and we hope it will avail of some of those opportunities.<\/p><p> In respect of the boats-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#HH00500","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I was not criticising Bord Bia at all.

The truth is that the UK could decide at that stage to conclude the Mercosur trade deal and that would be damaging to us.  This is why that collaborative effort is critical.  I hasten to add that the UK is our closest market and the most valuable market for us to be in and we are not surrendering any shelf space there.  We are preparing contingency plans and the Department has been extremely active.  The Department has fed into a whole-of-Government approach to the matter.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of the farmer in the supply chain.  This issue has a lot of currency at EU level and domestically.  We await Commissioner Hogan's paper in this regard.  In April or May of this year, we introduced some regulations under the groceries order to bring greater certainty for suppliers to the multiples in terms of getting a written contract and abolishing the concept of so-called hello money.  We need to remain vigilant about the effectiveness of those regulations.  There are conflicting voices at European level.  Some want an overarching legal framework in the EU.  We would certainly like that because we export 90% of what we produce.<\/p><p>However, other countries, particularly those whose focus is primarily on a domestic market, see this as a domestic competence.  A point I made at the Commission was that this has been around for so long that the real challenge for us is whether we can get it off the table once and for all and avoid the kind of <i>ad hoc<\/i>approach that is the hallmark of the income crisis at the moment where, for example, those in the dairy industry jump up and down for six months and we get a package.  Is having some kind of shared regime whereby everybody contributes to a fund which automatically becomes available to the primary producer when the price of a commodity dips below the cost of production a better way to proceed?  That is something that will be the hallmark of success or failure of Commissioner Hogan's endeavours in this regard.  As a nation that exports 90% of its produce, there is a limited amount we can do.<br\/><br\/>I am meeting stakeholders in the grain sector on 6 October.  I have met and discussed this informally with farm organisations up to now and have also discussed it with individual farmers.  I was in the north west yesterday and met representatives of farm organisations there.  I appreciate the grain and fodder crisis and this is an issue we can discuss in that context.  It is a very challenging issue because while we are probably in the fourth year of a difficult harvest, it probably coincides with the second if not the third year of bumper global harvests which are driving global prices down.  If one compounds these lower prices with bad weather, difficulty in baling straw, high moisture content and sprouting, it is a very difficult issue.  I want to meet the sector and listen to its solutions rather than be prescriptive.  This meeting will take place on 6 October.  I appreciate that it is a very difficult space at the moment.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy Cahill, it is worth noting that 35% of appeals are successful.  Farmers should be made more aware of this figure.  Deputy Penrose will be interested to know that the Ombudsman has complimented the independent appeals office on how it operates as an effective agent for farmers.  A total of 35% of appeals are successful so it is worth exploring those options.  I think I have covered most of the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#JJ00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Did the Minister address the areas of natural constraint, ANC, issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>To date, we have paid &euro;140 million to 65,000 farmers.

They will be in a dire situation.  Some have taken conacre and many bills are falling due.  There have been a number of requests, including at European Parliament level, for a special crisis fund along the lines of the flood crisis fund that was put in place last year for people who had crop and property damage.

The scheme is enormously beneficial in terms, literally, of the knowledge it transfers, but it has an equivalent value in respect of the socialisation opportunity it brings to a profession that is largely carried on in isolation.  I have heard the concerns around the edges of the scheme.  Obviously, there is a facility within the mid-term review of the rural development programme to look at those issues.  At the moment, it is doing a very worthwhile job as evidenced by the number of participants, some of whom I have engaged with myself.  I appreciate what it achieves.<\/p> <p>  A number of members have raised the issue of the grain sector, including Senator Lombard and Deputy McConalogue.  I am meeting grain farmers on 6 October.  There are very difficult issues to grapple with.  It is a capital intensive business that cannot be sustained by the types of income that are being generated.  The business is structured unusually in Ireland in so far as a lot of the produce is grown on rented land.  We need to have a no-holds barred conversation around the solutions for farmers on a case-by-case basis.  Farmers need to look at the economics of it.  There is a limited amount that the State can do, just as there is a limited amount the State can do in respect of a crisis in any income sector.  However, this is something that has been extremely difficult for a number of years and it is now reaching a tipping point.  I want to go into it with an open mind and, respectfully, listen to the industry.  There are alternative crops that could be looked at.  I have spoken to my Cabinet colleague, Deputy Naughten, about energy crops.  I acknowledge that we did not have a great experience in that space with miscathus.  An effort was also made in respect of the Edenderry power plant to look at what could be grown there but that did not get off the ground.  The current situation is not sustainable and if we all come to the table to explore all of the options, including ones that might involve other Departments and agencies, we might come up with solutions for some.  It is very difficult and I appreciate that it is particularly so on the western seaboard.  <\/p> <p>  I was in Donegal yesterday and I met with the IFA.<\/p><p>I appreciate the point that Deputy Kenny made about bad weather in the north west.  The chairman of the County Leitrim IFA was part of that deputation and he cited chapter and verse on rainfall in the county from the meteorological service.  In June, July and August it was pretty wet, which poses problems, particularly on heavier ground.  The Department has had previous experience of fodder crises.  It is true to say, however, that there is not a fodder crisis in the country as a whole.  We have enough fodder but it is in the wrong places at the moment.  I appreciate that cattle have been in for a number of weeks in certain places.  Farmers will need to get appropriate advice on how to utilise scarce fodder resources.  The farm advisory services are there to assist them in this regard, but my Department has a track record in dealing with such issues and we will be keeping the situation under observation while working with farmers.<br\/><br\/>Senator Paul Daly<b><\/b>mentioned the diesel issue and I have seen all the speculation about that.  Together with my departmental officials, I have regular engagements with my colleagues, including the Minister for Finance who deals with excise duties.  We have been in contact on this issue.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman referred to the basic payment.  This time last year, I was sitting on the committee members' side of the table and I appreciate the issues involved.  I have discussed them with my colleagues in the Department.  Some are due to teething difficulties in a new system that was introduced last year.  There was an issue in prosecuting cases whereby if a person rang up more than once, he or she was talking to different people on successive days, so it was difficult.  I am assured we have a better system in place now.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy Penrose's question, we are constrained by EU regulations as to when we can pay.  The earliest date on which we can pay is 16 October.  It is because of that constraint that we will pay 75% on 17 October.  That is the maximum amount we can issue and it is the earliest date on which we can do so.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the income crisis and aquaculture licences.  We are making some progress.  In 2015, there were 104 licence determinations, while there are 150 this year, so we are playing catch-up.  I appreciate, however, that the licensing system is very cumbersome.  It is fraught with difficulties and the narrative is skewed against the industry and against licence applications.  We need to work collectively at improving the narrative in order that this industry can comfortably co-exist with tourism and angling interests, provided the industry is properly policed and monitored.  We need to do more, given the enormous potential, but we are catching up on the backlog.<br\/><br\/>Part of the solution to the income crisis is diversifying markets when one is in difficulty in one market.  I have dealt with that aspect.  We have received numerous submissions from farm organisations on income averaging and variations of that theme to allow farmers to shelter some of their income in a good year in order that it is available to them to draw down in a bad year.  We have received submissions on that from various farm organisations, including the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS.  We are exploring those options as well.<br\/><br\/>We also fund facilitators for producer organisations, which is something that could work in the beef sector.  A single farmer delivering a load of cattle to ABP or any other plant for that matter is a price taker.  However, if a producer organisation is dealing for 100 or 500 farmers, it may be operating to a contract.  It may say it can supply black white head heifers, 400 kg, on 1 August, 1 September, 1 October and 1 November in the numbers required, but it will only have a contract if it can get a guaranteed price.  That gives a farmer muscle in the marketplace which he has been missing to date.<\/p><p>Funding of those kinds of producer organisations is an innovation under the rural development programme, which might address some of the issues.  It is not a panacea and I appreciate that the markets are generally difficult anyway.  However, it will go some way towards addressing the imbalance which Senator Mulherin referred to earlier.  There are primary producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The people who get the worst of both worlds are primary producers and consumers.  If we got everyone along that chain to take a little bit of the pain, we could ensure primary producers had a reasonable standard of living.  None of the others will make a living if we do not have the primary producer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#MM00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>What about the slurry issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#OO00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of this.

I thank the Minister for addressing it.<\/p> <p>  Some serious questions need to be answered on the procedures that were used for the unprecedented reappointment of the chief executive of a semi-State for a second time.  The Minister's opening remarks did not address those issues.  In reply to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Calleary, last July, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, indicated that he had granted sanction for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland, Mr. Brian Kavanagh, to be appointed for a third time on the basis of a business case which had been put forward by the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  Specifically, the reply to the parliamentary question indicated that a business case had been put forward by the board of Horse Racing Ireland and had been endorsed and supported by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.<\/p> <p>  When the chairperson of Horse Racing Ireland contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, did he contact the Minister and indicate that he was acting with the authority of the board of Horse Racing Ireland or did he indicate that he was merely acting as chairperson of Horse Racing Ireland because that is an important distinction?  The Act states that the appointment of the chief executive officer is a matter for the board of Horse Racing Ireland, subject to the consent of the relevant Ministers.  If the Departments of the Ministers, Deputies Creed and Donohoe, merely received a request from the chairperson of the board of Horse Racing Ireland, but not indicating that the board had discussed the matter and had made the request, it would have been remiss of the Minister, Deputy Creed's Department to grant that without first clarifying that the board had discussed it and requested it and it was not simply the chairperson making the request.<\/p><p>Given what is in the legislation, I would have thought that would have been a matter of protocol for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Can the Minister clarify what was the nature of the request and how that approach was made?  That is particularly important.<\/p><p> In my view, this breaks down into two issues.  First, there is the issue of the reappointment for the first time of a semi-State CEO for a third period in breach of Government guidelines.  I ask the Minister to elaborate further on why this unprecedented step was necessary.<\/p><p> The second part is whether proper procedure was followed in how the request was made, how it was dealt with by Government and how it was dealt with by the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  It has been agreed that it was not dealt with by the board of Horse Racing Ireland and that raises significant governance questions.  It behoves the Minister to explore that further and ensure that there is proper examination in the context of making sure that when semi-State body CEOs are being appointed, proper procedure is followed at all times.  I would like answers from the Minister to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#QQ00400","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>A number of issues need to be dealt with here.

From where did it come and who set out the business case?  Was it the board or was it simply the chairperson, because there is some concern that the business case was not something that was put forward by the board of Horse Racing Ireland and, indeed, if it exists at all, that it is a very slim document?  We must to get to the nub of these issues.  Ultimately, my question is whether the Minister was misled by persons in Horse Racing Ireland in regard to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#RR00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>There are a couple of matters.  While I appreciate that the Minister is here, it is unfortunate that he was not here before two days ago when Mr. Brian Kavanagh started his third term.  Questions have been raised on this matter previously and we want to know what action the Minister took in accordance with his statutory responsibility under the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 to seek information from the board with regard to these matters.<\/p> <p>  A number of Deputies across parties have written to the Minister directly, written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, or tabled questions.  To be honest, the information we have got has been completely contradictory and the Minister has not answered any of the points tonight.<\/p> <p>  I want to know if the Minister engaged in discussions since being made aware that the so-called business case upon which he told us he supported the decision to reappoint Mr. Kavanagh for a third period came from the board.  The Minister was alerted months ago that such was not the case.  What steps did the Minister take since being informed that the business case did not come from the board in order to make contact with various board members on the matter?  We know that board members did not have sight of it.<\/p> <p>  The fact that the board subsequently ratified the appointment does not really overcome many of those points in terms of the contradiction.  If one looks at it, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in reply to a parliamentary question that is a matter of public record, stated on 13 July that the appointment had been made by the board but was strongly supported by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I would like to know if the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is wrong on that because on the same day the Minister, Deputy Creed, was answering another letter stating that the matter was currently under consideration.  I would like to know if the Minister, Deputy Creed, had seen the business case in July.  What date was that submitted to the Minister?  Was it submitted to him by the chairman or by the CEO?<\/p><p>Were the names of the board members on that business case and, if not, did that not strike the Minister as odd?  Did the Minister seek clarification from the board that it had sanctioned the business case submitted?  The Minister is telling members it is the responsibility of the board - it is - but it is subject to his consent and that of his colleague.  Frankly, diametrically-opposed statements were issued on the same day as to what was going on.  The Minister should also deal with an issue I find to be rather strange.  He told me earlier that he would look into the matter and that it was under consideration.  At the same time, however, the Department's website shows a briefing document was prepared by the Minister's officials in May stating he already had sought the permission of the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to extend the contract by five years.  This document has been on the website since May, but yet in September the Minister wrote to state that it was under consideration.<\/p><p> Many things do not add up here and while I do not wish to hog the issue, it is also of concern that this is the first reappointment of a person for an unprecedented third term.  It is a little scary because while it may be stated - I have heard this - that the individual has great expertise, is almost in a unique position and nobody on the planet has the expertise to replace him, there are two problems with that.  First, that is the type of argument put forward to support the Olympic Council of Ireland's ratification of the same person in a position for decades unchallenged.  If one is dealing with a board, Government guidelines on appointments stating someone should not serve more than seven years are in place for a reason; it generally is not healthy.  A second extension was given on the basis of an open advertisement, which allowed for some transparency but to give a third one without doing that simply is bizarre because it is not healthy.  Every organisation needs fresh blood and the Minister should deal with the fact that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine raised concerns about Mr. Kavanagh's pay and about how he is in substantial breach of the salary cap for such positions while staff members in Horse Racing Ireland have had their salaries cut.  Was this raised with the board or the chairman when they came to the Minister on these matters?  While I am under some pressure of time, the Minister probably will need to come back before the committee because there is a lot of stuff there with regard to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#RR00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I raised this issue with the Minister by way of parliamentary question.  While I believe it was referred on the same day as Deputy Calleary raised his, the replies did not tally by any stretch.  Moreover, I was aware that they did not tally and was surprised by the reply.  I am familiar with the way parliamentary questions work and it was to the effect that nothing would happen until nearly September and the matter was under consideration.  However, the hen had flown the nest at that stage and consequently, I was not informed correctly as to what was happening.  I was somewhat disappointed by that because as the Minister is aware, I have a significant interest in the horse racing industry, probably as great as anyone present, and I spent a lot of time dealing with that Bill.  I have a view of how this all happened but I will not express it in public.  When the contract was put in place in 2001, it was for seven years.  The guidelines have been in operation since 1999, although they have been upgraded and refurbished since then with the end-of-years service.  However, when the seven-year period was up, the position at least was advertised and that was allowed for by the guidelines.  In 2014, did the chairman write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine seeking an extension of three years?  When it was announced, from where did the five years come?<\/p> <p>  My view is the Minister apparently gave a consent based on a business plan.  Who prepared this famous business plan?  Was it the case that the board never saw this business plan prior to the Minister giving his consent?  After the Minister gave his consent, it was necessary for the decision to go back to the board.  However, as the Minister is giving &euro;60 million on behalf of the taxpayers, would the board not appear very ungrateful if its members started to kick up a row in that context?  The cart was in place before the horse in this regard.  The first hop of the ball is the board should have discussed the business plan in its totality and then made its pitch.<\/p><p>The Minister then would have been obliged to note that this was a third application and that at a minimum, it would be necessary to advertise or do something in this regard.  Everyone is saying no one else could do the job and the outgoing chief executive officer undoubtedly had tremendous expertise and so on.  However, nobody would let anybody go if that was the case, because I am sure all chief executive officers have many attributes and much acumen acquired over the years.<\/p><p> The development at the Curragh, with all this money brought in from outside, does not say much.  A lot of it was brought in on foot of work by the Turf Club and it does not all reside in the great person who is involved.  That would be to mislead everybody because many people were involved in that regard.  While it is easy to develop the big courses, the same people used to irritate me when they nearly put the small ones out of business.  Part of the problem I have with the whole lot of them is that this is still their view.  It is always the three or four big courses about which many of those people are concerned, not the small ones for which members were obliged to fight hard here.  Thereafter, even when the battle had been won, little wasps or stingers are still being sent across to the unfortunate small courses seeking more money.  I will state straight out to the Minister what my problem is with Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  It has received &euro;60 million or more over the years, yet it always came looking to the bloody unfortunate people who owned or had a few old horses in training or people like that.  It was always looking for something like that and I have expressed my annoyance at that behaviour.<\/p><p> Perhaps I am a bit stupid - I probably am - but there is something I cannot understand.  There was a board meeting today and as far as I am aware, some people still had not seen the business plan.  Perhaps they saw it today or they may have seen a summary of it.  This is what I think happened: the Minister gave his consent and appears to have advised the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to give his consent.  That is the sequence of events and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has stated it was necessary for the Minister to give an advice.  The only way in which the Minister could have given an advice was based upon a board decision.  The Minister could not do it unless there had been a board decision.  In accordance with the Act the Minister has quoted, there must be a board decision and it cannot be just one person.<\/p><p> On a related topic, as the Minister has only been in office for three or four months I will give him a pardon but why has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine refused to carry out a value-for-money audit on HRI?  It was one of the recommendation of the Indecon report that I debated here until I got sick to the teeth of it.  As that was two years ago, why has that not been carried out?  We are paying &euro;59 million; let us see such an audit.  This matter should also be addressed because that has not been carried out.  A number of issues arise in this regard and I believe that whatever happened in 2011 had consequential knock-on effects for this appointment now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016092700002#SS00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I await the Minister's answers.

One cannot open a newspaper or turn on a radio without encountering this story, which is in the top three headlines.  The entire integrity and reputation of the Irish racing and thoroughbred industry is in an almost irreparable position at present.  How will that be turned around?  It is a serious industry that has been dragged through the gutters in recent days.  Moreover, this state of affairs has been brought onto the industry by its governing body, which is supposed to be promoting the Irish horse.  The eyes of the world will be on the<i><\/i>Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on Sunday and although one should be hoping for an Irish victory and the promotion of the Irish horse, instead there is negativity.<\/p><p>That negativity would be seen in a parade ring in a racecourse, in a bookie's shop or on the street because of this.

It issued a press statement afterwards stating that it met today to review matters concerning the reappointment of its chief executive, Brian Kavanagh, and elements of the commentary and misunderstandings which have followed.  The board expressed regret that this matter has become the subject of public concern.  The board refutes suggestions that the chairman intentionally misled the relevant Departments with regard to the chief executive officer, CEO, appointment process.  Dating back to 2011, the then board mandated the then HRI chairman to advance outstanding matters regarding the resolution of the CEO&rsquo;s contract and any related matters.  The issue was transferred to the new chairman, Mr. Joe Keeling, on his succession to office in March 2013.  The board confirmed that the chairman&rsquo;s actions and intentions reflected its views regarding the CEO&rsquo;s contract.  It also recognised that a more collegiate approach would have improved the process but its members were fully agreed that there was no intention to inform the Minister incorrectly or that the board&rsquo;s views had been misrepresented.  The board, having endorsed Mr. Kavanagh&rsquo;s appointment previously, confirmed today that it is satisfied that the best result for HRI and the industry has been achieved with the successful completion of the new CEO contract.<\/p><p>Many of the issues raised today are appropriate and germane to HRI, the chairman, the board and the CEO.  In so far as I have a role in this, it is prescribed clearly by law.  Under section 21(3) of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act 1994, &ldquo;The chief executive shall hold office on and subject to such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to remuneration) as may be approved of by the Authority with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  The board was under no obligation by virtue of the consent that was given.<\/p><p>When the Department receives a communication from the chairman of a State authority, it is reasonable to assume that the chairman speaks on behalf of the board.  That is a legitimate assumption.  We received a communication looking for the reappointment of Mr. Kavanagh as a business case.  The case presented in a letter outlined several issues deemed to be critical.  They are issues on which the board says today its views and the views of the chairman were <i>ad idem<\/i>.  They shared the same objective.

As the Chairman will be aware, this is the first time that I have participated in the committee's proceedings since it was formed with new members and a new Chairman following this year's D&aacute;il and Seanad elections.  I look forward to continuing my regular and positive engagement with the committee in our collective task of supporting and assisting the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to see a number of colleagues from their respective constituencies in Northern Ireland and I thank them for their attendance.  They are welcome.  They make an important and valued contribution to this committee and I look forward to their observations and questions on issues.<\/p> <p>  I will commence by addressing the UK referendum decision and the Government's view on its implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  The result sent a political shock across Europe and beyond and registered in both parts of this island in particular and fundamental ways.  The Government's four headline concerns are known: Northern Ireland and the peace process; the Border and common travel area; the economy and trade; and the importance and future of the EU.  Since the day of the result, the Government has implemented its published contingency plan.  As part of that, I carried out a round of contacts over the summer with all of my 27 EU counterparts to outline the unique circumstances that exist on the island of Ireland and the major concerns of the Irish Government.  The Taoiseach met Prime Minister May, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Tusk and other Heads of Government in Europe in order to do the same.  The Government's intensive engagement with our EU partners, including the UK Government, continues and we are further deepening the analysis and preparations across the whole of Government for the eventual UK-EU negotiation process, which we expect will commence in the spring of next year.<\/p><p>As part of this, I have already met the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, and, of course, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  In Northern Ireland, a majority voted to remain and this wish was particularly pronounced among the nationalist community, although not by any means exclusively so.  Many people across both communities are now understandably concerned that leaving the European Union would have implications for political stability, the ongoing process of reconciliation and prosperity.<\/p><p> In addressing this concern since the result of the referendum, the Government has clearly and consistently emphasised that the Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement that remains in force regardless of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and that the Good Friday Agreement remains the basis for engagement by both governments in Northern Ireland.  This was confirmed by the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister May at their first discussion on the issue on 13 July and their first meeting in Downing Street on 26 July.  The continued political commitment to the Good Friday Agreement by both Governments, the Executive, other parties in the North and by virtually all quarters of society across these islands provides a very important source of stability and consensus at this challenging time.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and succeeding agreements, the Government is determined that its institutions, values and principles be fully protected throughout and at the end of the UK's negotiation of its new relationship with the European Union.<\/p><p> It is vital the agreement in all its dimensions can be relied upon by people and our political systems throughout the uncertainties and challenges that are undoubtedly presented by the proposed exit of the UK from the European Union.  The work of this committee, in supporting the full and continuing implementation of the agreement, therefore has an added fundamental importance as we deal with the full range of issues covered in the agreement, from provisions and consent in constitutional status to human rights protection, parity of esteem and identity to the institutions reflecting the totality of relationships on this island and between Britain and Ireland.  Doing that will clearly require effective North-South and east-west co-operation, and the institutions of the agreement have already proven their value and indispensability in this regard.<\/p><p> The North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting was hosted by the Taoiseach in Dublin on 4 July and I was present, together with my Government colleagues, the First and Deputy First Minister and all the Executive Ministers.  At this meeting, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to work closely to ensure Northern Ireland's interests are protected and advanced and that the benefits of North-South co-operation are protected in any new arrangements emerging as regards the future of the UK and its relationship with the European Union.  It was also agreed that a full audit would be undertaken across all sectors of co-operation to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising in the phases preceding and following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  This work commenced immediately and is progressing across all the North-South co-operation sectors.  A number of the serious implications raised by Brexit are fundamentally cross-Border in nature and these were highlighted and agreed by the Government and the Executive at that North-South Ministerial Council plenary session in July.  Protecting European Union funding, sustaining the economy and trade and maintaining the Common Travel Area are priority areas where we agreed a need to work closely.<\/p><p> We must be clear that there are no silver bullets for any of these issues and they will only be effectively dealt with through concerted North-South co-operation in addition to the wider strategic engagement by the Government with all 27 EU partners, with the Executive working closely with the UK Government.  The next North-South Ministerial Council plenary session is scheduled for 18 November and that will provide an important opportunity to build on the discussions between Ministers with the North-South sectors and explore further the agreed key priorities for both the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive in dealing with the UK's exit from the Union.<\/p><p> I look forward to the continued positive, practical and effective work of the council in helping both administrations, North and South, to deal with these issues as raised by Brexit.  This will be an ongoing dialogue between our two administrations for some time to come.  This is in addition, of course, to the important standing work of the council, which is ongoing.  The British-Irish Council has also taken on an added significance as a forum for addressing the implications of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Both the Taoiseach and I participated in the extraordinary summit of the council in Cardiff on 22 July that was convened to consider the outcome of the UK referendum.<\/p><p>There was consensus among the eight members on the importance of the council as an institution of the Good Friday Agreement and as a forum to share views and to enhance co-operation at this challenging time.  The next summit meeting of the British-Irish Council will be in November.  The Good Friday Agreement affords us institutions, principles and procedures that will prove invaluable in managing the complex process of the UK exit from the European Union in a way which preserves and sustains the enormous level of progress made on this island in recent times.  However, as the committee is well aware, there remain a number of important elements of the Good Friday Agreement which still have not been implemented.  These include the Irish Language Act, the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and the North-South consultative forum.  Full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the successor agreements is a priority for me, as Minister, and for the Government, as it has been for previous Governments.  We will continue to work with all parties to seek progress on the implementation of the outstanding provisions.  The prospect of the UK's exit from the European Union gives an added reason to implement all provisions of the agreement fully in order that its full balance and integrity protects and sustains the peace process into the period ahead.<\/p><p> With the permission of the Chairman, I wish to add a final point on the implementation of the Stormont House and Fresh Start agreements.  As the committee will be aware, these two agreements, in 2014 and 2015, together address a range of issues that were hampering and, indeed, threatening the continued operation of the political institutions in Belfast.  Although we are not yet there, I have to acknowledge that there has been sustained and significant progress with the implementation of each of these agreements since they were concluded.  This has been driven by the political commitment and a determination on all sides and overseen in the quarterly review meetings by the two Governments and the parties to the Executive.  Like the Good Friday Agreement, anything short of full implementation will leave important issues still effectively unaddressed.<\/p><p> The major outstanding area from the Stormont House agreement is dealing with the legacy of the past.  This is a critical agenda for Northern Ireland in order that the needs of victims and survivors of the Troubles can be fully met and deeper reconciliation in society can be fostered with positive and active participation of the political, police and judicial systems.  Despite extensive effort, it did not prove possible to agree the establishment of the Stormont House legacy institutions in the talks that led to the Fresh Start agreement in November.  Since then Government has undertaken extensive consultations with a range of victims groups, civil society representatives and the political parties.  The British Government has also undertaken a range of meetings, including by the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland following his appointment in July.<\/p><p> Given the importance of addressing the legacy of the past to our goal of genuine healing and reconciliation, I emphasise to this committee the continued strong commitment of the Government to getting the legacy institutions established as soon as possible.  I discussed the legacy issues in detail with the Secretary of State at our bilateral meeting in Dublin two weeks ago.  While I acknowledge that there are still outstanding issues to be resolved, I agreed with the Secretary of State that concerted efforts should be made to find a way forward in the period ahead.  Dealing with the legacy of the past is essential to allow politics and society to focus on the challenges of today and to bring whatever truth and healing is possible to individual victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and throughout the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.  I thank the committee for its time and engagement and look forward to dealing with its queries and listening to its observations, advice and guidance regarding the matter of the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#B00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and now invite questions from those who indicate.

If it is not going to be on the Border, can it be at an entry point to Britain?  Will control be in place at an entry point such as Heathrow Airport, Stranraer or Holyhead, or will it be at an entry point into the Irish Republic?

Like my colleague, I compliment him and the Government on their efforts to ensure Ireland is as prepared as it possibly can be for the inevitable exit of the UK from the EU.  Like my colleague, Dr. McDonnell, I have a concern about Border issues.  The day after the referendum, I was one of the first people to mention the possibility of a hard Border.  We have had reassurances from the Minister, the Taoiseach and senior British politicians that there is no desire to return to any type of Border.  However, whether it is a hard or soft Border, the implementation of any kind of control on the Border will set back the peace process and will have disastrous implications for free movement on this island.  It would also have the potential to turn Belfast into an Ellis Island.  The Brexit referendum was driven largely by racial or immigration concerns, primarily on the UK mainland and not so much in Northern Ireland.  I have concerns there.  What reassurances have we had from European leaders from the other 27 countries that they will not try to enforce a border on the country?<\/p> <p>  There will be a need for Britain to repeal EU legislation that has been enacted over the years.  There has been some talk about anti-discrimination and workers' rights legislation.  What reassurance have we that the British Government will try as hard as possible to ensure any new legislation it introduces, as Brexit unfolds, will be as closely aligned as possible with European law?<\/p> <p>  A significant amount of funding comes to the Border area on both sides.  I cannot see the EU continuing to fund the peace process in the North, regardless of whether we have a soft or hard Border, while funding will come to the South.  We could find ourselves in a situation in which the North of Ireland would become significantly worse off.  I see this as a danger to the peace process.  I hope I have not thrown too much at the Minister.  I would appreciate his thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#E00500","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister and his officials.

Many people in the Border areas have an expectation around that matter and there is some question mark over it.  What is the Minister's perspective on it, particularly in light of the deadline on these projects coming in November <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Treasury?  Do we know the Treasury's position?

I acknowledge that the issues raised by Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, Deputy Sherlock and Senator Craughwell are perhaps the most important ones in this engagement.  We have not reached a conclusion on any of them because the negotiations have not yet commenced.  The issue raised by Dr. McDonnell on the hard border is one that has been raised on a number of occasions, not only in the context of my discussions with members of the UK Government and the leaders of political parties in the Northern Executive but also among my EU colleagues.  There has been a series of statements made by a number of UK Ministers directly involved that it is not their desire to see a return to the borders of the past.  I welcome that; it is essential.  I look around the table here and see long-standing Members of Parliament such as Deputy Brendan Smith, newer Members like Deputies Breathnach and McLoughlin and Mark Durkan, Francie Molloy, Pat Doherty and others who have worked - perhaps all of their adult lives - along the Border area.  They know the importance of ensuring that the Border remains invisible for a number of reasons, not least the fact that 30,000 people cross every day for various reasons and that it has been invisible for the past number of years.  This is a real concern and one that will continue to occupy a priority position in the negotiation.<\/p> <p>  I have acknowledged what UK Ministers have said and I have also acknowledged the Irish Government's position.  It is important to note that, ultimately, in the context of the negotiations, which have not yet commenced, this could be an issue decided not between the UK and Irish Governments but by the wider remaining membership of the European Union.  That is why I have met every one of my 26 EU counterparts.  I have raised this specific issue in the context of the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process which has, in the context of the past 50 years of its engagement, been a very positive project for the European Union.  I refer to the specific contribution of the former MEP John Hume many years ago in making his colleagues in the European Parliament and beyond aware of the need for a wider European engagement with the process.  That is widely acknowledged.<\/p><p>Not only was there a certain sympathy and knowledge on the part of my EU colleagues, but there was a certain understanding of the unique position on the island of Ireland and the inherent dangers to the peace process of any significant changes to the Border in terms of it becoming heavily fortified.  Members of the Oireachtas, Westminster and the Northern Assembly need to ensure this issue remains very much top of the agenda.  While statements on the part of the UK Government on this issue are welcome, I am not sure if they can be regarded as assurances.  We need to ensure that, by the end of these negotiations, in whatever time it takes, we will have appropriate assurances not only from the UK Government, but from our EU colleagues.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Sean Sherlock with me in the matter of the Stormont House Agreement and the Fresh Start agreement, as well as his engagement in North-South relations over the period in which he served as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He quite rightly raised the issue of funding in which he was involved.  It is important this issue remains on the agenda.  It was discussed at the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in July.  More recently, there was a sectorial meeting of the special EU programme body which took place in my office in Iveagh House.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, agreed to write jointly to the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Creu, on the issue.  This work is continuing.  Both Ministers have been in touch with each other and in contact with Europe.  It is important we see the letters of offer which have been issued to the applicants as soon as possible.  I note certain assurances given by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding other EU funding.  It is important we acknowledge these are pretty complex financial issues.  There are also technical legal issues involved.  It needs to be worked through.  However, I can do no more than to give the Chairman and committee members assurances that we will keep them fully informed of developments.  There is a commitment on the part of the Government that we can see through these issues towards a successful implementation of these programmes.<\/p><p> Issues were raised by committee members in the context of the referendum campaign.  However, we need to deal with issues now in the context of there being moves on the part of the UK Government towards withdrawal.  I acknowledge the statement from the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, in which he offered words of comfort and certain assurances over a range of EU-funded programmes in the UK.  Obviously, these assurances will only come into play when the UK withdraws from the EU and when that stream of funding is no longer available.<\/p><p> I agree there can be most serious consequences for the future of EU-funded cross-Border programmes.  What this would involve, how it will work through and its implications, are all issues which remain to be fully worked through and understood.  The committee can be assured they will form a priority on the part of our relations both in our ongoing discussions with UK Ministers and in the wider European Union.<\/p><p>We need to be committed, as I expect everyone is, to the maximum drawdown of funding here.  At this stage, I would not be in a position to make any assumptions until the negotiation process gets under way.<\/p><p> The issue of the repeal by the British Government of certain legislative provisions in the areas of workers' rights, human rights and advances, as I think it fair to describe them, that this jurisdiction and the UK have incorporated into our respective domestic laws over 40 years will be complex and challenging.  It is important that it is fully understood.  There were times during the referendum campaign when I felt that an appropriate level of debate, much less understanding, of the challenges ahead did not exist.  However, I assure the committee that the Government and I fully acknowledge the importance and superiority of the Good Friday Agreement in letter and spirit.  I have discussed this issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, MP.  I suspect that the members here have also done so at party leader level in recent weeks.  I acknowledge statements by Mr. Brokenshire and assurances he has given me that any appropriate change in legislation on the part of his colleagues in the British Government would be wholly consistent with the terms and conditions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome that but we need to ensure that this is the case by closely monitoring what will be a hugely challenging and legally complex process that could well take a number of years to work through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#F00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

He emphasised that the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will remain a priority for him and his Government colleagues, as it should be for all of us here in the Oireachtas.  An Irish language Act, a bill of rights, a civic forum and a North-South consultative forum are all issues that need to be addressed and progressed.  I sincerely hope that it will be possible to do the latter.<br\/><br\/>The Minister mentioned a number of us who have had the honour of representing our constituencies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for some time.  As a Member of this House in the 1990s, I spent a great deal of time dealing with issues relating to the Border.  They involved people being harassed, particularly at weekends.  Mr. Adrian O'Neill, a senior Department official who is here with the Minister, was the person on the Anglo-Irish desk at the time who I persecuted every Monday morning and Sunday night with regard to buses being delayed or people being harassed on the way home from football matches.  I never thought that we would be back talking about possible border controls in our own province of Ulster.  I never thought it would be possible.  Sadly, this may be the situation with which we may be confronted.  I hope that will not be the case.  Since the mid-1990s, all of us - North and South - have underestimated the fact that there has been huge economic development on a North-South and South-North basis.  People in this State and in Northern Ireland underestimate the movement of individuals on a daily basis going to and from work on either side of the Border.  I represent two rural counties - Cavan and Monaghan - in the south of Ulster.  There is a huge movement of people from the North to the South and <i>vice versa<\/i>on a daily basis, which is very welcome.  If there are restrictions on the movement of people or goods, it will be a nightmare that will prevent further economic development.  This would be a huge hindrance to people's daily business and to the further economic, social and political development of our island.<br\/><br\/>There are serious concerns along the Border regarding the possible impact of Brexit.  They have already arisen due to the uncertainty caused by the decision, particularly the drop in the value of sterling and the impact this has had on business.<\/p><p>Thankfully, there are many small and medium enterprises which have developed in recent years on our side of the Border which trade exclusively in the sterling area.  Likewise, there are firms on the Northern side which trade exclusively with us.  They will be impacted very heavily due to uncertainty on the value of sterling and currency fluctuations.  In one of the rooms next to this one, the mushroom sector is meeting the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The sector has already been badly hit due to the drop in the value of sterling.  This is impacting not just on that sector, but on other sectors also, and the impact has not been quantified as of yet.  Thankfully, many of our major enterprises in farming and the agrifood sectors have developed businesses on an all-Ireland basis.  Lakeland Dairies in my constituency was predominantly a Cavan, Monaghan and north midlands enterprise, but is now a huge enterprise North of the Border also.  It has manufacturing sites on both sides of the Border.  Likewise, LacPatrick, which was formerly the Town of Monaghan Co-Operative and Dairy Society, is a major agrifood company with sites on both sides of the Border.  We cannot imagine the difficulties that will arise for such enterprises because they move raw material North or South depending on the need at each plant.  On the idea of having restrictions, Dr. Alasdair McDonnell referred to the difficulties that would arise even from the so-called \"soft Border\".  It would impose additional expense on business and make us less competitive.  Any type of Border would be a huge hindrance to economic development in the Border region and the country as a whole.<\/p><p> There is a huge task ahead.  I welcome the fact that the Minister stated very clearly that he wants to work with the committee.  I mentioned at the last meeting of the committee the need to involve civic society to a great extent in the work of the political system and of the public service.  Some thought must be given to the establishment of an all-Ireland civic forum on Brexit because we need an all-island project to bring out the best in the political system, the public sector and civic society to ensure that we address in a meaningful way all of the major issues that face us as a result of the decision in the British referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Deputy Brendan Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his staff for attending today.

Currently, the North-South Ministerial Council is represented to the EU by both Governments.  What would be the role of the Irish Government in taking that forward if Britain were to leave the EU?

I hope this is a serious start to the dialogue on the myriad issues covered by the Good Friday Agreement with, as is clearly necessary, a particular emphasis on Brexit over the next period of time.  At the risk of being repetitive, I will cover the issue of funding, which has been alluded to by other members, to stress the importance of funding certainty for the peace and INTERREG programmes.  For community groups, local authorities or any of the myriad organisations which look to plan for funding, it is no good to have a stop-start situation.  Local authorities, for example, need to plan the spending of this money right up to 2021.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the British Exchequer gives an early commitment to supporting those programmes in order to allow for the necessary planning to bring those projects to a conclusion.<\/p><p> The second issue has already been referred to by Deputy Smith.  It is the question of ensuring that there is joined-up thinking and dialogue from both a North-South and an east-west perspective.  There was a symposium in the Mansion House last week, which was a great start, as is today's committee meeting, concerning the dialogue on related macro issues.  I am equally concerned about micro issues.  The Taoiseach has referred to the need for a conversation, including the farm gate and grocery store, given the impact that Brexit will have.  Large organisations may have the wherewithal to embrace the difficulties that Brexit has posed for us, but more important we must examine how individual community groups can express their concerns.

I do not represent a Border area but I do not see that as a disadvantage because there are vehicles such as this committee.  I keep in close contact with my Government colleagues from the Border area, including Deputy McLoughlin and Senator Feighan.  I welcome the experience and expertise that Deputy Smith has provided over many years, and which Deputy Breathnach has in more recent times.  I am anxious to hear their concerns.<\/p> <p>  I have been in Border areas and I am happy to continue that engagement both North and South.  This committee is a useful forum in which practical issues can be highlighted with a view to addressing them.  I welcome contact on all occasions from people on the northern side of the Border.  I acknowledge my positive working relationship with colleagues in the North during my period in office.  That should now be subject to a great level of intensification. <\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Smith that civil society should be engaged.  We should use the opportunity to harness the expertise and experience involved, having regard to the extent of the challenge.  There is a need for the widest possible engagement and conversation on the implications following the result of the UK referendum, both North and South.  Many individuals and groups across the island of Ireland are not engaged daily with the political establishment.  Deputy Smith is right to say that they should have an opportunity to have their voices heard and acted upon.  That is in everyone's interest.  In the coming weeks, the Government will put forward ideas on how best to harness this expertise and experience.  It is important to have the widest possible engagement and I am satisfied that that will take place before the end of this year.  I will be happy to hear the views of committee members in this respect, and will remain fully engaged with them.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to welcome Mr. Pat Doherty, MP.  The North-South Ministerial Council and the sectoral meetings will now take upon themselves a greater level of urgency.<\/p><p>I have been in contact with ministerial colleagues recently and North-South ministerial sectoral meetings involving a range of Departments, including those with responsibility for environment, aquaculture and marine, education, agriculture, trade and business and health and food safety, have been arranged for dates that include 26 October and 9 November.  We will hold a plenary session on 18 November.  The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, will meet on 2 December.  I spoke to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport today and said I am looking forward to having dates confirmed.  I would be happy to act as overall co-ordinator and have been in contact with colleagues in Armagh.  Members know of the level of commitment to and understanding of these issues on the part of our secretariat in Armagh.  It is important to continue to engage.<\/p><p> As the negotiations proceed, those forums can engage with our respective Governments.  I underline the commitment of my colleagues in government to the sectoral meetings and the overall engagement within the North-South Ministerial Council.  I urge members who are not here and do not take up their seats here of the importance of, and the real need for, their engagement also and that of their constituents and communities at sectoral level.<\/p><p> I certainly respect the 56% vote in Northern Ireland.  It creates a real challenge in the context of the overall negotiations that England, outside London, and Wales voted to leave but Scotland voted to remain.  My primary interest, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, is in the vote of the people of Northern Ireland.  I have impressed upon my UK colleagues and all of my European counterparts that the unique situation on the island of Ireland is such that 56% of people in the North cast their vote voted to remain within the EU.  However, the legal structures are such that we do not deal with Northern Ireland or Wales as members of the European Union but with the UK.  It is important, however, that, in the context of negotiations, that full consideration be given to the fact that people in Northern Ireland who had the opportunity to cast their vote and did so in the full knowledge of what was at stake voted to remain.  That feeds in to what I have been doing in pressing my EU colleagues and will continue to do so, not for any special pleading or case but that due regard be given to the unique circumstance on the island of Ireland where there will be an EU frontier across the island from east to west and all the consequences that flow from that, as outlined by everybody here.  We need to do some work together on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#K00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  It is very important that we hear at first hand about the different parts of the negotiations.  Living in a Border county, I know the difficulties of trade and people moving back and forth across it for work and other reasons and for businesses that are expanding, North and South.  We can view it purely in financial terms, which is very important, but we can also view it in human rights terms.  While British Ministers have said they want to ensure those rights are not taken away, some of the speeches before the referendum concentrated on the issues of human rights - and within these, workers' rights - and to reduce them in the context of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p> <p>  The members of the new communities coming into my area have fears about whether they can stay to work.<\/p><p>Businesses are also worried as to whether their workers will stay.

We must, given the fact that we have done away with borders, find a long-term solution to this which involves no borders.  This affects the farming community in particular.  The movement of people back and forth across the Border is one issue, but the movement of animals and livestock is also a difficulty.  The pig industry in Cookstown, for example, will be dramatically affected if livestock cannot move across the Border in the normal way.  The devaluation of sterling has had a big effect on that industry already.  These are the issues we must look at.

I am very concerned about the current situation.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly met Professor Michael Dougan, who is a professor of European Law at the University of Liverpool.  He argued that the four EU freedoms, namely, the free movement of people, goods, capital and services cannot be implemented in the context of what is happening in the UK.  The political establishment in the UK has gone missing.  This is like a car crash.  It is so serious in terms of its potential impact on peace on the island of Ireland.  The British Government is saying that it will be all right on the night.  Others are saying that the EU might put the boot in but there are things that the EU simply cannot do.  I ask that Professor Dougan be invited to speak to this committee to outline the serious consequences of Brexit.  British politicians have said that it will be all right on the night, that they can do this and that but this is extremely serious and if we do not address it, we will be in a very difficult position.<\/p> <p>  As others have rightly stated, people here were shocked at the referendum result, especially given that the majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.  I have three particular concerns.  First, we cannot have a border on the island of Ireland.  A border would be a rallying call for dissidents and would be unworkable.  The only place that we should see a border is in the Irish Sea, between the island of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I am stating a political fact here.  This is fact because there is no other way that can be implemented.  Second, we must think outside the box and as Deputy Brendan Smith rightly said, we need an all-Ireland forum.  We already have the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the North-South Interparliamentary Association, all of which are good in themselves.  However, what is happening at the European level is critical.  At present, there is an average of 26 meetings per day taking place in the EU and the members of Irish and British negotiating teams are working together but that will not continue.  We must look at other ways to unite the people of this country and the United Kingdom.  There are areas that we must explore - not necessarily the Commonwealth - in terms of strengthening those links.  There are strong business and diplomatic links between the UK and Ireland which must be strengthened.  We must find ways to support the Good Friday Agreement and to secure our country's future.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have a view on other aspects of maintaining political links?  How can we establish cultural, historical and economic links?  We need to talk about these matters now because nobody else is talking about them apart from us here on the island of Ireland.  We have been let down by the establishment and by the people who voted against as a protest vote.  They did not think about peace on the island of Ireland or of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#MM00300","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding what the Minister has said about engaging with all the foreign affairs Ministers in Europe, and I know the extent of the engagement North-South and with Britain, how confident is he that when the EU negotiates with Britain, Ireland will have a place at the negotiation table because of our unique position in terms of the North?  I am sure everyone will agree that the nitty gritty will be sorted out at the negotiations.  If Ireland is not at the negotiation table, we will be at a disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said he will come back to the legacy issues.

I want to make it clear that the Government remains fully committed to the successful implementation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  A lot of money is involved.  In fact, the Government is proud of its role in securing funding for the fourth round of the PEACE programme.  As Deputy Brendan Smith alluded to, it will mean &euro;0.5 billion for the region over the period 2014 to 2020.  It is important that we continue to engage fully on this issue.  Statements have been made of a positive nature but it is important that we acknowledge at this early stage that we wish to see these undoubtedly successfully programmes completed because of their importance for the region.  Indeed, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been actively involved as part of the Government's contingency planning for the withdrawal of the UK.  His Department has identified the implications of Brexit for the two programmes.  The issue is currently being addressed between my colleagues in the North and also at EU Commission level.  It is important that these issues are adequately addressed because of their importance to the region.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the points raised by Mr. Pat Doherty and Mr. Francie Molloy, and also Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, I fully agree that the priorities for advancing North-South co-operation need to take on a more intensified aspect.  Ministers have worked across a range of sectoral areas with a view towards prioritising North-South co-operation in the areas of responsibility, including joint trade missions.  There have been a number of successful trade missions by way of joint engagement, although they have been too few in number.  We can work on a further intensification and develop further joint missions that will be of mutual benefit.  We have a network of 80 embassies spread across the world and the embassy here is fully available to assist in any way that it can with Northern colleagues.  We will continue to reach out to Northern Ireland's economic and business sector to grow cross-Border economic links, as Mr. Francie Molloy quite rightly said.<\/p><p>If we look at tourism, for example, we are now achieving record results with the help of Tourism Ireland.  It is vital that we continue to build on this and of course, any fortified or hard border that would involve the checking of cars, the slowing down of transit or the introduction of checkpoints would certainly militate against that.  We need to ensure that we make every effort to maximise the benefits.<\/p><p> The audit to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred will be fed into the plenary.  There is a mechanism by which the Oireachtas is fully updated on the outcome of the plenary.  If members find it helpful, I would be happy to assist in that information programme with the Oireachtas by means of this committee.  <\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the specific matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, an issue upon which I have had some engagement in recent times.  I raised it yet again with the recently appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the course of my meeting with him.  The Government remains committed to implementing the decisions taken by the Oireachtas on two occasions in recent years.  I underlined the fact that I expect a response from the British Government to the long-standing request by the D&aacute;il.  I continue to emphasise that in the absence of a satisfactory response, this issue remains one of deep concern to every Member of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach also had the opportunity to raise the issue with the British Prime Minister.  I assure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that I will continue to engage with the British Government on this issue.  I met the families on the 42nd anniversary of the bombings and I believe Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan was also there.  This is an important issue that is relevant to her constituency and that of other Members of the House.  It is a source of regret to me that there has not been a greater level of progress on this issue but I assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise it.  I raised it at both my first and second meetings with the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire.  I look forward to making progress on this long-outstanding issue.<\/p><p> I wish to return to the legacy issue because I did not really address the question posed by Dr. Alasdair McDonnell but perhaps some of the committee members would like to come in now and I can return to that before we conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#N00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>There are five more members indicating, so we will go to them now and return to the Minister afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#O00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>That is perfect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#O00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his words, not just his opening presentation but also his answers to questions raised.  I also thank him for all of the work he undertakes.<\/p> <p>  There is concern that, in the post-referendum situation, too many of us are being asked to drift along and rely on assurances from British Ministers that there will not be any hard borders, that they will respect the Good Friday Agreement and so on, in circumstances where it is quite clear that they have no plan, map or satellite navigation system for where they want to go.  Just tailgating on those sorts of assurances is not good enough.  Like other members, including Senator Feighan and Deputy Brendan Smith, I believe we must see broader bandwidth regarding where we go from here in terms of properly protecting and upholding the Good Friday Agreement, as well as minimising and mitigating the adverse impact of the Brexit decision on the island as a whole.  That means we need a wider forum.  It is not enough to rely on whatever good exchanges take place inside the North-South Ministerial Council because it has a limited remit and is subject to veto mechanisms.  We were told today about protocols that prevented a document prepared by the Civil Service in the North assessing the adverse impact of Brexit from being published.  It could not be published because people were able to use the veto mechanism to which I refer.<\/p><p>That mechanism also extends to the work of the North-South Ministerial Council, both to its agenda and any outcomes.  In circumstances where that veto is held by people who campaigned in a cavalier way for Brexit, and with complete disregard for its wider implications, many of us are under-assured when we are told that much of this can be taken care of by the North-South Ministerial Council.  We need to ensure, therefore, that there are broader channels of consideration, and I do not just mean party political involvement.  There needs to be key sectoral inputs and considerations on a North-South basis.<\/p><p> In that regard, I hope the Irish Government would not be curtailed by the reaction to the Taoiseach's remarks in Glenties in making very clear that any new EU-UK treaty catering for Brexit must make explicit provision in respect of Irish unity, and that in the event of people in Ireland voting for a United Ireland there would be no question mark over new terms having to be negotiated for the North to come in to a United Ireland and into the EU or new terms having to be negotiated for the South as well.  It is not enough to rely on the precedent of Germany because many people are saying we are in different circumstances and that said precedent would not be invoked.  We cannot say there would not be a problem.  We have to deal with it in terms that explicitly relate to the Good Friday Agreement because unless they are assured it is directly and specifically to do with the Good Friday Agreement, other countries elsewhere in Europe will be wary of the precedent of regions being able to member state \"shop or hop\" in that regard.  That is why explicit and unique provision has to be made.  We cannot be overly sensitive to the complaints we might hear from some Unionist politicians when we make that point.  Equally, we cannot be too sensitive to some of the sensitivities I hear from some English colleagues in the House of Commons when we make these points.  The latter will say that they do not want to discuss the matter because Scotland will insist on something being negotiated to allow it be able to come in or that, in the event of independence, it will have a smooth path to membership.<\/p><p> We must take care of our interests and principles as mandated by people when they voted, North and South, for the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to put those at a premium.  The Irish Government has a bigger responsibility, given the terms of the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, in respect of protecting the Good Friday Agreement's provisions in those sorts of areas than has the British Government.  There are comments we will need to hear from the Irish Government in respect of its singular role as a guarantor of the Agreement rather than us just hearing that there will be commitments by the two Governments as co-guarantors.<\/p><p> In respect of the hard border issue, that might be an easy issue to deal with because everybody seems to be saying that they are opposed to a hard border or that nobody wants it.  However, as the Minister rightly said, some of that may not be entirely in our own hands, depending on decisions that are made elsewhere or by others in the EU.  Even if we avoid what people are calling a hard border - a physical customs post - the fact is that there will be a danger of incipient \"borderism\" because the more we have a difference of standards and the less commonality around regulations, standards and laws, the more some people will make it their business to enforce those differences and seek them to be policed, even by businesses, groups and individuals.  It is that level of incipient borderism about which many people are concerned.  We should not underestimate that it exists, even in the current context.<\/p><p>One need only look at what happens to wedding cars crossing the Border in some parts of the country to see that borderism exists, even under the current regime.  We are told that there will be no agenda for borderism and that everything will work smoothly under the Agreement.  There was an element of borderism in recent times when the haulage levy was introduced in the North by the current Minister for immigration, who did not seem to care about the Good Friday Agreement and who argued that his Government's policies required him to act in a way that did not treat people in Northern Ireland differently from their counterparts anywhere else.  I mention that as an example of where people apply the policies they have in Great Britain and extend them equally to Northern Ireland.  In recent times, the British Government has increasingly spoken about immigration and terrorism together.  We saw it in Theresa May's statement after the G20 summit, one section of which was headed \"immigration and terrorism\".  I accept that another word was thrown in there.  The word \"refugees\" was used in the text but not in the heading.  The Westminster Government is increasingly talking about immigration and terrorism together and using the same instruments to deal with them.<\/p><p> We should remember that terrorism legislation passed in the Westminster Parliament in recent years makes specific provisions about the Border area in Northern Ireland.  The power of police or anybody with constabulary powers to seize a passport at airports or ports, or within a mile of airports or ports, applies specifically to any area within a mile of the land border in Northern Ireland.  When James Brokenshire was introducing this legislation as the Minister responsible for it, he clarified for me that it applies to anywhere within a mile as the crow flies.  There is already pressure in the UK for that to be extended.  People are asking why the use of these powers should be limited to within a mile of ports and airports and calling for the relevant area to be extended.  Although this is supposedly a terrorism measure, we have to fear that the increasing tendency to address terrorism and immigration together in statements and in legislative terms could have implications for how the Border is treated that are not flashing on the radar at the moment.  The point I am making is that those of us in Border areas who are dealing with these issues and listening to British Ministers when they are addressing their own colleagues, and not just when they are addressing audiences in Dublin or Northern Ireland, are aware that such Ministers are not reliably showing the care and regard for the Good Friday Agreement that we would hope they would show for it.  We have to take that care to ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Durkan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I ask members to keep their contributions as brief as possible.

If Brexit takes place - I presume it will because that is what the UK authorities are saying - we will not enjoy the Single Market free trade arrangements we have at present.  As Deputy Brendan Smith said, many agrifood and drinks businesses are engaged in part-manufacture North and South.  They enjoy free movement of goods but it is obvious that this will not be allowed when controls and tariffs are introduced.  As Mark Durkan said, regardless of how well-meaning UK assurances are, they count for naught.  I think the current uncertainty and volatility will continue with substantial adverse consequences for trade, etc., as we go forward.  Britain has totally set its face against any free movement or immigration.  As a country that will continue to be an EU member state, Ireland will not be able to stop people from coming here.  We would like to see free movement across the Border, but I cannot see Britain allowing it.  I see significant adverse consequences.  I do not know how the Minister will address them.  I know he means well and he has been doing everything possible.  I think this is continuing in the dark.  The Minister hinted that we will be grappling with cotton wool until we get into negotiations.  We cannot get a grip on anything.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's further comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#Q00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I suppose one of the startling facts about the situation relating to the Border is that there are more land crossings between North and South than there are between the EU and all of the countries to the east of it, which would make one mindful of the scale of the problem we face.  I have one specific question, as colleagues have touched on many areas.<\/p> <p>  On our position on the European Court of Human Rights because it forms part of the Good Friday Agreement, the UK has been trying to leave the European Court of Human Rights for a long time.  Long before Brexit, they have been giving out about it.  The Irish position, I would propose, and hope the Minister would support, is that, whatever about Britain - being England, Scotland and Wales - retaining jurisdiction and being able to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, Northern Ireland should remain under it.  It is desperately complex to see, if a country is leaving, how the European Court of Human Rights would still have such jurisdiction, but that might be.  Norway and Switzerland may be under the European Court of Human Rights and countries which are not necessarily in the EU would come under that court.<\/p> <p>  As my colleagues have pointed out, the British public representatives do not understand the scale of the problem they face.  Mr. Dan O'Brien pointed out that this is like doing 55 trade negotiations simultaneously, and one trade negotiation can take seven years.  When one is trying to conduct not only trade negotiations but a fishery agreement, a security agreement, a health agreement and an education one all at the same time, it beggars belief.  The problem here is we need to make a special case for Northern Ireland because the European project is, in essence, a peace process.  The EU itself is a peace process.  Northern Ireland still is a peace process and this has the potential to destabilise the peace process.  That is the way we need to get our European colleagues to understand it.  This has the potential to destabilise Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#R00100","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Briefly, grave concerns have been expressed to me, as a representative from a Border constituency, about the uncertainty in cross-Border trade, farming - already, the cattle and sheep trade has been affected as a result of this - and sterling in future.

The Minister outlined some of the issues in relation to concerns.  Somebody mentioned also the &euro;10 haulage levy which is having a detrimental effect on quite a number of hauliers.  Finally, the Minister might outline the progress made against organised crime in rural areas.  Organised crime still has a damaging effect in the Border economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#R00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>There are two more speakers, briefly, Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Black.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#R00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It has been a comprehensive discussion so far, I say respectfully, because, through no fault of his own, the Minister has told us a whole lot without really telling us anything.  I suppose that is the nature of the climate we are operating in post Brexit.  When the British Government does not know what it is doing, I do not expect the Minister to be able to come in here and deal with some of the issues that have been put to him.<\/p> <p>  As a committee, our remit is to look at the implementation of the Agreement and for me, as well as the obvious and consistent concern that has been raised here about the Border, there are a number of other fairly fundamental issues.  Some members have touched on the European funding and no doubt we will have a discussion with the Minister, Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir MLA, about that, but nothing will convince me that any British Government will reimburse or replace the moneys that we receive from the EU, whether it is for peace initiatives, infrastructure, agriculture or whatever, particularly at a time when the British Government has already cut &pound;4 million out of the block grant.  We are in danger of being removed from the human rights protections that are afforded to us under membership of the EU against our will.<\/p><p>We are being left marooned by a Government that refuses to introduce the UK Human Rights Act in the North and, in the context of some of the earlier remarks, that is currently using national security as a veto in terms of some of the legacy issues we face.  Furthermore, on a point of particular importance to me, the only protections afforded to the Irish-speaking community in the North in the absence of the Act are those of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.<\/p><p> As the Minister is aware, 56% of people have voted to remain in the EU and an even higher percentage of individuals throughout the country voted for the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a danger of us being marooned by a decision taken by England and Wales.  We need to get to a point where the Minister is better informed in terms of the broader experience throughout the country.  Two court cases are currently under way in the North challenging this decision.  Next weekend, business leaders, those from the community sector and others are organising and mobilising around the Border communities against this decision.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for what has been a comprehensive discussion.  I believe we need to get to a position where the Minister is able to come to us.  More important, in terms of the negotiation that will take place at EU level, he should be acutely aware of the dangerous subversion of the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions that the vote taken in England represents.<\/p><p> I will conclude on this point.  One of the opening remarks made by the Minister related to seeking to protect the institutions such as the North-South Ministerial Council, etc.  However, the decision in respect of the Border could be taken elsewhere by the European member states.  This already presents an obvious contradiction.  Paramount in terms of our role is protecting the legitimacy and primacy of the Agreement.  It is very positive that the Minister acknowledges the need for a national discussion and forum to outline some of the issues.  I hope we will have the opportunity at institutions such as this and others to tease out these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#R00400","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.

The issues that have arisen relate to mental health and addiction.  In a way, it is a crisis.  We are talking about people's lives.  Indeed, we are not only talking about people's lives, we are talking about the legacy of the conflict on the people in the North.  It is vital that we work towards getting funding for these communities, because they are keeping things going.

I wish to acknowledge the importance of funding from the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government and my Department.  Since its establishment, the reconciliation fund has seen in excess of &euro;46 million disbursed to a total of almost 2,000 projects.  Of course, we will continue to ensure that these funds are made available.  This is an issue of importance in the context of the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p>This is a priority for me as we continue to address issues that are directly impacting on people's lives, families and communities if we are to create a better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  This issue has been the subject matter of discussions between the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire, and me.<\/p><p> Regarding Senator Daly's comments, I wish to address the Human Rights Act and what the Government is doing to ensure that the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected and not affected in any way that might be regarded as adverse.  It is important to note that the European Convention on Human Rights is a separate regime from the EU.  Leaving the EU does not mean leaving the convention.  In terms of the protection of human rights within Northern Ireland's law, the incorporation of the convention is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  I stand by the Agreement as far as this issue is concerned.  There is an ongoing legal obligation to incorporate the convention in Northern Ireland's law, one that should not, will not and cannot be affected by the decision to leave the EU.  I raised this matter two weeks ago with the Secretary of State, who confirmed the British Government's position, in that any change that may be envisaged by the British Government to the UK's Human Rights Act would be made in such a way as to be fully consistent with the British Government's obligation under the Good Friday Agreement.  Mr. Durkan is right, in that we have a legal position on this matter.  That is important in the context of the Irish Government being a co-guarantor of the Agreement.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely.  I also raised this issue with the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. David Davis.  I will reiterate what has been stated to me at a meeting: this issue is acknowledged by the British Government.  I will keep a close eye on it.<\/p><p> Deputy McLoughlin asked what was being done for the north west.  He is right that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU could have an adverse impact on trade and commerce in the Border area.  The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with A Fresh Start, we have committed &euro;2.5 million to developments in the north west.  I look forward to the Northern Executive matching this fund.  There are people present who are in the Executive, so they might be able to bring back from this meeting the message that, although &euro;5 million is obviously considerably better than &euro;2.5 million, our &euro;2.5 million is there.  This issue will be the subject matter of discussion at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary session, which has been scheduled for 18 November.<\/p><p> Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Feighan and Mr. Durkan spoke about the need for wider engagement.  They were right.  We have the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the North-South Parliamentary Forum, which has perhaps not been as actively engaged in recent times as it might have been.  It may take on an added level of importance in the context of these discussions.  We also have this committee.  However, there is a need for broader channels.  We must engage with civil society and business.  Recently, I met trade union interests, whose concerns must also be taken on board.<\/p><p> As to farmers, Mr. Molloy, I do not know how many pigs cross the Border, but more than 50,000 cattle cross it every year.  It is essential that we ensure this type of agricultural engagement and free movement of agricultural produce.  Education is also important.<\/p><p>We need a broader conversation.  The Taoiseach is aware of that and addressed the matter in the D&aacute;il prior to this meeting's commencement.<\/p><p> I will reply briefly to Mr. Molloy and Senator Daly regarding the united Ireland provision.  This is an issue in which I stand by the terms, provisions and letter of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a part of my solemn obligation and duty to ensure that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected and provided for in any new arrangement between the EU and the UK.  There will be two sets of negotiations.  In the context of the withdrawal, Ireland will be firmly at the table.  The UK will not.  Therefore, it is important that we engage in a way that is fully respectful of the issues at hand.  In that context, I find this engagement useful.  We must ensure that the interests of the people, economy and society of Northern Ireland are taken on board by those who are at the table.  That will include the Irish Government, but we must acknowledge that the principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are firmly built into the Good Friday Agreement, which was endorsed by a large majority of people North and South in the spring or early summer of 1998.  That is where I stand on this issue.  I have impressed upon my British Government colleagues, and the Taoiseach has impressed upon Prime Minister May, the need to ensure that the letter, spirit and principles of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected.<\/p><p> Regarding the Border, it is important to acknowledge what Prime Minister May said while in Belfast as well as the early visit by the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. Davis, who met some of those present.  I met him for over an hour in Dublin.  I asked him to visit Dublin and he did so at an early date.  It was the first of many engagements.  I have had a number of engagements with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, who spoke to some of those present while in Belfast.  It is important that we continue to engage at this level to ensure that our position on the matter of the Border is acknowledged by Britain.<\/p><p> Having spoken to each of my other 26 EU colleagues, there is an acknowledgement, understanding and appreciation of the peace process and the unique status of the island of Ireland in the forthcoming negotiations, the important role played by the EU in the peace process and the need to ensure that the impact on cross-Border relations is minimised.  I will continue to engage at that level.  It will of course be an issue that features on the agenda during the negotiations.<\/p><p> On the matter of legacy issues, I apologise to Dr. McDonnell and others who raised it.  This issue was discussed in considerable detail during my discussions with Mr. Brokenshire at our bilateral meeting in Dublin two weeks ago.  He has been engaging in a round of talks with the wider community.  While some of us North and South were otherwise engaged in electoral matters earlier in the year, my officials were engaged in rounds of talks with victims and survivors.<\/p><p>These consultations proved to be very valuable and will inform the approach in having agreement ultimately reached on these issues.  It is a source of regret that we did not get matters finally over the line in the context of the Stormont House Agreement.  We have agreed that the legacy institutions, as identified in the Stormont House Agreement, still offer the best way forward.  It is a comprehensive framework allowing for the needs of victims and survivors to be central to the approach.  I acknowledge the input of Mr. McDonnell's party colleagues in reaching agreement.  It is important that we can show an earnest willingness now to move forward on the limited number of issues upon which we need to find consensus.  The setting up of the institutions should not be held up by dealing with the final chapter of the agreement.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the contribution of all party members around the table, particularly those in the North.  I know Deputy Brendan Smith consistently raises these issues through parliamentary questions and debate.  I look forward to reporting progress on that before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#S00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank the Minister on behalf of the committee for being with us today and his patience in answering everybody's questions.

It is an agreement which, as stated in its very first line, offered a truly historic opportunity for a new beginning.  Forcing us in the North from the EU would breach the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement.  For today's conversation I wish to leave party politics at the door.  However, as Minister for Finance in the North, my position on the referendum is today as it was before the vote.  I thought we should remain in the European Union and I believe it is the only way forward for our people in the North.  It is my firm view that it is not economically, financially or socially advantageous for the North to cut itself off from the rest of the European Union.<\/p><p> In terms of the fiscal implications of the referendum, my most immediate concern is that we fully protect the funding we are due to get from Europe.  My Department is directly responsible for PEACE IV and INTERREG V programmes worth approximately &euro;550 million or &pound;500 million.  Our task is to safeguard the &euro;1.6 billion earmarked for programmes in the North and the Border region between now and 2020.  I listened carefully to Senator Black refer earlier to some of the great projects she works with in north Belfast but it is true that PEACE and INTERREG money has been disproportionately channelled towards areas that are underserved.  It has gone to the likes of Sandy Row and Tiger's Bay, the Bogside, Creggan and so on in the Border regions.  In the round of programmes between 2007 and 2013, projects such as the Skainos Centre in east Belfast - an inspirational cross-community project - the Peace bridge in Derry and the People&rsquo;s Park in Portadown manifested what the PEACE programme is about and how it can boost and invigorate communities.<\/p><p> The statement from the British Chancellor, Mr. Hammond, in August falls far short of what we wanted to see, particularly with respect to PEACE and INTERREG cross-Border programmes.  He gave a commitment that project approvals contracted in advance of the autumn statement, now confirmed as 23 November, will be underwritten by the Treasury.  This is insufficient and leaves &euro;1.1 billion, due to be issued post-November, at risk.  However, my concern is equally for the &euro;550 million or &pound;500 million earmarked for release before the autumn statement.  In that regard, and this is where the rubber hits the road, we have &euro;120 million of letters of offer for cross-Border, transformative job, environmental and health projects log-jammed in the system.  There are 17 separate INTERREG letters of offer that have been cleared and are ready to issue.  This affects the constituencies we have heard about in Donegal, Louth, Fermanagh, south Armagh and others, as well as health boards on both sides of the Border, for example.  InterTradeIreland has extensive programmes for small and medium enterprises that could be affected.  The letters of offer are stuck in the system.<\/p><p> The Executive, the Finance Department, the special EU peace body and the INTERREG panels have all stepped up to expedite these funding applications.  They have done Trojan work to speed up the process to ensure money is released to the bridge builders, peacemakers and job creators on the ground.  However, I would respectfully suggest that their efforts need to be matched by the Irish Government, the British Government and the EU Commission.  Notwithstanding the limbo in which we live and the grave difficulties surrounding the EU referendum, all three of those institutions should commit to releasing this &euro;120 million as soon as possible.<\/p><p> From what I have heard, people realise this is not a problem confined to one part of the island and it affects us all.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated, the Irish Government has a key role to play  in the interest of all on this island in the day-to-day dealings with the British Government and the EU side of the negotiating table.  The case needs to be made to the rest of the states in the European Union and the British Government that future arrangements must recognise and respond to the unique challenges we face here in Ireland.<\/p><p> Bagairt ar an oile&aacute;n ar fad a bheadh i dTuaisceart &Eacute;ireann a tharraingt amach &oacute;n Eoraip.

The people he referred to have done Trojan work in their communities and some local statutory agencies were very good at assisting local communities in drawing down funding that has been put to very good use.  We have a vacuum now.  We have uncertainty, and it will do great damage to the community ethos and spirit of trying to draw down very valuable and much-needed funding for so many areas that are very severely disadvantaged and need the injection of capital for social enterprise or the provision of local community facilities, be it of a social nature or of small business interest.<\/p><p>After reading remarks that were attributed to Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir in the <i>Irish News<\/i>, I tabled a parliamentary question and, like my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, I received an assurance, as I saw it, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, that the funding would be in place.

It is scandalous if the British Government is already ensuring this unnecessary uncertainty is setting in to damage projects we need to bring to fruition after so much good work undertaken by so many people in a voluntary capacity, and local statutory agencies which have never got enough funding to carry out their work at local level.

They know where I stand on it.  As representatives for Cavan and Louth, the Deputies here will make their views known.  While I am not here to ascribe blame to anyone, they are logjams.  One example is the Shared Waters Enhancement and Loughs Legacy, SWELL, project in Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle, which has been there since July.  We want them to be released.  It is a hiatus that none of us want to see.<\/p> <p>  I cannot elaborate any more.  We have done our work.  There is &euro;120 million there.  The groups we have spoken about are exemplary in the work they do.  I met members of the Higher Attainment through Cross-Border Hubs, HATCH, group which works in Cavan getting ethnic minorities into entrepreneurship, during the past period of our PEACE programme.  These are all INTERREG projects which are ready to go.  I know the Deputies will follow it up tomorrow and we are doing what we can.<\/p> <p>  Regarding North-South co-operation and the Dublin-Belfast corridor, it dismays me that the idea conceived by Sir George Quigley has been moribund for a while.  The most proactive project I saw around the Border region was the Louth-Newry and Mourne memorandum of understanding.  I would like more action behind it.  As the representatives of the Border regions know, and as our friends in InterTradeIreland always tell us, while the Border region is on the periphery of two economies, in an all-island economy it is at the centre of the economy.  As I say to my Unionist colleagues, this is not a political point.  One can support an all-island economy for the job and wealth creation benefits, not for the politics.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of what happens, we need to step up, especially regarding Cavan and Donegal.  I am a big fan of the north-west gateway initiative.  We really need to step up the economic work along the corridor.  Dundalk had a jobs blow recently.

I want to talk about minimising or reducing the damage Brexit will do to everyone regardless of politics, class, creed or anything else.  It is important not just along the Border.

It is a pleasure to have listened to him although I have become increasingly depressed this afternoon by the lack of certainty around Brexit and what it means, not only for the community in Northern Ireland but also for Ireland as a 32-county island.  I am deeply depressed when I think about where we are going.  I note Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir's comment that it is his fervent wish to remain at the heart of Europe but I am afraid that decision has been taken from him.  Westminster has decided it is not interested in him or the 56% of his electorate that voted to stay in Europe.  Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir's immediate concern is to safeguard &euro;1.6 billion of funding that was due for the North.  If I was a bureaucrat in Brussels looking at the speedy applications coming in from the North of Ireland in respect of funding, would I be as inclined to be speedy in my replies or would I say \"These guys are out of the equation and one of their Commissioners has gone home, so why should I expedite anything?\"?<\/p> <p>  To return to what Dr. McDonnell just said, what plans are there if this funding does not materialise?  Does Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir expect that Westminster will make up for the funding from Brussels that will be lost?  I do not expect that and I do not see funding coming from the Dublin Government to make up for lost funding.  I am beginning to see many problems.  I spoke about a hard border on the day after the referendum and today there is absolutely no assurance that we will not have such a border.  I am now leaning towards the possibility of a border and all the damage it will bring to our country and its economy and to the Northern Ireland economy.  We are deeply interlinked.  Senator Francis Black referred earlier to some of the programmes being run in north Belfast.  I look at the number of youngsters coming down to universities in Dublin.  They will have to pay their way.  Where will the Northern Ireland Executive find the funding for that?  Does it expect Westminster to step in and pick up the tab?  As Minister of Finance, Mr. &Oacute; Muilleoir is in a horrible position in the firing line.  I do not see the funding coming to run the country at the level at which it is currently being run.  To return to Dr. McDonnell's point, have all members of the Executive sat down together?

I do not want him going home depressed.  If we accepted everything that the holy trinity of Brexit Ministers in London wishes to accept, we would give up.  Prime Minister May has had to chastise David Davis, whom I met, Liam Fox, the business Minister, and the wonderful Boris Johnson.  If one picks up a newspaper each day, one will have a different idea of what the British intend to do about Brexit.  We do not know.  It is very difficult and I use the analogy that it is like grappling with cotton wool.  It is difficult to have a really coherent plan.  This is what we are doing.  I agree with the Senator absolutely.<\/p> <p>  I return to Dr. McDonnell's point on agricultural payments.  The British Chancellor said that he will guarantee the PEACE IV and INTERREG moneys if they are signed off by November 23.  He further stated that, in the context of Structural Funds, the social fund and PEACE IV moneys, after that Northern Ireland will be on its own.  That was bad enough because it put about &euro;1.1 billion in peril.  We cannot move the &pound;500 million or &euro;550 million we had hoped to get out the door before that statement was made.  I am asking for the help of everyone here to try to get the money that has been agreed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of agriculture, the British Chancellor said he would underwrite the CAP payment of approximately &euro;2.2 billion up until the exit, whenever that happens, or 2020.   Farmers in the North get 9% of farm payments to the UK.  We have no idea what will happen after 2020.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has more faith in Mr. James Brokenshire than I have.  I would be amazed if, after 2020 when we are forced out of the EU, the British Government gives us 9% of all farm payments.  I suspect it will be more like 3%.  There is a danger that farm payments will fall off a cliff in 2020.<\/p> <p>  What Dr. McDonnell said is absolutely right.  It is amazing how often, when one visits groups in Belfast's inner city, one sees a plaque on the wall that says it is funded by the European Union, under the PEACE programmes or by means of the social fund.  With regard to peace and reconciliation, the group WAVE, which works with victims and survivors, Relatives for Justice, which works with victims and survivors, and so many ex-prisoner groups rely on Europe for support.  It will go to the very heart of the work in which Dr. McDonnell, Mark Durkan and our colleagues from mid-Ulster and west Tyrone are involved in trying to build our communities.  It will be a grievous blow to efforts to build peace and foster reconciliation.  We should not accept it.  We have turned the ship of state of the British Government before.  It would be unwise to accept, when it does not know what it is doing, that it has to be a particular type of exit.  Those of us who voted to remain will defend the democratic right to remain and also the right of the people of Wales and England to leave.  We will make common cause with our friends in Scotland on this.  We want the Irish Government to say that the right of the people of the North trumps what they call the UK-wide vote.  In that, the Taoiseach has an onerous responsibility.  He has a tough job ahead of him.  He has to go to the British and say that we need to have a bespoke arrangement.  There should be a bespoke arrangement to ensure that we would still have protections and a right to enjoy the privileges of the Single Market, the freedom of movement of labour and membership of the European Union.  Someone mentioned earlier how complex that would be.  It is complex but it can be done.  It is very simple - we voted to remain so we should be allowed to remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see the Minister, Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, here again.

I recognise he is in the difficult position of trying to optimise what is supposedly there with the Treasury&rsquo;s offer in circumstances where he may not get the optimum spend and use out of the money and that he is dealing with constraints he did not create himself.  I picked up his warning that he needs the assistance and efforts of others to ensure it is optimised in so far as that window is concerned.<\/p> <p>  For the longer term, does the Minister think it is feasible to get to a situation where the North can still continue to have access to benefits and programmes of the EU, even in the context of Brexit, given the North&rsquo;s unique position under the Good Friday Agreement as an international agreement?  Could we have a lean-to arrangement with the South in that context?  In terms of access to EU funding, if some of the principle was around the question of matched funding, could we look at the possibility of specifically earmarking those moneys, due to be paid by the Irish Government to the UK Government in respect of what is called the &ldquo;Osborne loan&rdquo;, to support North-South spending?  Could they be used to supplement, complement or provide continuity of funding in respect of EU programmes?  If it is not possible to use it as the matching funding, could it be used at least to ensure there was some continuity funding in respect of the sort of programmes and measures which are already supported by the EU?<\/p> <p>  It would be entirely consistent with the spirit of the Agreement if the funding was used in that way.  That is what people envisaged was going to happen over time not just here, but among those who agreed these measures in the EU and their projected time cycle.  It would also provide a basis for underpinning future North-South work, even beyond that directly funded by the EU programmes.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that much of the functionality that has come from the implementation bodies and from the North-South sectors has related to EU programmes and measures and has relied in large part on EU funding or on agreeing how to transpose EU standards.  The reality is that the fillings of the North-South sandwich after this are going to be small.  Many people are seeing aspects of the Good Friday Agreement being hollowed out.  We need to think creatively in that funding area by not just replacing the headline funds to which the Minister referred, but in supporting the fact there is real and meaningful North-South traffic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Durkan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474992000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I have been accused of many things but not usually of being anaemic.  Within diplomatic international standards, this is as hard as I get.  I do not believe one can get any more hardline than saying, \"I insist we remain at the heart of Europe\".  Even before St. Columbanus and St. Gall left Bangor monastery in 590 AD to bring Christianity to Bobbio and St. Gallen in Europe, we were Europeans.  We are Europeans today and are committed to the project.  There are aspects we would all like to improve.  One cannot let one's head go down and say we will accept on this island that they take the North and we get into this Little England splendid isolation cul-de-sac.  It would be a cul-de-sac of culture, education and international relations.<\/p> <p>  When speaking as a Minister on these matters, I do not like using the word \"fight\" but we are going to stand very firm behind the democratic wishes of the people of the North.  If consent is a pillar of the Good Friday Agreement, it should also be a pillar of the leaving or staying in the EU.  I want to bolster Senator Feighan's confidence in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The work of this committee is really appreciated.  The work of former Senators Sean Barrett and Mary White was appreciated at An Chult&uacute;rlann on the Falls Road, in Derry and east Belfast.  It means much to people at the Skainos Centre who did great work in resolving the flag protests by creating an oasis of discussion, calm, dialogue and reconciliation.  We sometimes underestimate the positive impact of this committee.  It is great that it provided a forum for this discussion.<\/p> <p>  Mark Durkan used the term \"special case\".  I believe there is sympathy in Europe for a special case.  After the Apple tax finding, there might be some bruised egos and relationships.  However, the idea of the special case has always been very dear to all European Union member states.  They agreed to the PEACE funding and voted repeatedly to endorse the Good Friday Agreement and other steps forward in the peace process.  If anyone can make a special case to Europe about finding a process or a bespoke arrangement for the North to remain, it is us.  In fact, in many ways, we have more sympathy in Europe than Scotland has, although it's people voted in more resounding numbers to stay.  We have our foot in the door and we need to make that argument.<\/p><p>I would be happy to ask the Taoiseach to do his bit.  However, I have no doubt that representatives from the North, and I speak for Pat Doherty, Francie Molloy, Mark Durkan and Alasdair McDonnell, will fight hard - it is proper to use the \"F\" word in this particular circumstance - to ensure that we remain, not only because that is how people voted but also because the alternative is a road to nowhere.<\/p><p> Mark Durkan touched on the following point.  The equilibrium of the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace we have reached in the North is underpinned by the fact that both jurisdictions on the island are part of the European Union.  That is one of the reasons we managed to make this historic compromise.  For anyone to tear that asunder willy-nilly and view it as a victory is a mistake.  There is common ground.  The crucial part of this is unity within the Executive and there is no sense in pretending that the latter is going to be easy to achieve.  However, we have forged some common ground in that the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, penned a joint letter to Theresa May setting out the five areas, including agrifood, on which they want her to focus.  That is a start.  I am confident that if we can ensure that we have a central place at the negotiating table, with Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness on one side and the Taoiseach on the other with the European member states, there will be a chance to put a really strong case forward.  I am certainly not despairing.  I do not really mind from where the British Government gets the money.  It is spending &pound;100 billion on Trident so I am sure it can find the money somewhere.

I note the reference to &pound;120 million, but on rural, peace and other funding, is there any mechanism whereby the Assembly can draw down the funds from Europe in advance of the moneys actually being distributed?  If we wait until the end of the various processes, the schedule for actually delivering the money on the ground will be tight.  There have been difficulties in getting the money distributed to different projects in the past.  The question on European funding relates to the fact that 11 of the 18 constituencies voted to remain.  In what circumstances can that remain vote be respected by Europe and others?  Is there an all-Ireland solution as regards the framework and also given the change in circumstances whereby 11 of the 18 constituencies voted to remain, whatever that means in terms of the 50% required to change the Good Friday Agreement?  To some extent, we have been dealing with a false economy because of the European funding that has supported everything over the past while.  That change in circumstances will change the whole financial structure.  Where does that leave corporation tax in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.

I was amazed by its beauty.  I passed Senator Black's old homestead where she does some of her great work.  She is a great believer in rising above some of the problems that beset us, trying to find a way through them and identifying solutions.  There are difficulties for us in identifying the solutions to a proposed Brexit because the British have not said what it means.  In fact, they have very clearly disagreed.  David Davis has pointed to a hard Brexit while Theresa May has said that will not be the case.  Boris Johnson says negotiations will start early in the new year while Theresa May says it is not possible to say that.  Liam Fox says that British businessmen are fat and lazy.  The confusion among the British is very difficult.  While they get themselves organised, we need to draw some little lines in the sand.  One issue is that we need to remain, so what could that mean?  Is it possible?  I think Europe is sympathetic.  If we call it a special case, how can we remain and what would that mean?  Under that, we then work out the special dispensations we need on all the different aspects of work, in particular to ensure that the funding continues.  This requires a civic society response and a political response.  It requires a business response.  CBI and IBEC have been some of the firmest in saying that we are entering an economic cul-de-sac.  I would like to see a thousand flowers bloom in this case, which is to say I would like a thousand voices to be raised, starting in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  An issue in respect of which Senator Black has been supportive is that of ethnic minorities.  I do not go to church very often, but on Sunday I went to the Roma church in Dr. McDonnell's constituency in south Belfast.  There were 350 Roma present.  The Roma have made great lives for themselves here and refer to the great progress they have made in this country compared to the way they were treated in Romania.  Their children are now in school here, but they are fearful that they will be put out.  When I met David Davis, I asked him to give me a guarantee that every European Union citizen who is here would be allowed to say and he said they could not do it.  As such, one can understand the fear among communities.  That is one example of a particularly vulnerable community.  One can understand the fear among ethnic minorities, which is even before one talks about the researchers in universities and so on.  These are people who have made a great contribution to Belfast.  I refer to Lithuanians, Poles and so on.  Where do they stand?  The voices that are raised need a forum.  Sometimes, people think a forum is for republicans and nationalists to come to talk at, but I would like the ethnic minorities to come and make their points.  I would like those members of the unionist community who have now applied for Irish passports to come and say why they believe their future lies with Europe.  I have signed a large number of their applications as, I am sure, have many of my colleagues.  I would like the entrepreneurs and those who live along the Border to come.  Let the politicians be last in the queue at the forum but let us have one where people can voice their fears and opinions and try to agree the best way forward for all of our people.  By the way, I congratulate Senator Black on her election.<\/p> <p>  I was asked if we are the meat in the sandwich.  Sometimes, I think that is the case.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and I were mandated by the North-South Ministerial Council to write to EU Commissioner Creu to say that we needed her to guarantee the funding or to tell us where we stand.  The Commissioner said that it would not be possible to tell until the negotiations started.  I understand entirely.  They are waiting for the London Government to say what it wants to do.  As such, we are the meat in the sandwich between these two great forces that are meeting and preparing for negotiations.  It is very important that our voice is raised in Europe and that we say that it is not good enough and a betrayal of the peace process to allow us to be no more than the meat in the sandwich.  The people of this island who voted for and built the peace deserve a great deal more than to be cast aside and forced out of Europe as part of this proposed catastrophe of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We have a great deal to do in terms of Mr. Francie Molloy's point.  No one should raise his or her voice louder than farmers and the agricultural and rural community.  They know how vital Europe has been to their livelihoods as well as to reconciliation and peace in the rural areas which suffered so much during the 30 years of turmoil and warfare.<\/p><p>Therefore everyone's voice should be raised.  This will not be finished tomorrow or next week.  It was suggested that it could take two or three years, and I have heard six years mentioned.  In my view it will be a determined, concerted battle to remain.  We have started to rally our forces and arguments to remain, but it will continue in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016092700002#EE00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474992000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I have one brief comment.

On behalf of Age Action, I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it about our recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection.  I am the senior policy officer at Age Action and lead the organisation's policy team, which includes responding to a wide variety of policy issues that impact on the lives of older people.<\/p><p>Capturing the lived experience of older people in Ireland to ensure our recommendations will have a positive impact on their lives is of critical importance to this work.  Earlier this year, over April and May, our policy team consulted with Age Action Ireland members throughout Ireland in preparation for our submission for budget 2017.  This included a series of meetings around the country, along with distributing a survey through our magazine, <i>Ageing Matters<\/i>, and among our other networks.  Through this process, we heard from more than 400 older people and I would like to share with the committee some of the responses we received.<br\/><br\/>Catherine told us:<\/p><blockquote>I cannot afford either life or home insurance.  I have to go to bed early to save on heating and electricity.  My husband passed away last year and I still have not paid off his funeral expenses.  We did have life insurance but they cut it because we could not keep up the payments.<\/blockquote><p>Thomas described the reality of trying to make ends meet:<\/p><blockquote>The State pension is too low, especially since the extra charges were thrown at us.  I find it hard to live on &euro;233 a week and pay the property tax, along with the everyday expenses like oil, phone, food and clothing, and if one is lucky, like me, to own a car, which is ten years old, that too can become a headache with rising costs of insurance and motor tax, along with NCT bills and upkeep of the vehicle.  It is certainly hard.  That is my opinion.<\/blockquote><p>Deirdre also wrote to us<i><\/i>and stated:<\/p><blockquote>My mother cannot afford to heat her home.  She lives in one room, heating it with a fire which she does not light until the afternoon.  She goes to bed at 9.30 in the winter to save fuel.  Even with help to buy fuel she cannot afford to turn on the central heating for fear of a big bill she could not pay.<\/blockquote><p>Between January 2009 and January 2015 the weekly incomes of older people dependent on the State pension and secondary income supports, such as the household benefits package and the fuel allowance, fell by &euro;13.18 per week.  Research we are currently carrying out indicates tens of thousands of pensioners had their pensions or what they should be entitled to drastically reduced following changes to the eligibility criteria for new entrants in 2012.  According to the latest official poverty statistics from the Central Statistics Office, 10.3% of people aged 65 years and over were &quot;at risk&quot; of poverty in 2014.  This means that one in ten older people was living on less than 60% of the median income, which is less than &euro;11,000 per annum.  In 2014, some 14.3% of those aged over 65 years experienced deprivation or were unable to afford basic items such as replacing worn furniture.  According to Social Justice Ireland, this is more than 85,000 older people or approximately the combined population of Bray town and Limerick city.  In 2009, the last year in which the State pension was increased prior to 2016, the deprivation rate was much lower at 9.5%.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2016, which included a &euro;3 increase in the weekly rate of the State pension and restoration of 75% of the Christmas bonus, was the first to try to ease some of the hardship inflicted on older people over a number of successive austerity budgets but it fell far short.  Almost half of the income lost between 2009 and 2015 has still not been restored, including the telephone allowance; the number of weeks for which the fuel allowance is paid; and the decrease in the value of the electricity element of the household benefits package.<br\/><br\/>What needs to happen in budget 2017?  Earlier this year, older voters were promised by many of those candidates and parties seeking their support a minimum of a &euro;25 increase in the State pension over the next five years.  Budget 2017 is the first opportunity to make clear to almost 600,000 people over the age of 65 that the commitments made to them will be honoured.  The State pension is a critical, and often the only, source of income for older people.  According to the OECD, up to three quarters of a household's disposable income for those aged over 65 is made up of public transfers.  The national pensions framework, published in 2010, commits to &quot;sustain the value of the State pension at 35% of average weekly earnings&quot; to prevent poverty among older people.  Preliminary CSO figures for the first quarter of 2016 indicate that average weekly earnings are &euro;707.99, which would indicate a State pension of &euro;247.80, substantially higher than the current top rate of the contributory pension.<br\/><br\/>We recognise that this rate will not be achieved immediately.  However, budget 2017 must see a determined effort from the Government towards achieving the target set in the national pensions framework.<\/p><p>We are asking the Minister for Social Protection to increase the weekly rate of the State pension by &euro;5 in budget 2017, at a cost of &euro;130 million, as well as ensuring the final 25% of the Christmas bonus is restored as a double-week payment for Christmas 2016 for all social welfare recipients, which will cost approximately &euro;67 million.<\/p><p> The second issue we feel needs to be addressed is energy poverty.  We welcome the publication by the Government earlier this year of a strategy to combat energy poverty which will act as a roadmap to tackle this issue across multiple Departments and Government agencies.  The issue of energy poverty is particularly acute for older people for a number of reasons.  There is, among other issues, a tendency to spend more time in the home, a greater likelihood of living in older, less-energy efficient homes and a greater risk of cardiovascular and respiratory illness from cold and damp houses.  Given these issues, Age Action Ireland particularly welcomes the initiation of the warmth and well-being pilot programme as part of the new strategy.  We note that the long-term benefits of the scheme and the collaborative approach that is being undertaken between the Department with responsibility for communications, climate action and environment and health professionals.<\/p><p> While such programmes offer a longer-term solution to this issue, consumer behaviour among older people can also be detrimental to their energy security.  Lower rates of access to the Internet mean older people are often unable to avail of discounts only available to customers willing to transact their business online.  As a result, older people do not benefit significantly from increased competition in the energy market.  For those on low incomes, therefore, supplementary payments such as the fuel allowance are a vital support.  In recent budgets, the period for which this payment has been made was reduced from 26 weeks to 20 weeks, but winter did not get any shorter.  We are calling for budget 2017 to begin to reverse this cut to the fuel allowance by extending the scheme by four weeks, at a cost of approximately &euro;35 million.  Data from the Central Statistics Office also indicate that half of older people have oil-fired central heating.  For those dependent on small, fixed incomes, it can be difficult to pay for a fill of oil, particularly those who receive the fuel allowance as a weekly payment.  We have urged the Department previously, as have other colleagues, to provide people with the option of receiving this payment in one lump sum.<\/p><p> I am conscious of the remit of the committee.  However, I would like to advise it that we have also made submissions to five other Departments, as well as writing to the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we have called for an increase in income supports for older people within the context of the work of the committee, this can be negatively impacted by cuts or changes to the eligibility criteria of supports from other Departments.  For example, an increase in the State pension might cause a pensioner to lose his or her medical card due to the income threshold.  Decisions made by one Department have repercussions elsewhere and it is essential that this is understood and action taken to ensure gains made by older people in one part of the budget do not result in losses elsewhere.<\/p><p> Age Action Ireland has repeatedly called for a cross-departmental approach to addressing an ageing population in order to ensure that the focus on planning for an ageing society does not fall on the expenditure Departments - namely, the Departments of Social Protection and Health - alone.  We advocate that it also comes under the consideration of programmes in other Departments, such as those with responsibility for housing, planning, community and local government in terms of resourcing the housing adaptation grant, which enables older people to remain in their homes for longer, and the Department with responsibility for communications, climate action and environment in terms of addressing the issue of digital exclusion and the issue of energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Naomi Feely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will now call on Ms Fahey and then open the floor to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#J00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474968600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP, welcomes the opportunity to make a presentation on its pre-budget submission 2017.  Through direct and personal contact with those in need, SVP members see how inadequate incomes, both for those in low-paid work and those are reliant on social welfare payments, as well as a lack of access to quality services damage people's prospects and lives.  In 2015, each of our eight regional offices across the country received more than 2,300 calls for help every week.  Our 11,000 volunteer members visit people in their homes throughout Ireland.  They see at first hand how the housing and homelessness crisis, child poverty, educational disadvantage and the constant struggle of trying to make ends meet on a low income affect individuals and families.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, we spent more than &euro;14 million providing direct assistance to households through visiting people in their homes.<\/p><p>Cash assistance, vouchers and food accounted for more than half of this expenditure, while &euro;8.8 million was spent on helping households with their energy costs and &euro;4.6 million on education costs.  Our expenditure direct to households in need has increased by 27% since 2009.  This might be expected, given the extent of the cuts that have happened to low-income households.<br\/><br\/>Working for social justice is a cornerstone of SVP's mission and work, alongside home visitation and empowering people to access education, training and other supports.  We are called to challenge the social injustices we see, to engage with Government and policy makers to propose solutions and to advocate for social change.  SVP welcomes the fall in unemployment and the return to economic growth in recent years.  We believe social and economic progress must go hand in hand, with investment in quality public services and income supports yielding benefits to both the economy and the common good.<br\/><br\/>Our pre-budget submission for 2017 focuses on four priority areas, namely, income adequacy, which is of most interest to the committee; housing and homelessness, which has become a major issue for us and every organisation working in the area; early years, child care and after school care; and affordable energy and energy poverty, which Ms Feely talked about.<br\/><br\/>In the area of income adequacy, we are particularly concerned about families with children, given that it is the largest group we assist, particularly one-parent families.  One-parent families experience the highest rates of poverty and deprivation.  In 2014, more than one in five lone parents were experiencing consistent poverty, living in a household with a low income and going without basics such as adequate food and the right kind of clothing for the weather.  Almost 60% experienced material deprivation.  That figure is scandalous given that they are households with children.  Some 11.2% of children are living in consistent poverty.  The Government has made a commitment to lifting 97,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, which is a very ambitious target and one we are working towards achieving.  We believe tackling poverty among one-parent families is key if this ambitious target is to be met.<br\/><br\/>The reforms to the one-parent family payment implemented during recent years have resulted in both winners and losers.  Unfortunately, it appears that there have been more losers than winners, and for those who have gained, it has been at the expense of other low-income households.  Many of those who have lost out because of the reform have been lone parents in employment.  I have outlined in my written submission to the committee the main concerns with the reforms that lone parents have highlighted to us.  For time reasons I will not go through them now, but I am happy to take any questions that arise.  One parent affected by the reforms told us:<\/p><blockquote>My income decreased drastically by about &euro;80 per week.  That is what I pay for child care for the week, and unless I quit my job, I cannot save on child care.  I try to save on food because it seems to be the only expense I have any control over, so they have literally taken food from my daughter's mouth.  I am full of rage simply because this is being sold as a measure to support lone parents into work and education.<\/blockquote><p>I will outline our policy priorities for the Minister for Social Protection in the budget 2017.  We ask the Government to allow lone parents in employment whose children are aged between seven and 14 to receive both the jobseeker's transition, JST, payment and family income supplement, FIS, if they meet the qualifying criteria.  We are asking for this because for lone parents with younger children, the one-parent family payment, OFP, and FIS are paid together and lone parents in that situation would also receive fuel allowance.  However, when the youngest child in the household turns seven, there is a significant loss of income as working lone parents must choose between getting FIS or the jobseeker's transition payment.  Child care costs do not change much between when a child is six and seven.  They are very significant, and that is why we are requesting this change.<br\/><br\/>We are also asking that the jobseeker's transition payment and the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance grant be payable to lone parents who are undertaking a course of education for the duration of the course regardless of the age of their youngest child.  This is currently payable to lone parents of children aged under 14, which is a great support for lone parents considering taking up education or training.  However, lone parents whose youngest child is aged over 14 must transfer to the back to education allowance, BTEA, in order to maintain their incomes, and people in receipt of this cannot claim the maintenance grant, which is worth over &euro;100 per week to someone living far away from college.<br\/><br\/>Lone parents in receipt of rent supplement must decide whether to remain in receipt of the OFP or JST and receive the maintenance grant but lose their rent supplement or transfer to the BTEA and keep their rent supplement.  The complications of the system are evident from this, as are the barriers to lone parents living in rent supplement accommodation taking up education and training.<\/p><p>We recommend that lone parents in this situation should be allowed to retain their one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transitional payment and their rent supplement and also receive the maintenance grant for the duration of their education and training course.  We advise that any increases in child benefit payment should be targeted towards children aged 12 years and older in recognition of the high costs faced by families with older children.  The decision to remove child benefit from 18 year olds in full-time education has placed a heavy burden on families, particularly those on low incomes.  We request that the current rates relating to the fuel allowance and the household benefits package be protected and that the personal micro-credit initiative be supported and adequately funded.  In that regard, we welcome the decision to roll out that pilot scheme across all credit unions in Ireland as a much more affordable alternative to money lenders.<\/p><p> Our policy priorities for the Minister for Social Protection should be read in the context of our entire pre-budget submission, which emphasises investment in public services and supports over reducing taxes.  It also seeks a balance between investing in public services and income supports in order to tackle poverty and improve the lives of the people we assist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Fahey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fahey.

It is very difficult to disagree with anything they said.  I also thank them for the work they are doing to promote the interests of the elderly and to keep those interests to the forefront.  I thank the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the wonderful work is doing on the ground, which I see at first hand in my constituency on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>I have a number of brief points to raise.  The case has been made that while the monetary amount of other benefits has been reduced, pensions have not been reduced.  The point the witnesses make very well is that pensions have effectively been reduced by a withdrawal of benefits such as free telephone rental, etc.  The witnesses pointed to the ambition that the pension should be 35% of average earnings at a minimum, which would be &euro;248 per week.  The top rate at the moment for contributory old age pension is &euro;233.<\/p><p>On the fuel allowance, the witnesses are proposing to extend it by four weeks at the new rate.  The rate was changed last year.  The suggestion made with regard to a lump sum is very good.  I have come across situations in which some people are not able to enter into an agreement with the supplier to pay over a period.  Do the witnesses have any figures on the percentage of people over the age of 66 who are totally reliant on the old age pension and who have no other source of income?  I imagine we could work out the number of people over the age of 66 who have income only slightly in excess of the old age pension because one can only get the fuel allowance if one's income does not exceed the pension by &euro;100 per week.  If the witnesses can supply those figures, I would appreciate it.<\/p><p>On the presentation by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, we predicted everything Ms Fahey said about lone parents.  We predicted it in the debate on the changes.  What we have to do now is try to solve the situation and move forward.  It should be borne in mind that the group experiencing the highest poverty levels in this society is that comprising lone parents.  There is almost a 60% deprivation rate among lone parents, which is outrageous.  I have said it thousands of times and I will repeat it again.  Ms Fahey mentioned winners and losers.  I have not come across too many winners; there are mainly losers.  Lone parents, particularly those in employment, have lost out dramatically as a result of these changes.  One of the suggestions made is to allow lone parents in employment whose children are aged between seven and 14 to receive both the jobseeker's transitional payment and family income supplement if they meet the qualifying criteria.  The qualifying criterion for ordinary jobseeker's payment is that one cannot work more than three days a week.  I am not sure if the qualification for the jobseeker's transitional payment is the same.  If it is, this would be a problem.  There are anomalies in the interactions between various payments.  For example, one can get rent subsidy if one receives one type of payment and if one goes for another type of payment, one must forfeit the higher education grant.  The whole thing is like something out of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland<\/i>.<\/p><p>It seems to me that many of those anomalies have come in as a result of the changes made in reducing the age to seven.  How many of those anomalies would be sorted out if, for example, we were to revert to when the age threshold was 14?  What would need to be done in addition to that?<\/p><p> The organisations recommended an increase in rent supplement or HAP, housing assistance payment.  Both were increased recently.  What has been the actual effect of this in practice?  Has it had any impact?  A measure was introduced to freeze rent for two years.  Has that had any effect in practice?<\/p><p> I agree with the organisations that the State should be the main provider of social housing, not the private sector.  For the past six years, we have had the experience of using the private sector as the main provider of social housing.  This has not, will not and cannot work.<\/p><p> The point was made on child care that only 0.2% of gross domestic product is invested in children before they start primary school.  Are there any comparable figures for other OECD or EU countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#L00300","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Willie O'Dea, I welcome Ms Fahey and Ms Feely to this morning&rsquo;s meeting.  Since I was elected in February, I have met both organisations.  I have to put my cards on the table with regard to most, if not all, of the measures which both organisations have put forward.  I agree with them, as does my party.  We will be launching our pre-budget submission in the next week or so and most of the measures touched on in these pre-budget submissions today will be addressed by my party, as they have been in previous years.<\/p> <p>  I commend both organisations on the work they do in picking up the broken pieces the State has left behind.  Those pieces are, unfortunately, families, older people and other marginalised people who have been forgotten about.  The statistics show clearly they are the ones bearing the brunt.  Families, older people, lone parents - 60% of individuals from lone-parent households - are the most susceptible to poverty.  I commend the work of both organisations and the volunteers who work on the ground helping out people every day who go above and beyond their duty.<\/p> <p>  The winter fuel allowance payment period was cut back from 32 weeks to 26 weeks.  While there were marginal increases last year to address that aspect, the payment is not staying with the rate of inflation.  We know how much fuel costs have increased over the past several years.  Up to 28% of households across the State experience fuel poverty.  We heard the examples outlined in the submissions and I am sure we could all reiterate many cases of fuel poverty we have encountered.  These are real people rationing the amount of fuel they burn.  They go to bed when the ration of fuel runs out.  They are, for example, travelling on trains and sitting in public buildings to keep warm.  We have all come across such cases.  In 2008, the assistance the Society of St. Vincent de Paul gave to helping out families with energy costs came to &euro;3.8 million.<\/p><p>That figure jumped to &euro;10 million in 2013.  At the same time, cuts to the fuel allowance were introduced by successive Governments.  This issue certainly needs to be addressed in the forthcoming budget.  I take on board the proposal about a bulk payment.  I know some fuel companies allow customers to buy oil by the barrel or bucket at an increased cost.  That is something I am only too willing to examine and take on board.  The fuel allowance needs to be increased from 26 weeks.  We need to start reversing the cuts that have been implemented.<\/p><p> We know the old age pension qualification age was pushed out to 66 and we are aware of the impact this has had.  The State transition pension was removed in 2012.  I know Age Action Ireland has looked at this.  People who have hit retirement age after working all their lives are now forced to apply for jobseeker's allowance.  A total of 2,590 men and women aged 65 have signed on for jobseeker's allowance - more than any other category.  This sets off alarm bells.  These people are locked out of drawing down their State pension for a year - a pension for which they have paid contributions during their working lives - and are forced on claim jobseeker's allowance.  A total of 2,590 people fit into that category, which is a serious problem.  The abolition of the State transition pension has compounded the difficulties.  These older people are less well off by least &euro;45 than someone in receipt of the State pension.  This area has been highlighted and needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> PRSI contributions have increased from 260 to 520.  Again, this compounds the difficulties for our older population in respect of accessing the State pension and getting the full entitlement.  The committee needs to get its teeth into this issue.  I know there was a discussion on that matter earlier.  <\/p><p> One of the meanest cuts affecting the older population was the removal of the bereavement grant.  It was a small payment of &euro;850 to help people bury a loved one.  This cut has had an impact across the board.  We know there is discretion on the part of community welfare officers to help out in situations like that but it is at their discretion.  The removal of the bereavement grant has hit so many people at a time when they are at their most vulnerable.  It is forcing them into further debt and, in many cases, into the arms of loan sharks.  This matter needs to be considered.  Hopefully, the Minister has taken on board the submissions and will seek to reverse the cut.  <\/p><p> I have met the Irish League of Credit Unions and I welcome the fact that we have micro-credit loans.  I spoke to some people during the week who told me that not all credit unions have signed up providing such loans, which is disappointing.  Micro-credit loans are a fantastic source of funds for people who might have poor credit ratings or who might be dealing with certain organisations that charge exorbitant interest rates on loans.  More needs to be done to encourage all credit unions to sign up to the scheme to ensure that marginalised and vulnerable people can get cheap and affordable loans from credit unions.<\/p><p>The statistics show clearly that lone parents are, by far, the most susceptible to poverty.  The fact is that 97,000 children are in a constant state of poverty.  It was interesting when the Minister attended our previous meeting and I asked him what specific measures the Government had to tackle poverty, in particular child poverty.  He started to give me a lecture on the definition of poverty instead of giving a specific answer on the measures the Government was going to put in place.  I have put down parliamentary questions to the Minister asking what specific measures the Government will introduce to deal with poverty and again I have been given lectures on the improving economy.  Unless a specific measure is introduced, we will be looking, unfortunately, at all of these issues again.  I am asking about the whole issue of lone parents, the changes to the one-family payment and the impact on lone parents once a child hits seven years of age.  We know all of the stories and the case examples that have been given.  It is an issue that requires serious intervention and one which the committee will have to get its teeth into.  My party will be bringing forward specific measures in its pre-budget submission.  Hopefully, some of them will be taken on board by the Government.<\/p><p> Another timely issue on which I want to focus is the cost of sending children back to school.  We have seen the figures from the different surveys that have been carried out.  It can cost up to &euro;900 to send a child back to primary school.  For secondary school, it can cost up to &euro;1,500.  Cuts have been made to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  In 2011, it was cut from &euro;200 to &euro;150, which has had an impact.  If one looks again at the breakdown of expenditure set out by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, one can see that the demand for assistance from organisations like that spikes when cuts have been made by Government.  Expenditure on households and needs from St. Vincent de Paul has increased by 27% since 2009.  We do not have a specific breakdown to hand, but perhaps we can get one for education to see how much is being spent to help families send their children back to school.  We see that where cuts have been implemented, the demands on organisations like St. Vincent de Paul spikes.  I echo the call to increase the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  I am again critical of the Minister because when I asked him specific questions in the D&aacute;il, he provided false arguments on the Six Counties, which is not comparing like with like, instead of answering.  Education is free in the Six Counties which it is not down here given the cost of school uniforms, books, iPads and other associated IT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#M00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fahey and Ms Feely for presenting to the committee.  I have three short points and will hopefully make up some time.  The witnesses touched on the back-to-education and lone parents topic, which is one of the most important things.  Lone parents <i>en masse<\/i>are single, lone women and not enough is being done to ensure that they get the right education to allow them to pursue careers and make something of themselves.  Lack of education is one of the main reasons people remain in poverty.  Supports for women with young children to get through education constitute one of the main ways to break the poverty cycle.  I commend the witnesses on that and will definitely provide what support I can to keep it on the radar.<\/p><p>On the supplementary welfare officer role, both the witnesses' organisations have stepped in on numerous occasions to provide once-off payments.  Do both organisations have a chart setting out on what, exactly, they give people money to spend?  Is it buggies, rent or electricity bills, for example?<\/p><p>Do the organisations have some sort of pie-chart whereby I could find out on what exactly people are spending the money they give them, whether it be buggies, rent or electricity bills?

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  I know that Age Action and Social Justice Ireland have done tremendous work over the past seven years, highlighting inequality and campaigning vigorously for budgets that were tested and checked for equality.  Unfortunately, however, that has not happened.  I take on board everything the witnesses have said.  We know what we will get back from the Minister concerning a number of these issues.  Yesterday morning, I heard an RTE interview with the Minister for Social Protection where he, quite rightly, said that Fianna F&aacute;il cut the lone parent's allowance by &euro;16.  However, he then denied that the last Government played any role in cutting that allowance.  They may not have cut anything, but they determined the conditionality of the payment.  The interviewer did not know enough about the lone parent's payment to be able to challenge that.  In effect, we clearly know that in July 2015 a lone parent on &euro;9.15 per hour with a 20-hour contract was earning around &euro;4.53.  In 2017, that will be down to &euro;80.32 for a working parent.  That is the reality for lone parents on a 35-hour week.  I wanted to raise that important point at today's meeting.  We cannot let someone go on air and say that there have been no cuts to the lone parent's allowance over the last five years, or since the child turned seven.<\/p> <p>  While it is quite clear that we will not get all of them, what areas really need to be pushed which, in the witnesses' view, would have a significant impact on older people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#P00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I join with others in welcoming Ms Fahey and Ms Feely.  Their organisations have done important work.  I particularly welcome the fact that both of them have not simply engaged with our committee but have also looked to the wider question of what we value in society and how we shape our priorities.<\/p> <p>  There are specific areas on which I would like to hear more discussion.  In Age Action's presentation, Ms Feely spoke about seeking an increase in the old age pension.  I presume she is also seeking that increase in the reduced rate pension.  I would like Ms Feely to comment specifically on that.  As we know, only 16% of those in receipt of the full contributory pension are women.  Ireland has a 37% gender pension gap.  I know Age Action has examined that matter and so I would like to hear Ms Feely's thoughts on the gender pension gap.<\/p> <p>  We rightly talked about lone parents, but when one changes conditionalities or thresholds, it is a cut or loss in income.  It means there is a real lack of an income they previously had.  We have seen an invisible cut of that kind, with a change of conditionality in pensions.  The change in thresholds for qualifying for reduced rate pensions has effectively meant a major loss of income for many older women.  I would like to hear Ms Feely's comments on that.  The committee would like to examine the gender pension gap, so the witnesses might like to suggest how we could press forward in that respect.<\/p> <p>  As regards proposals for home care, the submission contained detailed costings, including just over &euro;78 million to bring us to a point of adequacy for home care hours.  I can think of few things that represent such a crucial and strategic investment, more value for money, or that are more deeply necessary than bringing our home care up to an adequate standard.<\/p><p>It of course also delivers savings in the long term by allowing people to live with dignity in their own homes for far longer.  In addition to such necessary investment in home care, what are Ms Feely's thoughts on the idea of home care as a statutory entitlement, in line with the existing statutory entitlement for residential care, because I believe it may be necessary to consider this area?  I also welcome the joined-up approach highlighted by Age Action Ireland.  In that regard, Ms Feely mentioned Departments and I note Age Action Ireland is talking to other Departments as well as to this joint committee.  What does Ms Feely believe to be the current status of the national positive ageing strategy?  That was a strategy to which more than 1,000 older people gave of their time and energy.  I believe it was one of the most comprehensive consultations we ever have had and it has extended over two Governments.  It is a good strategy but its implementation is not evident.  Does Ms Feely believe re-engaging with the positive ageing strategy potentially could be a way to get some of that joined-up momentum she highlighted?  Others have spoken on fuel and as was mentioned, the Chairman also has interesting proposals in that regard.  I welcome that both the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Age Action Ireland have detailed and quite innovative and creative proposals on how to engage both with the payment thresholds and more innovative approaches to ensuring value and security for older people with regard to fuel.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, I congratulate it on the work it has done while recognising, as Senator Ardagh noted, it should not be obliged to step into the breach in many of the ways it has.  However, pulling back to the wider policy focus is important and it is particularly laudable that the society points to the key contradiction regarding the decision that must be made, which is that investment must be chosen over tax cuts.  In the context of some recent media discussion on the need for tax cuts for those on higher incomes, members must consider some of the testimonials given today.  How could they, in conscience, stand over any cuts to those on the higher third of incomes when people literally are making choices between the basic essentials of life?  We absolutely must look to investment over tax cuts and I welcome the society's framing of the issue in that way because this is the decision that must be placed at the centre and the priority that must be made.  Ms Fahey focused on and discussed income adequacy and before turning to the issue of lone parents, I note the society's sister organisation, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, has done interesting work on minimum essential standards of living.  It would be useful to hear some of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's thoughts on how it thinks constructive engagement with those minimum essential standards of living could be useful.  This could be in respect of the adequacy of payments but also perhaps with regard to income adequacy in other areas such as employment.<br\/><br\/>I compliment the Society of St. Vincent de Paul because it has given a strong and consistent focus over the past two to three years to the question of lone parents.  It has been highlighted and rings an alarm bell.  I must state that if we are to look at equality or gender-proofing of the budgetary process with any seriousness, addressing the issues faced by lone parents and the impact of poor policy decisions must be central.  Deputy O'Dea compared the current mess with <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland<\/i>but due to my affection for that book, I will use another analogy.  It is a patchwork and a maze which people and families are trying to put together on a week by week basis.  The real cuts and the real loss in income people have experienced because of the changes in conditionality are pushing people into hardship.  Ms Fahey described this in her testimonial and there are clear examples of hard choices between food and heating or between taking a bus to town and going to visit a doctor.  People are being asked to take different basic decisions, particularly those who are in receipt of the jobseeker's transitional payment or who have been pushed on to jobseeker's allowance.  Such hard choices then are echoed by the hard choices they must make between the patchwork of facilities available to them.  For example, I refer to the choice between the back-to-education allowance and the SUSI grant and the question - because of the rent supplement being there - as to whether a person will take a risk on rent supplement to access better supports for him or her when going back into college.<\/p><p>Will that person take that gamble?  We are asking people whose deprivation levels are such that they are already making hard choices to go without the essentials of life to make another set of hard choices.  These are the people who are seeking to go back into education and to train.  We should try to fix these anomalies.  We need an overall review of policy on lone parents.  We need to consider the substantially failed policy.  There are also very concrete cuts to income disregard which is a cash loss for parents.  That has been slightly but not fully restored.<\/p><p> I am particularly interested in the proposal on the jobseeker's transitional and the family income supplement because it would address some of the cases we have heard recently.  Why do the witnesses think it would be beneficial?  I have raised it with the Minister and the Department.  There seems to be a block.  They regard it almost as a double payment but it is not.  We want to keep an indicator within the system in order that somebody who manages to get a job is recognised as facing particular challenges in parenting alone with a child between the ages of seven and 14.  The invisibility of those parents' experience and the challenges they face has galled many women and many lone parents.  It is a way of ensuring the visibility of this group and the challenges and alarming levels of deprivation it faces.  I would like the witnesses to elaborate on that proposal because it is very timely and could be pushed forward in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#P00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming in.  Over many years, problems about the living alone allowance have been brought to me.  In one presentation we heard: \"Catherine told us, 'I cannot afford either life or home insurance.  I have to go to bed early to save on heating and electricity.  My husband passed away last year and I still have not paid off his funeral expenses.'\"<\/p> <p>  The living alone allowance is too small.  When somebody dies and only one pension is coming into a house, where before there was a couples&rsquo; pension of more than &euro;400, the amount is reduced to &euro;33.  When the Minister came to the Seanad he said he is considering this and he is going to increase the living alone allowance.  I would like to see it go up to a figure of almost &euro;300 but that may be fantasy.  It is a huge problem with all the extra charges brought in during the recession that people living alone cannot afford.  Heating and food are huge issues.<\/p> <p>  The bereavement grant and funeral grant have not worked out.  There is funding for them but in some cases the death had to be reported to the community welfare office before the funeral director.  The community welfare office got its own funeral company to deal with the funeral.  People who went ahead and did it themselves got no grant even though they could not afford to pay it.  That has to be reviewed.  There is money in the Department for this.  We should go back and some bereavement grant should be given.  The new formula has not worked but has put extra stress on many people.  The reduction of the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 put a lot of hardship on people.  I would like to see the new rate come in as well as the four weeks the witnesses have proposed.  A lump sum payment is a very good idea.<\/p> <p>  I would like Ms Fahey&rsquo;s opinion of school donations.  They can be from &euro;100 to &euro;200 per school.  There is intimidation in schools.  I know of one in my area which will not give a locker key unless &euro;100 is paid per child.<\/p><p>In another school in my area, a statement is sent out to those who have not paid the &euro;100 upfront and the parents can pay off the sum over a period.  I raised the issue at the Joint Committee of Education and Skills.  This practice is totally illegal.  The Department of Education and Skills does not encourage it but schools go ahead.  I am aware that some schools have sums ranging from &euro;50,000 to &euro;300,000 in a bank account for the running of the school.  I know schools can be underfunded at times.  I have no problem with the parents associations fund-raising to get money to provide for the children in their school.  However, demanding sums of either &euro;100 or &euro;200 per child from parents is extortion and is putting parents under serious financial pressure at a time when they have had to buy school shoes, school books and the uniform.  This is a serious issue and I would like groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to state that people cannot afford it.<\/p><p> At a previous meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, I requested that we establish the number of bank accounts that exist in schools and whether the Department of Education and Skills knows how many accounts exist, but it could not give me an answer.  I think it is a scandal that we do not know the number of school bank accounts and the amount of money involved.  Schools ask parents who can ill-afford more outgoings for a donation of &euro;100 or &euro;200 per child.<\/p><p> A major issue is increases in social protection payments.  In the past three to four years I have seen the impact of a small rise in a payment and how it can result in a person losing his or her medical card.  I agree that the Department of Social Protection will have to engage in a great deal more consultation when it comes to raising social protection payments or the old age pension.<\/p><p> The economy is growing and an increasing number of people are finding work but I see the rise in personal debt.  I am sure the witnesses are regularly getting through their doors people facing these difficulties.  People are being bullied and harassed by institutions.  They are becoming suicidal again.  People need a small loan for a washing machine or to cover the cost of getting the necessities to send children back to school.  I agree with the incentive the Minister has provided for credit unions to provide microfinance.  Microfinance is a great idea but many credit unions have not signed up to this initiative.  I would like to see them sign up.<\/p><p> Personal debt is a significant issue and I ask the witnesses to comment on whether the people they deal with are being harassed by institutions.  The Irish Credit Bureau was past its sell-by date during the crash.  We need to consider the system the Irish Credit Bureau has because it is past its sell-by date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#R00200","speaker":"1423","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Let me say well done to the representatives of Age Action Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

Ms Caroline Fahey is seeing that at first hand.<\/p> <p>  Working people are being driven into work poverty.<\/p><p>The matter is probably out of the remit of the witnesses and is more for legislators.  Many of the people in this country who are working, and probably earning the minimum wage, are struggling.  They do the best for their kids and for themselves but are punished all the time because of certain legislation introduced by political parties.  The narrative is as follows.  Since 2008, the social damage done by certain political parties is, to my eyes, criminal.  The collateral damage, a term I hate using, was outlined by the delegation.  It is unacceptable that people must struggle every day, beg and suffer.  This country is very wealthy but it is divided along class and financial lines.  Until that scenario is tackled, we will be debating these issues in ten years' time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#S00300","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I thank Ms. Fahey and Ms Feely for their presentations.  I will not repeat all the points that were made, but I will refer to one or two general issues.<\/p> <p>  Ms Feely said that \"research we are currently carrying out indicates tens of thousands of pensioners had their pensions drastically reduced following changes to the eligibility criteria for the contributory pension in 2012\".  Could she please tell me about the research, its scale, when it will be finalised and if she could make a copy of it available to us?  It is a very factual and interesting piece.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence but detailed research would prove useful.<\/p> <p>  Both witnesses mentioned fuel poverty and so forth.  In both presentations, reference was made to the fact that people face different challenges when trying to get value for money such in terms of an ability to switch online, e-billing and having enough regular money in one's bank account to pay by direct debit.  It seems to me that the people who are most in need get the worst value for money.  Increasing a weekly payment or the number of weeks is one method of improvement, but it is not the only one.  As I have said before, we need to be more innovative as a State in getting value for money.  It is the people who do not have access and, therefore, cannot carry out electronic switching or electronic billing or do not have enough money to pay by direct debt that get the worst value and the State is subsidising this situation.  The State should use its buying power to get maximum discount for individuals who have no opportunity of getting a discount.  The committee should look at this matter.  I am not saying we should replace the increase and period.  Instead, we should try to get far better value for the people who, when they are given the money, get less value than someone who has a bank account and, thus, can have a direct debit and carry out electronic switching.  It is the people who need help the most that get let less value from the money we are giving them and that is one of the challenges facing us.  <\/p> <p>  I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  A number of significant issues have been raised and both witnesses might like to comment.  Ms Feely opened proceedings at the beginning of this session so I will allow her to start and Ms Fahey might conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#T00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474968600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank members of the committee for their comprehensive comments and questions.  I hope to capture them all but if I do not then I ask members to remind me at the end.<\/p> <p>  I will first deal with fuel allowances.  I note that Deputies O'Dea and Brady and Senator Butler have said it is great idea to pay the fuel allowance in two lump sums.  We are glad to hear that the Department also thinks the suggestion is good.  We have discussed it at the pre-budget forum and the Minister seems to think it is a good idea.  Therefore, we need to implement the idea.  We are not sure how much the scheme costs.  It seems the payment will remain the same but the way it is delivered will change so one thinks minimal costs would be involved in implementing a system of two lump sums.  Obviously we do not know the Department's internal administrative arrangements.  I do not want to say the process will be cost neutral because I am sure it will cost a significant amount to set it up.  Time and again we have heard people say two lump sum payments is a good idea so let us make it a priority.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of fuel allowance, Deputy O'Dea asked how many people rely solely on the pension.<\/p><p>It is difficult to disaggregate the exact figure because such pensioners could have a small private pension for which they are getting quite a nominal amount.  We have a figure of 53,831 for those in receipt of the fuel allowance who are in receipt of the State pension non-contributory.  That is from the departmental statistics.  Each year the Department publishes its statistics.  The latest ones available are those for 2014.  One is talking about 53,831 out of a total of 95,000 recipients.  Of those on the State pension contributory, 69,000 are in receipt of the fuel allowance out of a total of 346,000.  All of those statistics are available in the Department's published statistics.<\/p><p> Ms Fahey probably has a number of points to make on the issue of fuel poverty and energy poverty because the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been to the forefront on this issue.  We have a strategy.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has published a strategy to address this issue, a critical component of which is a whole-of-government approach.  It is not only about tinkering around with the fuel allowance.  An innovative pilot programme in the strategy that I mentioned in my opening comments looks at a deep retrofitting of homes.  They have piloted this in parts of Dublin - I just cannot think of the postcode areas off the top of my head.  Its critical aim is to target those who already have respiratory conditions and they are trying to pitch it as being an investment in the houses of those who spend more time trying to access health services in an effort to make a saving across Departments.  That is the approach with which we need to be coming at this.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has a good approach in terms of fuel stamps, about which I am sure Ms Fahey can give more detail.<\/p><p> The other critical issue, in terms of addressing energy poverty, is trying to ensure that people are enabled to go online if they wish to so do and the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment supports this through a grant called BenefIT.  We have called for a continued increase in that funding and putting it on a multi-annual basis.  More than half of those over the age of 65 have never gone online.  Younger people would immediately go online to see what are the most cost-effective measures or fill out the switching forms but for older people, there is a greater challenge in this regard.  However, the number of those over the age 75 who have gone online is quite negligible, at approximately 3%.  There is a significant challenge but we need to be making those switching options more accessible to people.<\/p><p> The second contribution was from Deputy Brady.  One of the issues he raised - I probably covered the fuel allowance issues - is the transition pension and this is an important point.  One of the issues is we still have not abolished mandatory retirement rates and if one is in the public service or perhaps under other contracts, one must retire upon reaching the age of 65.  Last year we welcomed the opportunity to present on this issue at the Department of Justice and Equality.  Former Deputy Anne Ferris brought forward a good Bill on this and there was almost cross-party support to abolish mandatory retirement.  Obviously, with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il, that has not gone forward and I am not really sure where it is in the system.  However, the issue is that there has been considerable support for it.  One gets somebody who, maybe at the age of 65, is forced to retire but cannot access the State pension and the person finds him or herself accessing jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  While the Department has been quite relaxed in terms of the activation measures around that, such persons find themselves, maybe for the first time in their lives, in a dole office which can be unsettling when they are coming to a point in their life where they want to retire.  We have done some work on that and we can certainly provide the committee with our policy position on it.  We have a document that we can submit.<\/p><p> The other issue Deputy Brady, and Senator Butler, brought up was the bereavement grant.  We have called for its reinstatement at a cost of &euro;20 million.  In terms of the community welfare officer, CWO, it is not something about which I would have direct contact with a CWO but there is a variance across the country.  I suppose it is dependent on the CWO in one's area.<\/p><p>With regard to Senator Ardagh's comments on Age Action Ireland, we do not provide individual support to older people in the same way the Society of St. Vincent de Paul does.  We do not give people monetary payments, but we have a service called care and repair for older people who would be less likely to be able to change a light bulb or something like that.  We provide a free service involving small do-it-yourself jobs such as cutting their grass, putting up Christmas decorations and other jobs that become increasingly difficult while we age.  We have figures on that and also on the number of calls to our information line looking for information.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Collins raised the eligibility criteria for the one-parent family payment.  That is linked to Senator Higgins' point on the gender pension gap, which is an issue I had wanted to discuss.  It concerns the research we have conducted on which Deputy Curran<b><\/b>asked us to respond.  In terms of what we have done, in 2012 the eligibility criteria for the pension was changed in that where originally we had four bands, that increased to six bands.  Getting the top rate of payment, therefore, becomes increasingly difficult.  The first band remained unchanged but the second band was divided into three.  With regard to bands 5 and 6, the weekly amount is less.<br\/><br\/>What is interesting about that and how it relates to the point Senator Higgins made on the gender differences in that we see a disproportionate impact on older people, in the statistical information I mentioned when addressing Deputy O'Dea there are global figures on the number of pensions, but as we drill down into access to pensions, we can see the gender dimensions.  For example, there is a fairly even gender break, at 50:50, with regard to overall pensions for people over the age of 65.  With regard to the contributory pension, however, two thirds are male and one third is female.  When we look at the non-contributory pension, two thirds are female and one third are male.  We can see that women are less likely to be recipients of the contributory pension to which one contributes throughout one's life.  When we drill down further, however, and examined the changes, and who has been in receipt of the top bands, we see that in the top band of payment where people get &euro;233 per week, 73% are male and 27% are women.  If we drill down further we see that in the second one, 78% are male and 22% are women, but immediately we see a reversal.  For band 3, which is 30 to 39 annual contributions, we see that 43% are men and 57% are women.  Women are predominantly in the lower bands of the pension rate but the major issue we have with the 2012 changes is that they substantially reduced the weekly rate to which they are entitled.<br\/><br\/>In our research we undertook to contact the Department to get some statistics from it.  We also tried to capture the lived experience of women and men who are impacted by this change and we found that the reduction they would face during their lifetime could be up to &euro;20,000.  We reckon that approximately 36,000 have been impacted by this change, 38% of whom are men and 62% of whom are women.<br\/><br\/>We are at the final stage of drafting this report.  It has gone to two external reviewers.  We were hoping it would be available in the coming weeks.  We are happy to provide the committee with a copy of the report.  We would also be happy to attend the committee to discuss it with the members.<br\/><br\/>The other issue that was raised was the living alone allowance.  A critical point about that is that it is negatively impacting on women.  Women are more likely to live alone.  We can see in the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice research that women on a non-contributory pension who are living alone will face a &euro;9 weekly deficit.  Those on the contributory pension have a surplus of less than &euro;1.  However, to go back to my previous point, that is assuming they are on the top rate of the contributory pension but as we can see, the way things are falling out, women are less likely to be on that.  How do we address that issue?  I believe we need to take a life course approach to addressing that.  It is about addressing the pension issue, but it is also about addressing the issue of care across the life cycle.  In terms of those impacted by the 2012 changes, we are talking about people who were born between 1946 and 1950.<\/p><p>They would have got married in the early 1970s and would have been subject to the legal obligation to retire upon marriage, as per the marriage bar, if they were working in the public sector or there would have been cultural expectations that they would stay at home.  Therefore, they would have exited the workplace.  They may have worked before they got married and when their children grew up they may have returned to work but, invariably, they returned to work prior to 1996 when the credits under the homemaker's scheme were introduced.  Those women are not able to take up credits under that scheme as a means to reach the top contributions.  This is an issue we have increasingly become aware of through our members and we will publish our research on this in the next month or two.<\/p><p> Senator Higgins raised the issues of home care and the national positive ageing strategy, and I will respond to both of those together.  While we have the national positive ageing strategy, we do not have an implementation plan for it.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, held a meeting of older people's organisations, at which Age Action was represented by our chief executive office, CEO, to discuss where we should we go in terms of taking action on it.  There is an implementation deficit here, although when I attend other events across the community and voluntary sector I find that it is not unique to the national positive ageing strategy.  There is an implementation deficit in terms of policy across Government.<\/p><p> There is a commitment in the national positive ageing strategy to enable people to age in place.  That is not something new.  It has been enshrined in policy since the late 1960s.  We have put forward that people should be enabled to age at home.  If we consider the funding of the nursing homes support scheme, which puts access to long-term and residential care on a statutory footing, for every &euro;1 that we pay on home care, we invest &euro;276 in residential care.  I have a copy of the research on this area that we published and I would be happy to forward it to the committee.  Earlier this year we found that 50% of people who were residing in nursing homes did not need to be there.  We need adopt a value for money approach in this respect.  Under a programme in the United Kingdom, they invested in giving people low to medium supports within the home and this resulted in savings in hospital bed hours and in the number of times people accessed accident and emergency departments.  That is contained in our submission to the Department of Health, which I can forward to the committee.<\/p><p> To return to the pensions issue, we need to consider proofing budgets, whether it be equality proofing or examining matters in a more holistic and consistent way.  Decisions are made that seem to have the impact of making departmental savings but we need to examine their impact on specific groups.  The 2012 changes in eligibility criteria for pensions have had a disproportionate impact on women.  We now have a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the issue of equality and gender proofing, and we need to set up that infrastructure to ensure that when we have these discussions, decisions are made in the round and on the basis of having the least adverse impact on vulnerable groups.  I hope I have answered all the questions that were put to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Naomi Feely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feely for her response.

I will start by responding to the questions on the one-parent family payment and the issues that arise in that respect.  Senator Ardagh asked what we would prioritise or how we can prevent the changes that have happened with the one-parent family payment from having such a negative impact.<\/p><p>Mothers' educational attainment is certainly a strong predictor of how well families and children do.  We suggest that the negative things which have come about as a result of the reform of the one-parent family payment, and have made it more difficult for lone parents to take up education and training, should be tackled at the outset.  For example, there is a need to ensure that the maintenance grant is reasonable and to allow people to access it.  People who are thinking about taking up education and training opportunities need to be assured that child care assistance will be available to them, that their income will enable them to make ends meet and that their housing entitlements will not be put at risk.  Such matters are important.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the risks that people are being asked to take.  We have noticed that people on low incomes can be very risk-averse because they do not have the background resources to make up the shortfall if things fall apart or do not work out.  This is especially relevant in the case of education.  Some people can be reluctant to send their children to third-level education because it is such a huge expense.  It can be hard for them to overcome barriers like their lack of familiarity with third-level education and their fear that they will be much worse off if it does not work out.  It is a big problem.<\/p><p> We have spoken to the Department about what is preventing the family income supplement and jobseeker's transition payment from being made together.  It would not be that expensive to implement such a system, which would make a significant difference to lone parents in employment with children under the age of 14 who require child care.  The Department is quite keen to ensure that nobody is getting two social welfare payments at the same time.  There are also concerns that people might see large decreases in their incomes when their circumstances change and they are no longer parenting alone.  We would always argue that people on low incomes who are parenting alone are special cases because they face numerous challenges.  Many people are managing to work while rearing children on their own on low incomes.  We are going to keep pushing this one even though certain arguments are being made against it.  Some people would argue that a family in work on family income supplement is not technically experiencing poverty.  This argument is based on the definitions of poverty, etc.  We know that many families in work on low incomes are struggling.<\/p><p> During our discussions with lone parents, it has been suggested to us that the work of parenting itself is not recognised.  This situation applies to lone parents only because couple households can often choose to have one parent staying at home.  I accept that such households can have financial difficulties.  The rules that allow married couples to transfer their tax credits and the standard rate band facilitate one parent in staying at home.  If one is parenting alone, however, one is told one has to go out and work.  It is a kind of contradiction.  Many lone parents feel that the work they are doing in raising children by themselves was not recognised when certain reforms were made.<\/p><p> Two things have repeatedly come up in the Vincentian Partnership for Justice's research work on how much it costs to have a minimum essential standard of living.  Housing and child care costs are driving up the high cost of being able to make ends meet.  Social welfare payments certainly fall far below what is needed.  In many cases, employment income is not enough because of the high costs I have mentioned.  A job will not always help one to come out of poverty or to have a decent standard of living.  This is a concern for us because employment is being promoted as the solution to child poverty and to poverty generally - as the only game in town.  Certainly, there are much lower rates of poverty in households where people are in employment, but there is an awful lot of in-work poverty as well.  Many people who are working are struggling because they qualify for nothing and they pay for everything.  It is becoming a huge issue for people on low incomes to be able to afford to meet their housing costs.  We need to tackle the high cost of housing and the lack of availability of proper social housing.  When we speak about social housing, we are talking about housing provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies rather than housing provided through rent supplement and housing assistance payments, etc.  We do not believe the latter form of social housing gives people secure tenure.<\/p><p> Tackling the cost of housing and child care would make a huge difference to the families we are assisting.  While we welcomed the increase in rent supplement and housing assistance payments, we are finding that the homelessness issue and the problem of people not being able to afford housing is moving further out of Dublin.  We have members in Wexford and Waterford who are talking about homeless families being accommodated in one bed and breakfast for five days of the week, being shipped out to another bed and breakfast for the weekend and then being shipped back to the original bed and breakfast for five days again.  These difficult situations are not confined to Dublin.  The problem is moving out now because people cannot afford Dublin at all.<\/p><p> The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is stepping into the breach by providing services that might previously have been provided through community welfare officers or through State services generally.  When we speak to lone parents who are being assisted by the society, we are told that regardless of how good or how sensitive a charity's volunteers might be, having to go to a charity to ask for help is a very negative experience.<\/p><p>Having to tell a volunteer that there is not enough money for food for the week or to put a uniform on a child is extraordinarily difficult.  We are stepping into the breach but it is not good for a person's dignity or self-respect.  Even though we do a good job in many cases, it is not a positive thing.<\/p><p> We do not have an exact breakdown of our spend compared to what is spent under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  However, we have noticed that while the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive used to spend &euro;80 million on supplementary welfare, the figure is approximately &euro;30 million per year now.  Our spend has gone up in the corresponding time.  We help with largely the same problems, including basic things for people, for example, household furniture, things for children and so on.  We believe there is a relationship between the decrease in the expenditure of those organisations and the increase in ours.<\/p><p> I will offer a comment on education.  I did a piece on \"The Pat Kenny Show\" yesterday about crested uniforms.  In primary school, a crested jumper costs &euro;30 and a crested tracksuit is a further &euro;30.  A child might need two jumpers.  This means &euro;90 is gone out of the &euro;100 back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance before a pair of runners, shoes or a winter coat has been bought.  The back-to-school costs are exorbitant for many parents.  There is a real need to engage with parents more to see how the costs could be reduced.  We are looking for practical solutions to reduce these costs.  Voluntary contributions put extraordinary pressure on families as well.  We spend a little under &euro;5 million per year on education.  Approximately half of that goes towards third-level education costs, while 20% of the costs go on primary school and 20% on secondary school.  The remainder is spent on early education and so on.  In primary and secondary schools, voluntary contributions are the principal concern, followed by school books and then school uniforms.  These are the costs families are struggling with and they come to us for help with them.  We end up spending approximately &euro;5 million per year on them.<\/p><p> The energy end of things has been well covered.  We have a pilot oil stamp saving scheme.  The lump sum payment for oil does not work for people of working age.  The Department can argue that it could pay someone a lump sum but that if that person got a job or was no longer parenting alone, then he or she would no longer be eligible for the fuel allowance.  We are looking for other solutions for people of working age.  We have the oil savings stamp scheme running on a pilot basis.  People can pay their fuel allowance into it and build up a lump sum.  We need more innovative creative ways around some of the problems facing people.  As well as that, some of our Society of St. Vincent de Paul local conferences work with fuel providers to negotiate a group discount.  They can arrange for an oil delivery to four or five families at the one time.  This overcomes the problem of having a minimum fill that some households cannot afford.<\/p><p> Reference was made to debt and financial inclusion in the credit unions scheme.  It is a pity that not all credit unions are using it.  One of the difficulties is that sometimes the credit unions in the most disadvantaged areas are not implementing it.  One reason for this is that because so many of their clients would qualify for it, the relevant credit unions reckon they do not have the resources to provide the loans.  It is a contradictory thing.  The scheme is almost a victim of its own success.  There has been extensive positive feedback about it and many people want to take out the loans but they are not always available, and that is a real shame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016092700002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Fahey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474968600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their comprehensive replies to the significant issues raised.
