The overall aim of the strategy is to develop a world-class integrated system of further education and training in Ireland which will promote economic development and meet the needs of all citizens.  The strategy was developed by SOLAS, the further education and training authority, which was established in 2013 to develop and give strategic direction to the further education sector.<br\/>To brief the committee on the strategy and how it is being taken forward, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Paul O'Toole, Ms Fiona Hartley and Dr. Bryan Fields representing SOLAS, the further education and training authority, Mr. Michael Moriarty and Mr. Paddy Lavelle representing Education and Training Boards Ireland, Dr. Kara McGann representing IBEC and Dr. Peter Rigney representing ICTU.

We look forward to contributing to the committee's discussion and addressing any questions that members may have about the role of SOLAS in the implementation of this strategy.  SOLAS was established in October 2013 on foot of the Further Education and Training Act 2013, section 9 of which provides that SOLAS will prepare and submit a strategy in respect of further education and training to the Minister for Education and Skills every five years.  The Minister may approve the strategy with or without modifications, or may refuse to approve the strategy.  The first such strategy was submitted for consideration to the then Minister on 31 March 2014 in accordance with the agreed timeline for this initial proposed strategy.  The Minister formally approved the strategy on 24 April 2014.<\/p><p>  SOLAS is tasked with ensuring the provision of high-quality further education and training programmes which are responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changed and changing economy.  This mandate will be delivered in conjunction with all of our partners, particularly the education and training boards, which are our principal partners.  For the purposes of the strategy, further education and training programmes are defined as comprehending up to level 6 of the national framework of qualifications and where funding is provided by SOLAS through the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills.  These programmes embrace a vast range of courses which provide entry level, intermediate and technical skills as well as programmes which assist in personal development and support people who suffer various forms of disadvantage or disability.  Apprenticeships are an example of effective further education and training provision.  I am aware that the committee has examined the future approach to this aspect of provision.<\/p><p>  The strategy provides a focus for the setting of further education and training investment priorities and a framework for the establishment and development of a strong further education and training sector.  It aims to deliver a higher quality learning experience, leading to better outcomes for everyone who engages in further education and training.  In turn, this will support economic development and increase social inclusion.  SOLAS consulted widely with stakeholders in developing the strategy, which is set in the context of Government reform of public services.  This consultation included representatives from employer bodies, higher and further education and training providers, community and other representative bodies, trade unions and, vitally, learners themselves.  An evidence-based approach was applied though collaboration with the ESRI, which has carried out extensive research nationally and internationally.  This research has been published by the ESRI in a companion document, Further Education and Training in Ireland: Past, Present and Future.<\/p><p>  Strategic goals have been identified for the further education and training sector in five areas: skills for the economy, active inclusion, quality provision, integrated planning and funding, and the standing of further education and training.  The goal under the heading of skills for the economy is that further education and training will address the current and future skills needs of learners, jobseekers and employees, meet the skills needs of enterprise and employers and contribute to national economic development.  The goal under the heading of active inclusion is that further education and training provision will support the active inclusion of people of all abilities in society, with special reference to literacy and numeracy in accordance with the legislation which established SOLAS.  The goal under the heading of quality provision is that further education and training will provide high-quality education and training programmes and will meet appropriate national and international quality standards.  The goal under the heading of integrated planning and funding is that further education and training provision will be planned and funded on the basis of objective needs and evidence of social and economic impact.  The goal under the heading of the standing of further education and training is to ensure a valued learning path leading to agreed employment, career, developmental, personal and social outcomes.<\/p><p>  Following the approval of the strategy by the Minister of Education and Skills, a detailed whole-of-sector implementation plan that sets out over 50 actions required to implement the strategy has been developed in consultation with the Departments of Education and Skills; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and Social Protection.  SOLAS will lead on more than 50% of the actions which have been identified and the balance will be led by a number of Departments and other bodies.  A large number of stakeholder organisations are being asked to contribute to the achievement of each action as appropriate.  A new strategy implementation advisory committee has been established to review progress on the implementation of the strategy and provide advice to SOLAS.  It is being chaired by the Department of Education and Skills and its membership includes representatives of each main group of delivery stakeholders.  A mechanism to ensure the voice of learners is heard is being developed and will be implemented to ensure this vital group of stakeholders will have an opportunity to participate in the evolution of the further and education sector.<\/p><p>  SOLAS will report progress on a quarterly basis to its board, to the Minister for Education and Skills and publicly.  SOLAS acknowledges the fine work carried out by many providers in the development and evolution of the further education and training sector over many years.  We believe these providers and the existing provision form a solid basis to move forward.  Nevertheless, the objective evidence which is available points to the need to refocus and reinvigorate the sector.  Further education and training programmes give many people, most of whom are adults, an opportunity to develop their potential in a manner which best supports the achievement of their personal learning goals and their preferred approach to learning.  A coherent plan that seeks to synergise the many strands which encompass further education and training today has an ethos of continuous improvement and is based on objective, non-partisan evaluation of how individual further education and training programmes achieve against their stated objectives, deliver better outcomes and experiences for learners and significantly enhance the contribution of further education and training to the economy and society.  The principal challenge for all the stakeholders in further education and training is to drive forward the implementation of this strategy.  A sea change is required in how we value, promote, deliver, assess and continually improve further education and training programmes.  SOLAS intends to play a full and constructive part in this implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1415797500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Michael Moriarty of Education and Training Boards Ireland to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415797500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>As the Chairman and the members of the committee will be aware, the intention behind the establishment of the education and training boards and SOLAS in 2013 was to provide for better co-ordination and delivery of education and training, leading to the development of a world-class integrated system of further education and training in Ireland.  Under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, the role of each education and training board is to \"plan, provide, co-ordinate and review the provision of education and training ... in its functional area\".  As we have heard, the role of SOLAS is to have responsibility for the strategic co-ordination and funding of the further education and training sector.  The further education and training strategy that was mentioned by Mr. O'Toole, which was published in May 2014, provides a roadmap for this process.  As the main statutory authorities delivering further education and training, education and training boards and their representative body, Education and Training Boards Ireland, have significant roles to play in realising that strategy.<\/p><p>  A key part of the successful implementation of the strategy will be the provision of the capacity and resources to manage the delivery of training and education efficiently.  If the strategy is to fulfil its mission, education and training boards need appropriate structures and supports and adequate resourcing.  The detailed implementation plan for the further education and training strategy sets out how the education and training boards will assist in the fulfilment of the goals identified in that strategy.  I would like to mention some of the 13 actions, from the total of 53 identified in the plan, that relate to Education and Training Boards Ireland and the education and training boards themselves.  We will be responsible for modifying further education and training provision in accordance with the skills needs of industry; reflecting direct employer involvement in designing courses; providing education and training in entrepreneurship, which is something we hope to do next year; developing appropriate further education and training interventions and supports for active inclusion; ensuring an effective support service that identifies education and training needs and matches them to the needs of industry is available for all learners who need it; developing a co-ordinated programme of continuing professional development; developing a further education and training customer charter; ensuring there is effective continuing professional development; developing partnerships with further education support services, curriculum development units and other agencies and bodies locally and nationally; and devising and implementing an integrated guidance strategy in association with SOLAS.<\/p><p>  Education and Training Boards Ireland has identified a number of concerns regarding possible impediments or roadblocks to the achievement of these actions.  While I am sure these issues will be addressed, it is important to place details of them on the record.  A strategy is needed to address salary scales and career structure development for the tutors who deliver further education.  They need a proper career structure in this sector.  The further education and training sector now stands shoulder to shoulder with the first, second and third level sectors, but it needs the same focus.  It needs to be professionalised.  The professionalisation of the role of tutors is one of the key ways of doing this.  This sector also needs a capital budget for building improvement works, as it is the only one of the four sectors I mentioned that does not have such a budget.  While the recruitment moratorium does not affect front-line services, it certainly affects the support staff we have.  That is critical, as is the guidance strategy.  A proper, effective and well-resourced adult guidance service needs to be in place to make sure the most marginalised people, including those in the most difficult circumstances and the long-term unemployed, are directed in the right direction in terms of their future skills needs.<\/p><p>  One of the means by which SOLAS supports the delivery of integrated further education and training by the education and training boards is by allocating funding to those boards.<\/p> <p>This funding includes the cost of running the former training centres which have transferred to the ETBs which are constituted from the old VECs and the F&Aacute;S training division.  They are providing integration of further education and training at local level within the catchment area.  This is a significant advantage in terms of customer identification with education and training boards.<\/p><p> We continue to hold high-level meetings with our colleagues in SOLAS and there is a collaborative approach at national level in respect of the implementation plan for the further education and training strategy.  The putting in place of funding agreements ensures that ETBs retain ownership over their own local planning but within national guidelines while ensuring there is consistency in quality across the regions.<\/p><p> Underpinning the further education and training, FET, strategy is a commitment by ETBs and SOLAS to establishing an appropriate advisory infrastructure so that provision is informed directly by employers and responds to emerging needs at both national and local level as well as a commitment to develop and provide new courses and programmes that are quality assured and adhere to the relevant awarding body quality system.  There is also a commitment to advance the recommendations of the apprenticeship review and to establish new models of work-based learning within further education and training, FET.  Education and Training Board Ireland, ETBI and ETBs will continue to collaborate with SOLAS to achieve the aims of the FET strategy and to advance the actions listed in the implementation plan.  However, it is imperative that adequate resourcing and funding are put in place to allow ETBs to fulfil both those commitments and their mandate as set out in the Further Education and Training Boards Act 2013.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I thank the members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the provisions contained in the FET strategy in which ETBI and our member ETBs are centrally involved.   My colleague and I will be happy to respond to questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415798100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on an important issue for the business sector.  IBEC is pleased to have been a member of both the further education and training strategy advisory group and the group that is currently overseeing its implementation.  Therefore, we are very familiar with the detailed planning that has gone into the development of the strategy.  We also the welcome the commitment of the strategy's architects, notably SOLAS, to engage with business.<\/p><p>  This is an extremely ambitious and challenging strategy that seeks to rebuild the entire further education and training sector.  It gives priority, quite correctly in our view, to the requirement to provide people with the skills and education to enable them to compete for sustainable work.  However, its success will be ultimately judged by how it delivers.  All too often, the reconfiguration of institutions and policy rhetoric at national level bear little relationship to what is happening on the ground.  We need to be realistic about the significant implementation challenges.  This is a complex and diverse sector that has not, it is generally agreed, received the attention it deserves from policymakers in the past.  We are unable to comment in detail on a 158-page strategy document in a five minute input.  Therefore, I will highlight where we believe the most significant challenges exist from a business perspective.<\/p><p>  The strategy quite correctly emphasises the importance of aligning further education and training with the skills needs of employers.  Local labour market demand is more likely to be anticipated through intensive interaction between education training providers and the enterprise.  As the OECD has pointed out, there is an inevitable tendency for vocational programmes rooted in education institutions to develop their own dynamic, independent of the world of work and unresponsive to rapid change in the needs of the economy.  To ensure that the FET system is not supply driven, it is critical that the business community is strongly represented at both national and, more particularly, at local level.<\/p><p>  Apart from the local labour market intelligence which employers bring, they can also provide a specific perspective on the type of employability skills that can be developed through the curriculum.  For example, in recruiting unemployed people for entry level positions we know that employers want evidence that candidates have the aptitudes and soft skills that will enable them to learn what their job entails, adapt to the company's organisational culture and get on with colleagues.  However, we should not underestimate the complexities and challenges of connecting with a highly heterogeneous business sector in which almost 47% of total employment is provided by firms with fewer than 50 employees.  This is a business environment that is constantly changing.  In order to engage meaningfully, we need integrated regional structures which bring together employers, FET, higher education, enterprise development agencies and the local Intreo service.<\/p><p>  IBEC is constantly struck by how the different components of our education system work in silos.  FET has a critical function in providing access and progression routes for individuals to continue their studies at institutes of technology or universities.  The committee will be aware that the Higher Education Authority is also working on the development of regional clusters of different types of education institutions.  The clusters have the potential to play a key role in the development of industry networks and to provide clear regional pathways for individuals who want to progress through the education system, but we do not hear the voice of further education and training sufficiently in these discussions.  Given the economic circumstances, it is not surprising that a lot of attention in the development of the strategy was on the relationship between FET and labour market activation.  However, the sector has a critical role in meeting the needs of people in employment.<\/p><p>  Ireland's economic recovery depends on the skills and flexibility of its labour market.  There is a particularly important cohort of individuals currently in employment which is precarious or where skills are becoming obsolete.  They also require upskilling or retraining if they are to retain their jobs and their employer is to remain viable or competitive.  It is important that provision is made for them.  To meet the needs of diverse learners with diverse schedules it is important that a range of programme delivery methods are offered.  This will offer benefits in terms of costs and flexibility of access, but will also require significant preparation in advance by those delivering the programmes.  As important is the flexibility around when courses are delivered and examined it does not always suit to have strict adherence to an academic year and so flexibility is also required in this regard.<\/p><p>  Last July, IBEC provided evidence to the joint committee on the new apprenticeship model.  At the time we referred to the reality that apprenticeships and vocational education in general do not enjoy the parity of esteem in a society that defines educational achievement in terms of CAO points.  This strategy offers an opportunity to address this challenge.  Its successful implementation will enable FET providers to equip learners with the necessary skills to take up sustainable, high quality and fulfilling employment.  In this way, it will become a highly sought-after education option for both young people and adult learners.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC's views on this important initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kara McGann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415798100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation.  Like my colleague from IBEC, I made a presentation last July on the question of apprenticeships.  In ICTU's view, one of the key components of the strategy would be the development of a broadened and modern apprenticeship model for our economy.  This is the responsibility of the newly established apprenticeship advisory council which will be launched next week.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that we have just emerged from our first European semester since our exit from the troika and we have received a recommendation on the development of a modernised apprenticeship system.  I suspect we will be given a recommendation along these lines in the country-specific recommendations for next year.  At European level, the EU Council has called for open pathways and parity of esteem between vocational education and training and general higher education.  This call is articulated in the Copenhagen declaration and is based on research conducted over a decade by CEDEFOP, the European Centre for Research and Vocational Training.  Many of the issues we face in Ireland are in fact Europe-wide issues.<\/p><p>  The priorities of the further education sector in Ireland must reflect the priorities of the ESF which is one of the major sources of funding.  These priorities are, first, to combat long-term unemployment by ensuring that individuals can access employment via in-demand skills development, together with improving the qualification levels of lower skilled longer-term unemployed; second, to support those young people not in education, employment or training, NEETs, to participate in programmes which include work experience with labour market relevance; and, third, to increase social inclusion by targeting interventions with appropriate ongoing supports.  These are reflected in the three drivers of training developed by SOLAS which are the labour market, social inclusion and lifelong learning.<\/p><p>  I was a member of the committee that helped to draw up the SOLAS training strategy and I am fully committed to it as part of what I consider to be collective responsibility.  Each of the three areas I mentioned will have differing metrics, reflecting the divergent needs of their client populations.  One of the first tasks of SOLAS has been to put credible metrics in place, in co-operation with all the stakeholders.<\/p><p>  As other speakers said, the further education sector now represents the ETBs and the F&Aacute;S training centres and in our view, it should absorb what is best in both bodies and cultures in terms of corporate culture and operational models.  A key aspect of the system which is being developed must be the development of work-based learning including the development of tools for monitoring the work-based element of the learning.  This will need to go beyond the informality which surrounds much of education-based work experience.  Perhaps part of the price we pay for a modern quality apprenticeship system is a lessening of the requirement for work experience in other areas of the education system, lessening the requirement on employers in exchange for the rolling out of apprenticeships in other areas.<\/p><p>  It has frequently been said that SOLAS will be to the ETBs what the HEA is to the universities and the institutes of technology.  We agree that there is a need for a national body to steer a national policy.  One of the strongest aspects that SOLAS brings to bear is its evaluative skills and its skills in labour market forecasting contained in its skills and labour market research unit.  One of the key issues for the sector in the future will be labour market contact and labour market relevance.<\/p> <p>An underpinning value of further education must be the credibility of the awards.  Awards are like currency; they are pieces of paper which, of themselves, are intrinsically worthless but on which society conveys a worth by virtue of what they signify.  Citizens must be certain that the standards set by QQI are consistent.  We must also be satisfied that when problems arise, as they have done in the past, they are fully examined and lessons are learned.<br\/>As stated, a problem faced in the further education sector is one of parity of esteem.  This has been identified at European level.  Frankly and simply put, this means some FE courses are not regarded as highly as higher education courses, even though the FE courses concerned might have better completion rates and employment outcomes than the HE courses.  The challenge for Ireland is to overcome this problem of perception and to name and challenge the organisational behaviour which fosters this perception.<br\/>If there is one thing I want to stress in my presentation, it is that the overwhelming issue for us is the development of a modernised apprenticeship system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415798700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today to discuss the strategy.  I have a few comments on which I would like them to come back.  Everybody touched on the importance of ensuring the further education sector is matched in relation to the employment side of its objectives to ensure it meets future demand.  On the apprenticeship side, the most recent figures show that between painters-decorators and bricklayers, there was a total of ten apprentices in the system and we expect that sector to grow over the coming years.  It is relevant to the apprenticeship strategy but it signifies the difficulties in the system in terms of ensuring it meets future demand and that it is not constantly trying to play catch up.  I would be interested to hear any further comments from the witnesses in relation to how they believe the further education strategy for the next five years, as published, can do that and what are the chances we can ensure it will work in a way that ensures it meets demand as opposed to being driven by supply, as was the case in the past.<\/p><p>  There was a two point increase in the previous budget in the pupil-teacher ratio in the further education sector.  I would be interested to hear feedback from the witnesses on any feedback they have had from within the sector as to the impact it has had and whether that is something which needs to be addressed to ensure the five year strategy can meet its objectives.<\/p><p>  Mr. Moriarty mentioned the issue of guidance.  I would be interested to hear the views of all the witnesses in relation to the importance of proper guidance and on people entering the system and on ensuring people take up courses and go down avenues which appropriately meet their needs.  There are big gaps in the system and if the new strategy is to work properly, it cannot be done without a proper guidance provision system.  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on the adequacy of the current set up and what exactly we require to complement the objectives of the strategy.<\/p><p>  I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses from SOLAS and ETBI on the amalgamation of the training centres with the ETBI, on how that is going and if there are challenges there which remain to be met and how that fits into the achievement of the strategy's objectives.

It is an ambitious programme and, with any ambitious programme, there is a need for not only for a shift in terms of people's attitudes, but for investment.  One of the investments, for instance, deals with the requirements of business and the STEM subjects if we are to provide the best possible opportunity and education for those who are availing of courses.  Are the witnesses confident that the resources are there?  What are the resources required to bring all of the centres and courses, in particular, the STEM courses, that have been identified up to a level comparable with international standards?  That is in terms of resources for labs and so on.<\/p><p>  There is also a resource issue in terms of teachers.  Deputy McConalogue mentioned the PLCs.  There has been a drop-off in numbers because of the pupil-teacher ratio.  If we are to deliver the best possible opportunity, there is a requirement that classes are not too full and that those being trained or taught get the best possible outcome from the course of which they are availing rather than being in overloaded classes, which is a factor in the rest of the education system.  What is happening in relation to delivering courses, which are not oversubscribed?  I know of some colleges which have taken on extra pupils over and above the numbers required to ensure that the colleges can survive. <\/p><p>  I refer to the change from F&Aacute;S centres to education and training board centres.  I do not think utilisation of many of the centres is at its fullest.  We have centres which have fully fitted out training rooms for electricians, plumbers and so on.  I tabled parliamentary questions recently and found some have been vacant for a long time.  One of the questions I asked was about a course I was promised was due to start, which leads me on to a follow up question.  Will the courses be delivered by directly employed trainers from the ETBs or will they be subcontracted out?  There is a danger that a course could be subcontracted out to an organisation which is for profit rather than for education and that there would be difference in the ethos and possibly the outcome.  <\/p><p>  The question of the move towards working all year round would be a major one for Dr. Rigney, who represents ICTU, which would include the TUI and other unions.  What is the current position?  Have there been negotiations with the unions, the teachers and the trainers or is it just one of those ideas put out which, all of a sudden, ends up on top of us very quickly without the background work being done?  It would be a huge change for some teachers, although others are trainers and work all year round anyway.  If we amalgamate both sectors, there will be major difficulties, including human resource difficulties, union difficulties and difficulties for people who have had a different holiday arrangements, etc., and who would have to change their lives to cater for children and so on.

Here we have approximately 25, many of which are related to the construction area.  In what direction do the delegates intend to expand apprenticeships beyond construction, plumbing and electrical work?  I do not see lists of these.  There have been many reports, including from the Forestry Service of Ireland and heritage and conservation bodies.  There have been many suggestions on apprenticeships.  Have any of those come to the fore?  Are any apprenticeships being expanded or put into place?  There is a lot more to be done than just electrical work and plumbing, which of course are terribly important.

The idea that the BA is the only way forward in education is crazy.  People need skills and want to be able to do things; it is not that a BA does not allow one to do things.  The vocational education sector was the first sector in which I taught as a teacher.  Vocational education is a marvellous method of education but we seem to have lost it along the way towards academic education.  We have heard many people stating they just want to get to university but sometimes vocational education is appropriate.  Vocational education is now returning as a means of training young people, especially those who have been unemployed for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200006#G00400","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415799300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad so I will allow the delegates to respond immediately.

One of the first acts of the group will be a call to enterprise to put forward its suggestions on where it can usefully provide apprenticeship-type opportunities.<\/p><p>  To get to the heart of the Senator's question, people learn in different ways.  In the broadest sense, further education and training recognises that people start from different places and can best develop their potential if supported to do so in the right way.  The system works when a person can learn required skills on the job in the work environment, supported by State investment in the formal aspects of the training or education.  In the broadest sense, that is what the new apprenticeship council will seek to do.  There is an existing range of 25 apprenticeships, which have been very successful down the years.  There will be a call to expand that.<\/p><p>  Apprenticeship in Ireland represents a statutorily based function and is defined as such.  It is interpreted differently in different countries around Europe, and we know that.  We have developed a range of traineeships that have the feature of on-the-job learning, supported by State off-the-job learning.  There is a range of other disciplines, including secretaryships.  To get the core of the point, there is an opportunity associated with, and a value attached to, increasing the range of combined dual-approach learning programmes on and off the job.  We expect that the new call to action in this regard will yield benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1415799300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>There were 76 submissions to the former Minister from sectors all over Ireland, including the forestry and conservation sectors, and also those associated with electronics, tax and business.

The two central planks of the further education and training strategy involve combining an approach that recognises the need to develop skills for the economy &mdash; enterprise-facing skills &mdash; with active inclusion, therefore providing routes for all citizens.  I emphasise that because, frequently during the development of the strategy, people pigeonhole further education and training into one category or the other.  It either has social inclusion at its heart or it has enterprise at its heart, and never the twain shall meet.  In our view, the distinction is inaccurate.  If we are clear on the types of skills people need to get employment or increase their employability, if we are to recognise that everybody is starting from a different place on their journey and if we are true to our mission in this regard, we will link active inclusion with skills for the economy more accurately.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of apprenticeships and the fall-off therein, particularly in a number of trades.  It is true that there has been a fall-off.  Apprentice intake peaked in 2006 and 2007 and then fell off a cliff with the decline in the economy and the construction sector generally.  There were a considerable number of apprentices stuck in the system because they were not able to complete their programmes.  There was considerable investment in supporting those apprentices who were stuck to get over the line with some degree of success.  What we are observing is that, overall in respect of the existing set of 25 apprenticeships, recruitment this year has increased significantly over last year.  It is up approximately 47% year on year.  It is not where it needs to be.  The long-range needs of the economy require a greater intake of apprentices, including in the types of disciplines the Deputy raised.  We are working with the Construction Industry Federation of Ireland and others to try to bring forward responses to that.<\/p><p>  With regard to guidance, we agree completely that good guidance for people who are unemployed or wish to upskill or re-skill, through the Intreo system initially for the unemployed and then through the guidance service within education and training boards, has a value.  The strategy identifies the need to improve those services.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the amalgamation process involving SOLAS and the education and training boards.  It is ongoing.  In a formal sense, 40% of the old F&Aacute;S provision transferred to the education and training boards on 1 January this year.  The balance of 60% transferred on 1 July.  With regard to the logistical aspect, that has worked very well to date.  The education and training boards invested a lot of time with SOLAS to make sure the transition worked.  At the heart of our thinking in this regard is the view that we would not drop the ball with learners during the process.  We have met the education and training boards regularly, including this morning, to ensure we are co-operating fully to advance the amalgamation and the work on the strategy overall.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's point on investment, including in STEM and other courses, we are keeping all course provision under constant review.  One of the tools we will deploy to ensure that this works and that the State is getting a return on its investment is systematic evaluation, combined with an evidence-based approach to future decision making.  It is not just a case of what we think as we will bring a structure and rigour to the assessment of all further education and training programmes, of whatever hue and for whatever purpose.<\/p> <p>During 2014 the State has directly invested &euro;640 million through SOLAS and &euro;186 million through the Department of Education and Skills in post leaving certificate course provision.  This is a combined investment of approximately &euro;826 million, approximately one quarter of which goes towards income support for participants who need it.  It is a significant investment and we want to optimise its use so it is used efficiently.  A total of 91.5% of the SOLAS budget is a programme budget, principally in the form of direct grant aid to education and training boards and others.  There are also a number of national programmes.  The overhead part of this is approximately 3.7%, and we are also responsible for discharging the pensions of former staff members of F&Aacute;S and AnCO, which absorbs approximately 4.8%.  The State is making quite a significant investment and we want to ensure it is optimised and that we provide value for money.<\/p><p> The point made on the utilisation of workshops is quite correct.  In tandem with the fall-off in the construction sector in particular, many workshops which had been geared up towards the peak were under-utilised, but this is starting to turn.  During the period when we did not have the flow of new apprenticeships and new courses, we tried to provide workshop-based upskilling and reskilling.  We tried to manage the utilisation over this period.  I expect that as the economy turns we will start to have full utilisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200007#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked about the number of apprentices in particular disciplines.  The defining feature of the apprenticeship system is that the number of apprentices in the system is the number of boys and girls whom employers wish to employ.  Therefore, it is protected against oversupply.  The working committee on apprenticeship was faced with two difficult issues which we could not solve.  In an ideal world there should be a system whereby somebody employs a base stock of apprentices to prevent an under-correction.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have kittens if this were brought any further.  Conversely, at the height of the cycle there should be a way set a maximum, but it would have taken a brave person to tell a builder at the height of the boom that he or she could not take on any more carpenters or joiners because there would be a surplus.  One would probably have ended up in the High Court in a case taken on the right to earn a living.  These issues exist.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the school year.  I am on the board of Skillnets, which is the training networks initiative.  It deals mainly with private-sector trainers.  Very little training is done in July, August and December.  To the best of my knowledge there are no live proposals to change the school year.  The differences may be more apparent than real.  An issue that might arise is why every course must start in September.  Perhaps some courses could start in January.  At present, if somebody is made unemployed in January, he or she must wait until September.  This issue might need to be resolved.<\/p><p>  If I can be so bold as to make a suggestion to the committee, if it wants to go into detail and lift the bonnet on the sector, it should invite Seamus McGuinness and Dr. John Sweeney, both of whom have written reports, to come before it.  Seamus McGuinness was the lead researcher on the ESRI report which was mentioned, and Dr. John Sweeney produced a report for the National Economic and Social Council.  They would give the committee two sometimes different views, which is a good thing, on how the sector works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue mentioned a fear that this would be supply-driven and that courses or programmes would not be sufficiently demand-led.  There is huge potential and an opportunity for education and training boards to have a statutory sub-committee which represents local employers as well as the local providers, which are the education and training board and training and programme staff.  This would mean direct communication between employers, local industry and trainers.  In this way there would be direct engagement in each of the 16 catchment areas between the training centres or further education colleges and employers.  This would be very beneficial.  In 1997 plans were drawn up to do this through an adult education sub-committee.  It would be one way to address the issue, and would assure everybody that the courses would remain demand-led.<\/p><p>  The issue of guidance is important.  Education and Training Boards Ireland has repeatedly campaigned for proper guidance, particularly for the adult learning community.  These people are vulnerable and marginalised.  They may have lost a job, and perhaps their confidence, and are disoriented to a large extent.  They need direct support and guidance at a very vulnerable period in their lives.  This is why it is imperative to have a proper and effective guidance service, which we do not have at present as it has vastly reduced resources.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned resource issues, and perhaps he was speaking about training centres.  Post leaving certificate colleges are managed in the same way as second level schools, which is a crazy system.  They have never moved along from the structure and funding model of second level schools.  In 2008, just before the crash, we had agreed with trade unions and the Department to have a new structure which would be relevant to post leaving certificate course colleges.  These colleges are populated by adults and not by children.  We need to re-examine the establishment of a relevant support structure in these colleges which meets the needs of their clients.<\/p><p>  In the editorial I wrote for the most recent edition of ETBI news I raised the issue of working all year round.  We now have under the same bodies - the ETBs - training centres, which are effectively open and providing training and support 52 weeks of the year, and post leaving certificate course colleges, which are open for considerably less time than this as they are closed for July, August and part of September.  This needs to be addressed.  We have had informal discussions with the Teachers' Union of Ireland on this, and the former president, who is now a Senator, has raised the issue with me.  Teachers' unions are facing a dilemma in the sector.  If we are all there for the benefit of our clients and students we must examine year-round provision which meets the needs of the people we serve.  I seek engagement with teachers' unions, the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS to see if we can move from what is a school year to year-round provision in our colleges, as we have in our training centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked about meeting future demand for skills.

The pupil-teacher ratio increased to 19:1, which had an impact on the number of teachers available to teach in post leaving certificate colleges.  It reduced the capacity of a college to be as flexible as it might have been.  The effect was felt in the provision of courses with smaller numbers, as the colleges had to ensure the numbers were as high as possible.  The cap is a separate issue, and probably less of an issue this year than it was previously, as the numbers coming to post leaving certificate courses this year were lower throughout the country than they had been in previous years.  This is for a number of reasons.<\/p> <p>There are many changes in respect of Intreo as well as other external factors that changed the profile of the students coming to us at post leaving certificate level.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the impact on the pupil-teacher ratio.  It reduces the number of teachers available to the colleges.  Principally, this has the effect of reducing flexibility in terms of provision and the number of courses we can put on.  In general, the post leaving certificate courses reflect the skills needs in the areas they serve.  Generally speaking, the courses are aimed at providing skills that are needed in the economy.  Obviously, changes in recent years have affected us and certain courses have become almost redundant, especially those related to the construction sector, as was the case in respect of apprenticeships.  This has affected the colleges and resulted in a surplus of teachers in some areas.  That is the type of thing that has happened.  In general, the post leaving certificate colleges are thriving.  Reference was made to the fact that they are oversubscribed.  Most of them are still oversubscribed to a large extent.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue asked a question about amalgamation.  From the point of view of the education and training boards, the amalgamation has gone far more sweetly than we had anticipated.  We had many fears around it.  Most people facing any kind of major shift or merger would have big fears about such a change.  Thanks to our work with SOLAS in respect of the training centres coming across and through our work with the other vocational education committees prior to the amalgamation, many of the problems were anticipated.  That does not mean we are without problems.  This is a long, slow burner.  The first further education and training strategy runs until 2019 and we do not expect to have everything done in the next two or three years.

It was interesting to listen to their presentations.  I wish to comment briefly on the sector.  The strength of the sector lies in its history, which goes back deep into the 19th century, particularly in continental Europe.  Since then, the challenge of the continuum between the individual skills and work has been tackled by educational providers very successfully, whether by direct educational apprenticeships or through other preparatory courses.  This is at the heart of its success, and something that has succeeded for so long gives great confidence and competence to the providers today.  The tradition and history of something is important to its current success and credibility, and the sector has credibility.  One need only consider the colleges in Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Crumlin and Coolock.  Young people who never had a sniff of further education are flocking to these colleges.  They are overcrowded and students cannot get into them because the word on the ground is that if a person goes there he will get something out of it, not something vague but something practical and real.  Of course there will be certificates, garlands and presentations, but there is something real as well.  This is the secret of it.  It is a secret that has been well kept for a long time.  There has been an extraordinary level of courses.  Let us consider Ballyfermot College of Further Education, for example, which has rewritten an entire genre of film-making from scratch.  Other colleges have had equally successful experiences in different categories of the world of work.<\/p><p>  There is an equation involving the individual and work and how we bridge the gap and provide a safe crossing over the chasm.  This is what these initiatives have done.  It is extraordinary but it is not properly understood by people who write about it.  I happen to know a little about it because I was in it for a long time.  I hated leaving it and I might to go back to it.  Anyway, this has opened up a world for people from various social classes who, at 17, 18 or 19 years of age, had never been inside a college, and it has transformed their lives.  It is an extraordinary development.  Part of its success is that when something has history behind it, it gives a person two things: competence and confidence.  The talk of changing structures is peripheral.  The message is the same even if the way of delivering it has been modified a little.  It is simply technological change, but the basics never change.  There are human beings and there is the desire to work and be productive.  That much is eternal and never changes.  I commend the work that the deputation is doing because it is undervalued, but it is very valuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200009#K00300","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1415800500,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome the deputation.  There was a vote in the Seanad so I offer my apologies if the witnesses have already answered some of these questions.  My first question is for SOLAS and relates to labour market forecasting.  I am keen to hear the views on how it currently works.  I understand the SOLAS labour market research unit carries out forecasting.  Is SOLAS satisfied with the current abilities of the structure and how it is resourced?  Following the crash, many skilled people were left unemployed and without the necessary skills to bridge the gaps that existed.  I do not remember any statutory or semi-state body shouting out that this was going to happen.  Fundamentally, it is a question about predicting the labour market.  Are we in a better position now?  Are we setting out the structures whereby such an occurrence can be pre-empted or groups can forecast where the labour market is going?  That involves linking with business.  Where do we stand currently in that regard?  It is important that the same mistakes are not made again.<\/p><p>  The IBEC deputation referenced the OECD and the inevitability of vocational programmes in educational institutions becoming self-fulfilling as well as how they are not actually responding to business needs.  Where exactly do we stand on that?  Do we have sufficient business presence with regard to our labour market needs?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to re-skilling.  For example, following the crash, the skills of electricians were no longer required to the same extent.  I know people who changed course completely but got little support from the State with regard to a new career and re-skilling.  These issues need to be examined.  Germany has 350 recognised occupations covered by apprenticeship schemes, whereas here, according to my last recollection, the corresponding figure was 30 recognised trades which come under the relevant schemes.  What is the position with regard to this and occupations covered under the apprenticeship schemes?<\/p><p>  I will outline one example involving a young man who came to me.  He wanted to a course that happened to be in welding.  He was Galway-based but no training course was available there and he had to go to Ballina.  He was enthusiastic about it and went for his interview.  He got some equipment to do the welding course and practised with it.  He was eager and determined.  Then he did the interview, but did not get onto the course.  He got a one- or two-line response.  That was not encouraging for a young person.  I imagine it was a run-of-the-mill response, but we are supposed to be tackling youth unemployment.  I realise there is a balance to be struck with regard to long-term unemployment and youth employment.  There was a view that perhaps it went to someone on the live register who was long-term unemployed; I do not know.  I suppose that is equally commendable, but my point is we need to ensure that we are encouraging our young people throughout the process and that they get proper feedback.  This man went through a great deal of work to be successful in his interview and application.  It is important that we work with young people to encourage them and give them feedback rather than write out the standard letter.<\/p><p>  It is a little like mentoring but it is critical.  Someone mentioned self-esteem as I walked in the door, although I am unsure in what context.  Anyway, it is important that we tackle youth unemployment.  These people could potentially be our long-term unemployed.  I appreciate that we have a balance to strike between getting people who are long-term unemployed off the live register and tackling youth unemployment.<\/p> <p>I refer to the geographical spread of the courses.  He was prepared to travel to the next county to attend the training course.  I speak in general terms, but it is about striking a balance and getting to and tapping into enthusiastic young people when they have just left school or college.

I am sorry I had to leave, but there was a division in the Seanad.  <\/p><p>  It is no secret that I am a product of the further education sector and that I am always looking over my shoulder at the staff of the old VEC schools who gave us the sector we have today.  The system was not planned and grew organically.  We owe a significant amount to teachers and principals, in particular.  I have come across some imaginative principals in my time.<\/p><p>  I have a number of concerns about where we are going.  The first concerns the allocation of staff to further education colleges.  I am not sure if this issue was dealt with.  However, the allocation is based on the second level staffing system and it concerns me greatly that we are trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.  It simply will not work.  For example, every college should have a liaison officer to deal with local industry and who would be responsible for promoting courses and the college locally.  In the not too distant past a number of ETBs sought to second staff to be further education development officers.  I applaud this and funding should be made available for it because ETB managers are overwhelmed by the volume of work they must do, besides trying to take on an additional role.  If one considers the multiplicity of programmes offered by the large boards such as those in Cork, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoighaire, etc., there is so much work for the senior management team to do that it is not possible to allocate the time needed to conduct an overview of the development of further education and training within their areas.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about course development in further education colleges, in particular.  The college in Ballyfermot has developed outstanding programmes which were developed organically and for which there was no great plan.  They were a product of the innovation of the teachers.  I would not like SOLAS, with its overarching responsibility, to ring-fencie or take a national view of how courses should be developed and kill off innovation at the bottom of the pile where the teachers are.<\/p><p>  I am worried about the funding mechanisms that will be in place down the line, especially when the delegates refer to output-based funding.  I can understand from a quality assurance and a value for money point of view that people want to see a return for their money or outputs to reflect the input of cash.  However, there is an holistic aspect to education that we must address.  Not everybody will achieve or receive a certificate; therefore, they must be catered for.  I am not sure whether they should be catered for by modular provision or by allowing them to explore the programmes that might benefit them.<\/p><p>  Modular provision brings me back to services for industry.  Training centres market their programmes and meet the needs of industry in the workplace and I have long been saying further education colleges should do the same.  I recall a number of years ago planning to deliver a degree programme to De Beers in Shannon.  I would like to see that flexibility and freedom in the sector.  My former union members might have a difficulty with moving in that direction, but it is the one in which a modern economy needs to go to deliver programmes.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that every ETB does not have training centres located within its area   If I was an ETB chief executive officer, I would not want to borrow from a neighbouring board to provide training; I would want to have control in my area.<\/p><p>  I am extremely proud of the further education sector and the old IVEA and the ETBI for the work they did in developing the sector.  If it is to receive the recognition it deserves, SOLAS must come in 100% behind it, fund and staff it properly and give the teachers, lecturers and tutors the standing they rightly deserve in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200010#L00200","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1415801100,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Reference was made to assessing the need for courses.  In many cases, it is difficult to assess what is required when we do not know which companies will take on apprentices.  I was a victim of this.  In the past few years skills shortages have emerged.  When one is prepared to sponsor someone and offer him or her an apprenticeship, one is stopped because he or she does not have a piece of paper.  People aged between 45 and 55 years such as me went out into the world and learned from those who had gone before them.  We did not have a piece of paper in our hand.  I gave a document to the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Damien English.  Around Ireland there are people aged between 55 and 60 years who are willing to hand on the torch and it would not cost the Government money.  They have sons and daughters with different skills sets.  They are willing to do this, but because of the need to have a little piece of paper, they are forbidden from doing so.<\/p><p>  AnCO was one of the greatest organisations ever.  Anybody who came out of it was trained to a standard.  I have worked on many construction sites and during the boom, if one acted and looked like a driver, one was a driver, but I guarantee that this cannot continue.  The standard being set for apprenticeships is not good enough.  A little piece of paper that tells someone he or she can go down a fall and dig a trench 20 yards long does not make him or her a digger driver.  As Senator Hildegarde Naughton said, a long time ago people went to Mervue or the boatyards in Galway to take welding courses and so on and they learned a trade.  The six week course now provided does not make a heavy welder; the hours and resources have to be put in.  I question the pieces of paper going around.  We have to change the mindset behind the way we do everything.<\/p><p>  We talk about looking forward.  A year ago we were looking forward to the roll-out of broadband services, with wires to be laid and so on.  However, we are importing 260 people every six months to do this, while, at the same time, only 16 people are being trained in a college to do this work.  I hope common sense will prevail because I am passionate about apprenticeships.  I have identified the urgent need for between 5,000 and 6,000 apprentices.  I have identified where 90% of the crane drivers aged between 65 and 70 years are and the different skills sets people in this age cohort possess.  I believe in technology and moving forward, but if apprenticeships are not served on the ground, one will not have the building in which to put the computer or the road leading to the building.  A root and branch analysis of the system is needed and courses have to be lengthened.  There is a shimozzle over trainers and safety courses.<\/p> <p>This comes from employers.  It costs a person &euro;300 to take a safety training course and the next course also costs &euro;300.  We need a multitasker to deliver courses at a price people can afford to drive forward all of the different skills sets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200010#L00300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415801700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked the question I was going to pose and more ably than I would have.

In the context of a five year strategy to develop educational skills, the flexibility of the back to education allowance is important.  Those who have reached a certain level on the qualifications framework but want to retrain at a lower level are unable to do so because they are blocked from accessing allowances and assistance.  There are many who have trained in something which has not worked out for them or which is no longer a marketable qualification and they are blocked off and unable to participate in something which would get them back into the workforce.

We do not know the impact of the BTEA rules or the 2020 allowance.  Although we are not certain what factors cause a drop or reduction, individual learners tell us situations are caused by the existing rules.  Given that we need rules, how do we get around the problem?  How do we make exceptions?  Senator Hildegarde Naughton mentioned exceptions being made in particular circumstances, which is a difficulty, not so much for us but for the Department of Social Protection or Education and Skills.  All the rules are in place for a particular reason, to encourage people to continue on the cycle of returning to education and upskilling, and they have an impact on those who are unable to work using a particular skill and want to retrain.  The issue often arises in our discussions because people return to us who want to be reskilled but for whom these barriers are in place.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputies Gerard P.

They take great pride in the standard they have reached.  <\/p><p>  Members have also mentioned the length of time training takes.  It takes time to develop serious skills.  Members probably referred to upskilling in an area such as heavy welding or other short courses developed to build on existing skills.  There is a view about whether they were sufficient.

All existing apprenticeships are under formal review at the moment.  They are being worked through a process with SOLAS and partners and will be considered by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, later this month.  There is a process whereby people with skills and experience in a particular craft can seek to acquire the qualification through a process called \"recognition of prior learning\".  They would be assessed under this process.  It is not for everybody so I do not want to overstate it, but we can provide details of that to the Deputy if he is interested in following up on the point.<\/p><p> Deputy Bannon asked whether people lost out simply because of a threshold.  I cannot speak to the JobBridge programme as that is under the remit of the Department of  Social Protection, but if people are supported and have the information there is a huge range of opportunities, some at very low cost, so that people need not be left behind just because of that threshold.

Just to reassure some of the people who are here, particularly from a further education background, it is not just about labour market activation.

We are projecting employment to reach 2.02 million by the year 2020.  Our current forecasters are predicting that construction employment will reach approximately 150,000 in 2017.  That is in the context where probably the largest category of occupation on the live register is craft-related areas, at roughly 70,000 people.<br\/>The labour market research unit has a number of outputs.  We host the national skills database, which is a very useful tool, and from that we assist the expert group on future skill needs in a number of publications on an annual basis, most notably the <i>National Skills Bulletin <\/i>and the training and education outputs.  We monitor bricks-and-mortar and online recruitment agencies for vacancies and monitor those trends over time.  We also publish for apprenticeship forecasting, and expect to become heavily involved in forecasting for the new apprenticeship council that is to be established shortly.  <br\/>We conduct follow-up-surveys every two years, and this is an important aspect of what we have been doing, on the training provision since the mid-1990s.  Recently we have been doing them every year so we are able to monitor and track the effectiveness of the provision.  This year, there have been a couple of developments to expand that into the further education sector.  SOLAS is currently working with statisticians from the Department of Education and Skills and the Central Statistics Office with a view to identifying the economic status of former learners who participated in PLC programmes in 2013, for example.  The data will be used to complement the results of the follow-up survey which SOLAS has conducted of former F&Aacute;S trainees who also attended courses in 2012.  We also intend to conduct another follow-up survey in early 2015 of former learners who attended F&Aacute;S courses in 2013.  We are currently engaged in negotiations with the CSO with a view to gaining access to four major administrative datasets which will enable the skills and labour market research unit to continuously monitor the economic status of former learners on FET outcomes.  <br\/>On the one hand, we have identification of skills and, on the other, over the next few years we will be able to carry out tracking.  That is all very well, but what do we do now?  Each year we publish regional labour market profiles which are presented to each of the educational training boards and that breaks down the labour and employment demographics and the supply of education and training by region.

This is done under five broad areas where further education providers could consider enhancing provision: selling and marketing, supply chain management, green economy and ICT.

The on-the-job aspect is critical, particularly for young people.<br\/>Commentators have made reference to the German apprenticeship system, but it is worth mentioning that the German system serves two main purposes - direct transition from school into the labour market for young and old alike and securing the skills that companies need.  However, what we tend not to hear is that, under the German model, one must go through a particular training programme and become licensed to take up one of the 350 occupations.  This debate may need to be held in Ireland in respect of new apprenticeships and occupations.  Of the 2.1 million businesses in Germany, approximately 450,000 are involved in apprenticeships.  Three quarters of businesses are not involved <i>per se<\/i>.  The 1.3 million apprentices are governed by a national compact under which employers make places available across the occupations.  There is a central clearing house.  We may need to examine whether the Irish economy can support this number of new occupations, as we do not know.  We have been in discussions with employers and the range of apprenticeships will expand, as it must.

I will ask my colleague Dr. Bryan Fields to comment later.  First, I wish to say that every programme, no matter what its source or nature, must have an objective and targeted outcome.  The key point is that it would be a labour market outcome in some or several cases.  Many people are not at that stage yet, so we have to devise the indicators of success around the nature of the programme.  That is done in an open way and it is our intention to do so.  Dr. Fields might discuss the matter further.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned a couple of related points such as the transparency of funding.  This year, with a gargantuan effort and co-operation by the education and training boards, we published the first further education and training services plan.

That is a starting point, and we will develop the initiative.<\/p><p>  Let me turn to third level education.  There were two aspects to the points made about third level education.  Perhaps my comments will also answer Senator Jim D'Arcy's point.  Over the past number of years, almost 20% of people who undertook training courses had a third level qualification but had found themselves unemployed.  They sought a supplementary skill or change of direction and the system was very open to that idea.<\/p><p>  The points made by the Chairman probably open up a broader discussion.  We have tended to pigeonhole qualifications around the third level or further education and training sector.  Perhaps that is the issue we need to address.  Some of the Senators and Deputies made the point about what is valued.  As I said in my opening statement, the SOLAS mandate covers the National Framework of Qualifications levels 1 to 6, which is intermediate, technical and entry levels.  That is our space and that is what we work with, but it does not preclude a more sensible allocation in terms of how courses are delivered.

Over the past number of years I have been concerned about the notion, reinforced by the publication of school league tables in the national press, that success is determined only by access to third level education, which is completely and utterly wrong.  As Senator Craughwell has rightly said, people enter into further education and graduate from further education colleges with significant qualifications and skills.  Unfortunately, the league tables do not give them credit and their omission is dumping on the further education sector.  As I have done before, I appeal to the press to bear that in mind and end their dreadful disservice to our sector.<\/p><p>  Senator Craughwell and others have mentioned skills.  The European Commission and all the recent reports talk about the importance of generic skills, which are critical thinking, the ability to work in a team and the ability to speak in public.  An important part of community education is the development of confidence and the development of a rounded person.  We have the specific skills as well.  There must be a balance in the education and training system between what industry demands in terms of specific skills and the provision of the important social dimension of educating people in generic and developmental skills.

ETBs are now up and running but it took a long time to establish the boards.  The final one was established only ten days ago, and the names will be available on our website.  As I reckon this will be my last opportunity to talk today, I congratulate Senator Craughwell on his elevation to the Seanad.  He comes from this sector.   <\/p><p>  Finally, we have hosted visits by three international groups in recent months.  They came here to look at the massive reform that has taken place and were impressed, even though it is in its infancy and its full impact has not become evident yet.  They are very engaged in what we have done here, particularly those from the new accession countries to the European Union from Eastern Europe.  Recently we brought them to the Blackrock Further Education Institute, which is under the remit of the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB.  Senator Craughwell will be very familiar with the establishment.  It is an outstanding establishment and a credit to the sector.  I was delighted to bring our international visitors to such a fine establishment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200014#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1415803500,"counter":59,"content":"<p>As Senator Jim D'Arcy has returned, I can tell him that his question on ETBs has been answered and the last ETB was set up ten days ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200014#P00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415803500,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I said that there had been a long election process for the ETBs, but that is now complete and we will make the names available.

We touched on a number of items in our submission.  We gave a high level overview of our issues with the value for money review.  We indicated the value that the Reserve Defence Force brings to the State, the civilian skills that the Reserve Defence Force has at its disposal and we indicated we would seek an independent review of the Reserve Defence Force.  We also expressed a view that there was a very real risk that, because of the value for money review and reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force, the force would cease to exist by 2016.<\/p><p>  The value for money review recommended that a further formal review of the Reserve Defence Force be conducted after a period of four years with a view to examining the utility and capacity levels and the progress of the reserve.  We are now at the half way mark and we think it opportune to provide our views on what has transpired.  We will do this under four main pillars: first, the introduction of key performance indicators; second, the structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force; third, recruitment; and fourth, the package of support required for the Reserve Defence Force. <\/p><p>These areas can be explored in depth with my colleagues during the question and answer session.  I ask for the indulgence of members as I can give them the view of the Army Reserve but not of the Naval Service reserve.  I will invite my colleague Mr Colgan to make some points in that regard when I finish.<\/p><p>  While we have always objected to the premise for the latest reorganisation, we do have to commend the Defence Force on how it has approached its task.<\/p> <p>As always, it has demonstrated that leadership in change management, so much so that the administrative order that was to change the Reserve Defence Force was issued the same month as the value for money review was published.  That was a very quick timeframe.  It was not formalised until 2013, but this is the document that governed the restructuring in the Reserve Defence Force and what was to happen thereafter.  A core tenet of this administrative order is what is known as &ldquo;the single Force concept&rdquo;.  This entailed the disestablishment of Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve units and the insertion of Reserve elements into permanent units. The theory behind that is that a single chain of command would allow greater scope for collective training and operational effectivenes.<br\/>The administrative instruction also sets out how the new Reserve Defence Force is to operate and identifies a number of key performance indicators against which Reserve Defence personnel will be evaluated.  These are used to assess the individual effectiveness of members of the Reserve Defence Force.  They consist of a number of criteria, which include paid and unpaid training, a medical test, a fitness test and an annual personal weapons test.  The concept of objective measurement criteria is welcomed within the Reserve.  It is not something to which we are adverse.  It should serve as a true measure of the output of the organisation and it also serves as a motivational aspect that can individual reservists seek to achieve and obtain.  However, any such criteria must be realistic and achievable, and adequate resources must be given to personnel in order to achieve them.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case and there is a number issues with the key performance criteria that have been imposed on the Reserve Defence Force. These issues relate both to the criteria themselves and to the method in which they have been implemented.<br\/>I will not go into the merits of the key performance indicators, but I would like to explore some of the issues that we have encountered when we have tried to achieve them.  At the outset, the Reserve Defence Force has been imposed upon permanent units, so immediately there is a mismatch between the working hours of each element. Whilst the terms of service of the Permanent Defence Force are 24-7, in reality the usual working hours outside of operational duties or training are Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.  For the Reserve, on the other hand, the majority of the training is conducted in the evenings or at weekends in order to accommodate our civilian employment and our other obligations.  This presents an immediate problem when it comes to the administration of the key performance indicators.  For example, if I have to undergo a medical test it will be conducted by the Medical Corps, which operates during normal working hours.<br\/>The test consists of two parts, with each part conducted on two different days.  My fitness test consists of three parts, with the first two parts conducted on one day and the third part on another.  Another two days are now gone.  Additionally, if the permanent unit conducts its annual range practice, where I am tested on my weapon, on a weekday, I have now potentially used up five days of annual leave to satisfy administrative requirements.  That is essentially a reservist using up 25% of his or her statutory annual leave entitlement on administrative matters.  That is without taking into account the fact that we may be called up for full-time training.  If I do one period of full-time training, I have now used up 50% of my annual leave, and if I try to do a career course, which is generally structured over two weeks, I will have used up 75% of my statutory leave entitlement.  It is a ridiculous situation; reservists cannot be expected to meet this.  We cannot be expected to use up our annual leave on administrative tasks.  It is an unreasonable expectation, particularly where there is no legislation to protect reservists in their civilian employment.  In addition, we are being asked to meet these criteria without the same support that our permanent colleagues have.  We are not entitled to the same medical care or benefits and we do not have the access to facilities that they have.  It is specifically set out in the administrative instruction that reservists will not be afforded the facilities or time to train for these key performance indicators during full-time training.  All responsibility lies with the reservists, in their own time, and that is something that cannot be said for their permanent colleagues.<br\/>When the next review is conducted, the cold figures will indicate that a certain percentage of reservists have not met their key performance indicators.  No investigation will be conducted into what actually occurred, or into the organisational and administrative obstacles that were put in reservists' way.  Nor will anything be said in regard to the personal time and sacrifice that was required to meet these criteria.  Instead, the criteria will be used to denigrate reservists and will completely ignore the fact that the process has been implemented in a way that was completely unworkable. <br\/>What is particularly striking is that are no similar key performance indicators for our permanent colleagues. The Reserve Defence Force is a training output of the Permanent Defence Force.  Our standards should reflect on the input of the Permanent Defence Force.  When assessing the output of any service, surely it would make sense to assess the service provider.  Yet again the regime is set up to scrutinise the reservists and we must stand up and be counted.  There is no similar situation for our permanent colleagues, who will say they have training standards to meet each year which include accounting for the Reserve.  This is a circular argument because they will use the key performance indicators of the Reserve to see whether or not they have made their training output.  Our fear is that, as happened in the last Value for Money report, questions will not be asked as to what our permanent colleagues did or did not do in respect of the Reserve.  Instead, there will be a focus on the Reserve failing to meet its objectives.  When we fail, as is already pre-determined, the true problems will conveniently be ignored. Reservists face eventual discharge for failing to meet their key performance indicators but the same cannot be said of our permanent colleagues if they fail in their obligations to the Reserve. <br\/><b><\/b>I would like to speak about the structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  Aside from the issues with key performance indicators, we have to contend with the difficulties of dealing with a full-time professional Force as part-time professionals. There is no doubt in our minds that there is commitment to the Reserve Defence Force at the very highest levels in the Defence Forces.  The General Staff has indicated that it is committed to making this work.  The addition of Reserve elements to permanent units represents an additional workload on top of the existing workload, with no incentive or reward in return. We noted when we were last before this committee that the loss of the cadre staff was significant in terms of the loss of experience and knowledge.  It appeared to us that the reorganisation was being pushed through in a very tight timeframe without adequate consideration of the inherent differences between both organisations.  Many of our concerns have proven justified. <br\/>The reorganisation was supposed to be implemented by 30 March 2013, yet in 2014 we were still dealing with issues arising from it.  As the reorganisation progressed, it was very evident that there were significant issues in the records and administration of the Reserve Defence Forces and this impeded the smooth transition of the Reserve into the permanent Defence Forces.  On top of this, many of the cadre staff retired and, with them, their knowledge and experience was lost.  Permanent units were left to grapple with an administration system with which they were not familiar and on which they were not trained.  As a result, reservists have suffered delays in pay, restrictions on training and denial of entitlements.  Greater demands are being placed on reservists in respect of training during normal working hours so that they can train with their permanent colleagues.  By no means is this a criticism of the permanent Defence Force.  It would be unrealistic to expect someone to work all week and then come in again in the evenings or at weekends for no extra incentive or reward. The irony is that this is exactly what reservists are expected to do.  We have gone to a situation where our rewards and incentives have been taken away and the incentive is more &ldquo;stick&rdquo; than &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; at this point.<br\/>Compounding this is the problem that the complete military legislative and administrative structure to govern the reorganised Reserve has not been put in place.  It is astounding that 20 months into the reorganisation, we are still working under old administrative systems which do not take account of the reorganisation or the increased standards and commitment required of the Reserve.  There is an inconsistency between the old regulations and the newly introduced key performance indicators and this has led to confusion as to what governs reservists and what happens if reservists do not meet their key performance indicators.<\/p> <p> As a result of the knowledge deficit the permanent units have been forced to do the best they can under the circumstances.  Unfortunately, this has resulted in a lack of uniformity of decisions, with unit commanders taking varying approaches to clothing, equipment, training, recording of training hours, development of courses and limits on paid training.  Depending on their unit, some reservists have been able to engage in training that was beyond their wildest dreams and others have suffered through what we would term \"malicious obedience\" on the part of middle management, whereby the focus is on attaining key performance indicators, with no advancement of reservists' military skills or training.<\/p><p> On the issue of recruitment, the administrative instruction for the organisation identifies that a priority for it will be whether it can maintain the level of quality recruitment necessary to staff the Reserve Defence Force for the next 3&ndash;5 years.  The establishment of the Reserve Defence Force went from 9,500 to 4,069.  By January 2014 we were already 1,200 under strength.  The current strength is 1,734.  In order to meet our establishment by 2016, we must recruit 2,335 reservists.  This represents a figure of over 1,000 recruits a year, which would prove a difficult task for full-time personnel and absolutely out of reach for part-time professionals.  Simply put, the resources are not there to train that number of people in this time period.  The Reserve Defence Force will not be able to meet this and the shortcomings in its previous administration by its permanent staff meant that the numbers on the books never reflected the numbers in reality.<\/p><p> On a positive note, a recruitment campaign ran from March to April 2014.  This was a very professional campaign and was run through a combination of national and regional press media, social media and national careers portal.  It was the first time that a campaign for the Reserve Defence Forces was run in a centralised manner.  The media campaign was very positive and progressive and it represented an innovative approach to the use of many and varied forms of social media and serves only to underscore the professionalism expected in the Reserve Defence Force today.  The \"single force\" concept was reinforced by the fact that there was no difference between the campaign for reservists and the Permanent Defence Force and there was no sense of disparity in the value that either arm of the Defence Forces provides to the State.  Objective bystanders would have obtained an impression of a young, professional combined force with plenty of opportunities for the young, willing and able.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, there were some disadvantages to the approach.  Advertising for both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force on the same platform caused confusion.  This was compounded by the fact that applicants were directed to the Defence Forces&rsquo; website where the application process was conducted under the \"careers\" section.  The Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve have their own dedicated sections of this website and it would have been logical for applications for either element to go through that.  However, it went through the careers section, which caused confusion for people who are less knowledgeable about the Defence Forces.  In addition, service in the Reserve is not technically a career.  This added to the confusion.  From our research, we know that certain applicants erroneously applied for the Reserve when they had intended to apply for the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p><p> Successful applicants then progressed to the assessment stage of the campaign.  The assessments consisted of a fitness test, interview and medical exam.  Again, this is a positive development for the Reserve Defence Force as it demonstrates a professional approach to the recruitment and selection of appropriate candidates for the Reserve.  This assessment process is usually the first time these candidates meet face-to-face and the process reinforces the fact that candidates are joining a modern and well-equipped Defence Force.  However, issues arose at this stage whereby candidates for the Reserve Defence Force were treated in a similar manner to candidates for the Permanent Defence Force.  Some were given short notice of medical tests and interviews.  Interviews were conducted during the working week which meant that those in employment had to take leave from work to attend.  <\/p><p> To its credit, the Permanent Defence Force has learned from the early campaign and is implementing a new recruitment campaign that has taken on some of our recommendations.  Unfortunately it does not take away from the fact that of two recruitment campaigns in 2014, one was flawed and the other will not provide output until 2015.  We are therefore in a situation where we cannot reach our established strength by 2016 and we believe that this will again be pointed to as a failure on the part of the Reserve.<\/p><p> We would like to make it clear that we embrace the single Force concept and its ideals.  However, this concept cannot be implemented successfully by the Defence Forces alone.  It requires a robust and holistic approach based on four pillars.  In order to have a viable and effective Reserve Defence Force, we need a complete package which includes a shift in Government defence policy, legislative underpinning and engagement with employers. <\/p><p> This approach will require bravery.  It requires the same type of courage demonstrated by the current Chief of Staff in the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  This courage is now also required on the part of politicians, such as this committee.  As it stands, the Reserve Defence Force is being set up to fail - the outcome of the next review is virtually preordained.  The authors of the value for money review have been quite clever.  They did not get their way the first time, so they have set up a structure whereby, at the next review, they will sit back and say &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;.  That is sad on so many levels.<\/p><p> With the Chair's indulgence, I would like to ask Mr. Eoin Colgan to make some remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415803200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>We are way over five minutes, but I would like to give the witnesses as much flexibility as possible if my colleagues do not mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200004#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415803200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I addressed this committee in 2013 and I thank it for granting me that privilege on that occasion.  On that occasion we were dealing with the fall-out from the value for money report and we made a conscious decision to take a positive and proactive approach to this report.  We were happy that it had come and we were going to get on with it.  We were then, and still are, very much committed to making it work.  For the public record, I would like to make the point that from the perspective of the Naval Service Reserve, the value for money report was an odious document, which was reverse-engineered to arrive at a predetermined conclusion that the Reserve Defence Force, both the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve, were a bad lot and had to be got rid of.  Naval Service Reserve personnel found it particularly galling that the efforts and successes of the force had been quite washed out.  No naval officer was on that value for money board and therefore we feel the Department took the chance to airbrush the Naval Service Reserve success out of that report.  One might ask why it would do that.  The answer is simple: the Naval Service Reserve showed the inconvenient truth that the professional military organisation, the Navy, could use its reserve in an effective manner for the benefit of both the navy and the general public.  If one had the time to go back and read that report, one would find that there are far more references to and discussion of the Garda Reserve than the Naval Service Reserve.  The net result of this report from our perspective is that we were slashed from an establishment of 400 to 200, despite the fact that we live on an island in the Atlantic, with a coastline of some 7800 km.  Some 200 personnel between our four units left us with 50 personnel for each unit and a long list of key performance indicators to be achieved.  We feel we have been set up to fail.<\/p><p>  In practice the Naval Service Reserve's experience of the single Force concept has been that it is a lot of paperwork and very little in the way of actual support regarding increased training or equipment.  The truth is that the single Force concept of trying to merge the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force into a seamless unit is a bit like trying to merge the HSE and Ryanair.  It will take a long time and will require many changes of mentality on both sides.  I emphasise both sides here, not just the Reserve.  In fact, the single Force concept, were it to be properly executed in all its aims and goals, would be far more traumatic to the Permanent Defence Force than ourselves.  At the moment the land-based element of the naval service operates like the army.  That is to say that it operates within a bubble world within the naval base Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.  The navy, like the army, has become very good at wrapping itself up in its own self-imposed regulations and paperwork.  Their idea of a single Force concept is that we operate exactly like they do.  They have made no compromise in the way they operate to incorporate us.  To give a perfect example of this, we were told in early 2013 that just like the naval service, the Naval Service Reserve must use a document called the Manual of Staff Duties when planning and applying for anything.<\/p> <p> The manual of staff duties was hand typed in 1980, so we had to operate to a 34-year old hand-typed document, which could not be removed from the barracks.  I will give three very brief examples of the other kind of non-compromising procedures and bureaucracy that the Naval Service Reserve, NSR, has to contend with in our battle to try to make the single Force concept successful.  The first one is NSR, similar to Army reserve units, are meant to be self-administrating so a prerequisite for the MIF course, which is a course pertaining to logistics and the computer system, is having a European computer driving licence, ECDL.  To do an ECDL in the Defence Forces takes a mere four weeks of solid full-time training while, if one were to do it in the civilian world it would take ten hours in various evening courses.<\/p><p> As Mr. Cooney outlined, we had a recruitment campaign and the fitness tests are now the exact same as for the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, which is to be welcomed.  However, in our unit, the Naval Service ran the fitness tests in the middle of the day over a Tuesday and Wednesday.  The new recruits who wanted to join the Naval Service Reserve were asked to come for a fitness test in Limerick in the middle of the day on a Tuesday and Wednesday.  No consideration was given to the fact that such people are part-time, that they have jobs or are students on courses.  In fairness, the Naval Service learned from the experience and now they will run the fitness tests at the weekend.  However, the suggestion is that the course will be run at the naval base which means people from Limerick and Waterford must travel there.  Why could they not come to us?<\/p><p> The third and final example of what goes on relates to eyesight standards.  Due to a bureaucratic anomaly the Naval Service Reserve must now have a higher eyesight standard than any other branch of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Army Reserve and even the Naval Service itself.  When we proposed a solution to get around the anomaly, the Naval Service looked at it and thanked us and said it made very interesting reading.  Following that, it responded with a half-page e-mail with nine references to our proposal being either &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;, &ldquo;not currently possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo;.  One would think we were trying to land a man on the moon.<\/p><p> Those are just three examples of what we encounter.  The non-compromising paperwork and bureaucracy is being successfully used to waste time.  The changes called for in the value for money report are not being made.  The full list of key performance indicators are not being met.  No preplanning has taken place with us to discuss what changes have to be made, despite several requests from our side of the fence.<\/p><p> Our fear is that the value for money review, which is set for 2016, has been set to coincide with the election and following the election there will be a new Minister for Defence and that sometime after the Easter commemorations the Department of Defence will drop a review report on the new Minister&rsquo;s desk and say it gave the reserve a chance but it could not meet it, and that it is time to disband the reserve.  As the Taoiseach himself recently said, the Civil Service has the best people in the world to write a 300 page report on why things cannot get done.  In order to get where we need to get, what we in the NSR want and need, is a far more positive, flexible and accommodating response from the Naval Service, the Army and the Department of Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Colgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415803800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Colgan.

It is very important that the committee agreed to invite the representative body before it and it is to be lauded on its actions.<\/p><p>  Given the day that is in it, the time available will not perhaps allow for the type of in-depth discussion we need.  Could we reserve time in the coming weeks, no later than that, for the committee to engage constructively on the points that have been brought to our attention?  When the Reserve Defence Force representatives came before us in April of last year it is probably true to say that some people felt they were being perhaps a little alarmist.  A year and a half later there is a sense of fatalism in what they have said to us.  I had many questions to put, but what is really needed in the situation is an affirmation on the part of the committee of a recognition of the importance of the Reserve Defence Force.  The reserves are a critical part of the defence structure on this island.  We must look at the issue in the context of the fact that we have pared back our Permanent Defence Force to 9,500 members.  We have the lowest expenditure among neutral countries as a percentage of GDP in the European Union.  The Reserve Defence Force is operating way below its establishment strength.<\/p><p>  We have been asked to conduct a review.  I have one question in that respect.  Is the committee being asked to conduct the review or is it considered that we should secure outside expertise to carry it out on our behalf?  I think I speak for members on all sides when I say that there is a recognition among the body politic of the importance of reservists.  If it is the sense of the witnesses that they have been set up by faceless bureaucrats within a system, the purpose of which is to make them fail, then that is not our ambition for them, which is to see them realise their full potential.  The committee should and will do everything in its power to work with reservists to ensure the sort of priority they deserve is given to them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200005#D00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1415803800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l have any specific question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200005#D00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1415803800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>None other than how they feel we should undertake the review to which they referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200005#D00500","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1415803800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>They were interesting points.

First, I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their excellent submission.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, that members value the Reserve Defence Forces and it is recognised across all the political parties.  However, when one gets down to the nuts and bolts of this debate, it pertains to value for money.  My initial reaction, when hearing that term, is that of course one must be responsible in that one is spending taxpayers' money in respect of the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association.  However, as far as I am concerned, I want commitment and dedication to the job in the Reserve Defence Forces.  That would be my first priority and is what the State should seek.  My first question relates to the association's submission, in which it states that 2,335 reservists must be recruited by 2016 to meet the establishment number and that this will be an extremely difficult target to reach.  That target is a year and a half away.  Why does the association say that and why will it be so difficult?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200006#E00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415804400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>As for the reason it is difficult, if one looks at any recruitment campaign - say the last one that happened earlier this year - the upshot of the entire campaign is that for the formation in, for example, the Defence Forces training centre, DFTC, one gets a recruit platoon.  I am unsure of the exact numbers but in general, one gets perhaps 50 people for that formation and then there are three formations.  As for the current campaign that is ongoing again in the DFTC, I believe there are 80 applicants for that at present.  In general, our figures show that for any one successful recruit, one needs four applicants.  Consequently, just on a statistical level, to recruit 1,000 successful applicants, one would need 4,000 applications.  That said, if one got the interest, the resources are not there to train them.  One needs people on the ground to train reservists and I would challenge any semi-State or State body to recruit 1,000 people in a year in circumstances in which they must have the people undergo medical examinations and security checks, which can take anything from six to 12 weeks, as well as to undergo interviews and the entire process.  Consequently, there are logistical issues with training that number of people, whereby one is trying to bring up part-time personnel on their spare time and using up their previous annual leave.  One has a permanent force that has been under huge pressure since its reorganisation and there are the issues of all the administrative criteria, leaving aside the sheer numbers, which are huge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1415804400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>That leads onto my second question.

We also had an allocation of 41,000 man-days but that number was slashed to 28,000 last year.  We now have a situation whereby the resource allocation within which we must work is &euro;1.3 million and our man-day allocation is 28,000.  As my colleague stated, if we could recruit, we are prohibited because neither the resource allocation nor the man-day allocation is there.

The VFM review came up with a figure that, as an organisation, we seriously dispute, in that it was &euro;21 million to &euro;22 million.  The RDF has suffered a downwards straight-line graph on its membership since 2009 because in that year, the restrictions came into place.  The precursor to these restrictions happened in 2008 when a recruitment campaign, which had been sanctioned by the Minister, was cancelled permanently.  In 2009, the recruiting restrictions came into place and we were not allowed to recruit more than 400 people, even though the VFM review states that we were losing 1,400 people per annum at that point and the VFM review took account of that.  However, that review contains contradictory statements and therefore, had the number of people been maintained, we would then have an RDF today that could be stood up to 4,000 members.<\/p><p>  The allocation of 4,000 members for the RDF has never come into being because, as my colleague pointed out earlier, in January 2014 we had 1,200 vacancies in the RDF and there still was attrition going on.  One thing that worked against us in a sad way is that people who had been in the RDF in Galway up until the reorganisation were transferred to Cork.  People who were in the RDF in Athlone were transferred to Dublin and people who were in the RDF in Dublin were transferred to Athlone.  The only way in which we see this is that they were discommoded intentionally.  Therefore, we lost all those people and in addition, they managed people out, because we all were given a document in March 2013 on which we were obliged to tick a box indicating whether we wished to go to a new unit, to remain with the old unit in the place it was or to be discharged.  A lot of people were managed out in that way and in consequence, our numbers fell dramatically.  However, the costs incurred did not fall at all and that is the reason for the &euro;21 million.  In a statement earlier in 2013, the Minister stated there would be a 50% reduction in the RDF, which thereby would generate a saving of &euro;11 million.  It is only a paper saving because the same people who were put down as incurring the cost factor of &euro;11 million are still in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF.  That saving is not true but as for the saving on the RDF, in 2008 we cost &euro;7.9 million whereas in 2014, we are costing &euro;1.3 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Mulley"},{"type":"speech","time":1415804400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I refer to the point made about how the reservists may be required to take up to four days in annual leave to meet simple administrative requirements and the submission then referred to using up 60% of reservists' statutory annual leave.

Basically, if one considers the individual KPIs, which are the most important, they are broken down into a medical, a fitness test, a weapons test and one's attendance over the year.  That is the shortest way of looking at it.  The main problem we are having at present is with medicals.  As that is only one quarter of the targets, one might ask what is the problem.<\/p> <p>The problem is that the medical has a knock-on affect in other areas.  A person cannot undergo a fitness test without first undergoing a medical test.<\/p><p> Consideration is being given to the introduction next year of a personal weapons test.  However, taking of the personal weapons test will be, because it is quite a strenuous test, dependent on the person having first passed a medical and fitness test.  Currently, we are being starved of the medical.  We assumed that a new medical, of a less stringent nature, would be introduced for the reserve.  I recently had a medical done.  It included an ECG and blood tests and I was offered vaccinations.  That type of medical is overkill for a reservist.  It might be said that there can be only one standard.  However, there are already different standards in place in that a member of the Air Corps or Naval Service does not have to complete part three of the fitness test.  There is not only one standard even for the PDF.  Standards can be tailored to the commitment or to what is necessary.  We do not want people who fall over, etc., during a fitness test but we do not believe it is necessary to put the taxpayer to the cost of detailed medicals for reservists.<\/p><p> Some of our suggestions in this regard include that a medical examination could be provided at the weekend by the Defence Forces; that the reservist GP provide a medical for the Defence Forces for a set fee, which would allow the reservist to attend his or her GP at a time of their own choosing, be that at the weekend or in the evening; that RDF doctors be activated to help the resources available to conduct medicals; that medicals be done every three years rather than annually, with self-certification being acceptable in the other years; and that consideration be given to the introduction of the type of medicals provided by the Canadian Defence Forces, which are of different frequency and intensity dependent on the type of service in which the person is engaged.  The reason we are harping on this medical target is because it is influencing all of the other targets.  We have been given verbal assurances by the General Staff that we will not be held to these KPIs because they are not providing the resources to us.  However, these assurances are only verbal.  The people by whom they were given may be retired by the time a review is undertaken, which review will consist of a look-back at the targets and assessment of whether or not they were met.<\/p><p> We are asking that the Defence Forces would consider the introduction of a flexible method for the achievement of medicals.

There are four key fundamentals which the reserve forces in this countries have and which ours does not.  These were pretty much glossed over in the value-for-money report.  The first of these fundamentals is operational purpose, which we have just discussed and which is absolutely pivotal.  It is necessary because recruitment and training can be orientated around it.  The second relates to employment protection legislation.  This is both a key enabler and mission critical and it is standard among all our comparator nations.  As stated earlier, it was previously present in section 57 of the Defence Forces Act 1940 but it is no longer there.  We hope that employment protection legislation will be discussed comprehensively in the context of the forthcoming White Paper.  It certainly was not discussed in connection with the value-for-money report.  If reservists do not have any guarantee that their livelihoods are safe, there is no guarantee that we can actually mobilise them.  It is, therefore, really a matter of courtesy to protect reservists who are themselves protecting Ireland.<\/p><p>  Legislation alone does not work.  There must also be employer support and engagement.  It is not sufficient to oblige employers to release reservists for mobilisation and, possibly, training.  There must be engagement between the Department and employers.  This is generally done by all our comparator nations through consultative bodies which bridge the gap between defence and industry.  The establishment of such a group here was recommended in a military board report published in 1999.  To our detriment, however, this recommendation was never pursued.  Again, the White Paper may also address this matter.  It is important that employers understand that there are significant business benefits to employing reservists.  In that context, we learn practical skills, develop personality traits and obtain qualifications during our reserve service which have scalable value.  This position in this regard is outlined in reports relating to and produced by SaBRE, the UK's reservist organisation, which were compiled with the assistance of the Chartered Management Institute.  These reports scaled the cost attributed to reserve training in order to show employers how much that training is worth.  Employers in other nations are also rewarded for supporting and hiring reservists.  In Australia, for example, employers can claim up to $1,400 per week through an employer support payment scheme if they release their reservists for training and deployment.  Such is the importance of supporting employers, there is even an international conference on employer supports for reservists which is held on a biannual basis.  This conference is used to discuss research and experience in order to enhance reserve capability.  To date, however, Ireland has not participated in the conference.  We would like to hope that - going forward - it might be possible for us to consider attending.<\/p><p>  In the international context, all of our comparator nations classify reservists as part-time employees.  The Reserve Defence Force in this country prides itself on being a volunteer organisation.  Unfortunately, however, the removal of the annual gratuity and the policy of measured compulsory volunteerism has led to poor retention rates.  This explains why there is such a deficit among the lower level ranks at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200008#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rob Gilbey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415805600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The fundamental point is that this is not something new.

Training a person to be a reserve officer is worth &pound;22,000 to such an employer.  The British have placed a value on what is involved and this has given employers incentives and changed the perception in respect of reserve forces in the UK.

We welcome the opportunity to give our views on these important matters.  I also thank the committee for looking at the Office of the Ombudsman as a whole.  I am sure, as the Chairman has found by looking at the respective ombudsman schemes that we are different bodies, each with a different remit.  Some of us deal with stakeholders in the private sector, others in the public sector.  Some can only make recommendations but others, such as ourselves, make decisions that are legally binding.  Despite the fact that there are many differences, we have things in common, in particular as the committee looks at the respective roles of each of the ombudsmen, I would commend them very much to look at the guide to principles of good governance that have been put forward by the Ombudsman Association.  The Ombudsman Association is an association of the ombudsmen of the UK and Ireland.  All the various Irish ombudsmen are full participants and they look at very different ombudsman schemes - from the financial services ombudsman, the statutory ombudsman to the various private sector ombudsmen.  They deem there are certain principles such as independence and effectiveness that really are principles that should apply across the board.  It is very important for the committee to focus on those types of issues as they look across the ombudsman spectrum.<\/p><p>  I am here primarily to talk to the committee about the work of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  We were set up to be an alternative to the courts.  We are independent and impartial in resolving disputes.  Our particular jurisdiction is that we handle complaints by eligible consumers against regulated financial service providers.  This includes banks, building societies, insurance companies, intermediaries and a host of other providers, which are all regulated providers.<\/p><p>  We were set up in 2005 on a statutory basis as the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Prior to the establishment of the financial services ombudsman, there were voluntary schemes, set up by industry, such as a banking ombudsman, a credit institutions ombudsman and an insurance ombudsman.  Those roles were amalgamated and we were put on a statutory basis.<\/p><p>  We are a statutory officeholder who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers.  It is a requirement that before someone should come to us that he or she engages with the provider first.  The provider is required to inform the eligible consumer of our existence.  If the consumer is not satisfied with the resolution the financial service provider has given, he or she can then complain to us.<\/p><p>  The legislation that established us is the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  It provides that we should deal with complaints efficiently, effectively and fairly, that complaints should be dealt with in an informal and expeditious manner.  We are funded by a levy on the industry, not by the Exchequer, and consumers who make a complaint to us pay no fee and can do so free of charge.<\/p> <p> We operate in a larger institutional framework.  We adjudicate complaints based on principles made by others.  The principal basis on which we adjudicate cases is the consumer protection code and other regulations that are promulgated by the Central Bank.  We are also guided by legislation and general legal principles.  Our decisions are only binding on the parties in front of us.  We do not establish legal precedents.  That is not our job.  We are not a court.  We do not investigate financial service providers.  We do not investigate complainants.  If we come across an issue that we think is of systemic effect, we notify the Central Bank with which we have a very open and productive relationship.  It is up to the Central Bank as the regulator to make an investigation, if it wishes.  It has administrative powers.  It can issue fines and penalties.  We do not issue fines.  We do not award penalties.  We adjudicate individual complaints and we award compensation.<\/p><p> The Financial Services ombudsman is appointed by the Financial Services ombudsman&rsquo;s Council.  He is not a member of the council.  The council operates in a supervisory and advisory capacity.  It is a separate body.  It has no role with regard to how the ombudsman and the bureau deal with a particular complaint.  The ombudsman and the bureau are completely independent, not only of the stakeholders but also of the council.  We have been issuing a report about our complaints twice a year, our biannual review.  The latest one was issued for the second half of last year.  We have given the committee a copy of that review.  It tells a very important story about what has been happening in terms of complaints to our office in the past year.  By way of background, it is important to know that if one considers the financial crisis and the record of complaints before the ombudsman, between 2006 and 2009 the volume of complaints doubled and trebled.  That put a significant strain on the work of the office.  From 2009 to 2013 the complaints levelled off, broadly speaking.  Since the second half of last year, however, there has been a very significant reduction in the numbers of complaints of approximately 50%.<\/p><p> There are several reasons for this.  The complaints were driven by the financial crisis, by people often in very severe financial distress, for example, people who had lost money on their investments.  Complaints about investments in the past 18 months are down by approximately 90%.  We operate under a six-year rule of the Statute of Limitations.  In effect, the people who lost their money when the markets collapsed in 2008 have already made their complaints to us.  People who made their investments in 2009 or 2010 had, by and large, a very different outcome from those who made their investments in a previous period.  There are reductions in complaints across the board.  There are two reasons for that, the first of which is that we have changed our procedures to insist that complainants fully engage with providers before we adjudicate a complaint.  We have found that many people come to us prematurely before they have engaged with the financial provider and we tell them we are here for them if they are unhappy with the resolution the provider gives, but first they must deal with the provider.  They go to the provider and many do not come back to us.<\/p><p> Second, the legislation was changed in the second half of last year to give us the ability to issue reports on the complaint performance of individual financial service providers, and we did this in our first report which we published earlier this year.  It set out a fairly simple league table of the numbers of complaints upheld against financial service providers where during the relevant period, three or more complaints were upheld.  We did this according to the statutory instrument which sets out the way this must be done.<\/p><p> It has been our experience that this single report has had more influence on the behaviour of financial service providers than all the other decisions we had made in the first almost ten years of the office.  There is a renewed sense of engagement by providers, they are trying to settle more cases and are engaging with their customers at all stages in the process, from before the complaint is made to us to very advanced stages of investigation.  We, by and large, consider this to be a good thing because there can only be a settlement if both parties agree.  If someone is not happy with an offer made, that person is fully entitled to adjudicate to continue with the investigation and have us adjudicate the case.  We are very pleased to do that.<\/p><p> The committee has asked us several very specific questions.  I have dealt with some about the role and function of an ombudsman and the rights of citizens.  For us, it is very clear: citizens can make complaints to us if they are eligible consumers and they can do that free of charge.  Another question we were asked was whether the office of any ombudsman should be statutorily based and why.  I have to qualify my answer by saying that in terms of financial services we believe that it should be statutorily based because it means our decisions are legally binding.  Given the history of financial services and their importance, the public needs a manner of clear, effective redress and that can only be given if the body has binding legal powers.<\/p><p> If we turn to the broader network of ombudsmen, there are many voluntary schemes that are not based on statute that effectively provide a very good service.  They are forms of complaint handling.  Often their jurisdictional limit is quite small.  For some of the ombudsmen schemes dealing with telecommunications or other types of commercial services, the remit of the ombudsman may be only &euro;1,000 per complaint - relatively small - whereas ours is &euro;250,000.  Those schemes provide a valuable service.  They can be quite effective provided there is buy-in from the industry, and putting them on a statutory basis may not gain much more.  There are some areas, such as financial services, which because of their importance in people&rsquo;s lives and because it is one area where there is a great disparity in knowledge between the average consumer and the financial institution should be statutorily based.  We have learnt from dealing with people that many of them do not understand the nature of the products they have bought.  They do not understand their rights.  That cries out for the need for effective redress.<\/p><p> Another question is whether each ombudsman should be independently funded directly from the Central Fund.  We are not funded by the Exchequer.  We are funded by a levy on the industry.  That is entirely appropriate.  We inherited a voluntary scheme which was already funded by the industry.<\/p> <p>It is more appropriate for the industry to pay for it than the Exchequer.  Having said that, sometimes when we get letters from people who have made complaints and who are unhappy, they ask how they can expect anything else because we are funded by the industry.  It is very important that when a body is funded by a levy on the industry it has proper governance in place in order that it is independent.  In that sense, we are independent.  The levy is not imposed by the ombudsman or the bureau but by the council, which does it independently of us.  The council takes no part in deciding individual cases.  The independence of an ombudsman, if it is fully enshrined, is compatible with funding by the industry.<br\/>An important question is whether all public bodies should respect and implement in full recommendations made by the ombudsman arising from formal investigations by that ombudsman.  As I said previously, one can broadly separate the world of ombudsmen into two groups, namely, the public and the private ombudsmen.  The public ombudsmen, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or the statutory Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, deal with complaints against public bodies.  We deal with complaints against private bodies, which makes us significantly different.  Public bodies should have a buy-in to the ombudsman process.  If public bodies are able to ignore recommendations of the Ombudsman without giving any reason whatsoever, that obviously undermines its authority.  That is not to say that the Ombudsman is infallible but, clearly, in respect of the public ombudsmen, there must be some thought given to the integrity of their decisions.  We, however, are in a very different space.  We do not deal with public bodies but with private ones and our decisions are legally binding.  To that extent, our decisions can be fully and completely implemented by the parties concerned.  If, for example, a financial service provider does not implement one of our decisions, there are provisions in place which allow us to take the provider to court.  By and large, the only circumstances in which our decisions and findings are not implemented by the financial service provider are when that provider has gone out of business or into liquidation.  At that point, there is nothing that anyone can do in terms of enforcement.<br\/>On the question of the threshold for a government which wishes to reject a report from an ombudsman, this is something that the public ombudsmen would be better able to comment on rather than us.  The impartiality of the ombudsman is both a matter of fact and perception and the prestige of access to independent redress by citizens is also a matter of perception.  In that context, we have been asked for our views on how this should be strengthened.  Independence is at the absolute heart of what we must be.  If we are not independent, in both fact and perception, we cannot do our job.  Again, that is enshrined in legislation, as follows:<blockquote>The Financial Services Ombudsman is entitled to perform the functions imposed, and exercise the powers conferred, by this Act free from interference by any other person and, when dealing with a particular complaint, is required to act in an informal manner and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the complaint without regard to technicality or legal form.<\/blockquote>We believe that independence is extremely important.  We have to be able to investigate complaints free from all interference.  There are also very important governance aspects to the tenure of the ombudsman.  The Ombudsman Association argues that the recommended term of office should be a minimum of five years.  Everyone understands the importance of the independence of the Judiciary and we all accept that it must be free from any type of influence.  That is why judges are given, in many cases, lifetime tenure.  We are not asking for that but we believe that a minimum tenure of five years is appropriate, given the fact that we have a quasi-judicial function at the very least.  We also believe that the salary of the officeholder should be tied to a Civil Service grade and not simply a single salary point.<br\/>Effectiveness is also very important.  We must continue to have the necessary powers and ability to provide an aggrieved complainant with an adequate remedy.  As one looks across the spectrum of other ombudsmen, this is a question that must be focused on.  What can the other ombudsmen do to compensate an aggrieved party?  If they cannot do that, there is no incentive for anyone to make a complaint to them.  If an ombudsman is not getting complaints, then he or she is not really an ombudsman.  My office has a very wide jurisdiction to give a complainant effective relief.  If someone has made an investment and makes a case that he or she was mis-sold that investment, I have the legal powers to direct that the investment be returned to the financial service provider and the individual can get all of his or her money back, irrespective of jurisdictional limit.  That is a very clear-cut example of how we can give an individual an adequate remedy.  It is very important to look at this issue through that lens in the context of other ombudsmen.<br\/>The final question is whether all bodies and entities providing goods and services, whether delivered by the private or public sector, should be subject to the remit of the ombudsman.  The statutory Ombudsman has spoken about this and it is a question that is more relevant for him.  That said, we would agree with his position.  If services were provided by the public sector previously  - and under the public regime, a complaint could be made to the Ombudsman - the privatisation of those services provides no reason to deny aggrieved consumers the ability to access the Ombudsman.  It should not make any difference whether the service provider is in public or private ownership in terms of the public having access to an ombudsman scheme.<br\/>I am very happy to answer any further questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415809200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Prasifka and his team and thank them for appearing before this committee.  A number of thoughts struck me as I listened to Mr. Prasifka's opening statement, particularly on the broader ombudsman issues.  I have a particular interest in the Irish language and one of the points regularly made by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga relates directly to what Mr. Prasifka said, namely, that if an ombudsman cannot impose appropriate sanctions, then he or she is not really an ombudsman.  That is an issue which we will be discussing further with the language commissioner, who does not seem be enjoying the co-operation of various Departments and semi-State bodies because they do not see the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they do not do what he recommends.  He tries to cajole them and bring them along.  It is interesting to see that in the case of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the sanctions that can be imposed actually work.  The so-called name and shame table issued by the Financial Services Ombudsman seems to have worked very well and I applaud his office for that.  Many people believe that if financial institutions are not acting properly they should be named and shamed publicly.<\/p><p>  I note that there does not seem to be a large number of complaints relating to credit unions and I ask Mr. Prasifka to elaborate on that issue.  I apologise for not going through everything in detail but it appears to me that there seem to be more complaints made against the larger institutions in the financial services sector.<\/p> <p>Given that there have been a number of issues around some credit unions that have been amalgamated or have got into trouble, is there a reason there is not as much around that area?  Is the ombudsman happy with the powers he has or is there an extension of the remit that he would like?  The statutory Ombudsman has named a number of areas where it feels we should have jurisdiction in this area because we get complaints and we cannot deal them.  Are there particular areas from which the ombudsman receives a body of complaints but which are outside his remit and where he would be open to having the remit extended to cover them?  <\/p><p> Mr. Prasifka said that for the decisions to be legally binding it is important for the office of the Ombudsman to be statutorily based.  What discussions has he had with the Department and the relevant Ministers in this regard and what has been their response when he has sought these powers?<\/p><p> The health insurance industry is an area in which everybody gets mind boggled.  If one seeks to change one's policy from one provider to another, it is very difficult to compare and contrast the prices.  If Mr. Prasifka sees a body of complaints arriving around a particular matter, does he issue a recommendation that perhaps the industry should look at homogenising the way it presents the information to the consumer in order that it is easier to compare and contrast and, if so, what mechanisms are in place for changing the way financial services present their products and services and how successful has he been? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200005#E00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415809800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I will get a response to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200006#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1415809800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>May I ask one final question?

I agree completely with the Senator that the effectiveness of a remedy is the most important thing.  The ombudsman is there to decide individual complaints so the remedy must be there for the aggrieved party.  The ombudsman is not a regulator.  The office is not there to award a penalty or to issue a fine but to award compensation, to give a remedy to a person.  That is very important because if someone has no remedy, why should he or she make a complaint?  If one is not getting complaints, one is not in the business of being an ombudsman.  As the committee goes through the other ombudsmen, one has to ask what is there for a person to make a complaint?  For us, we have the full powers so maybe, in some regard. we are best in the class.  One has to look at it with that lens for other ombudsmen.<\/p><p>  The second point was about name and shame.  I can tell the committee it has been our experience that there are many financial institutions who are extremely concerned about potential reputational damage that may come to them by featuring prominently or, in some cases, featuring at all in our table.  To be in our table one has to have three or more complaints.  It is inevitable that for the largest institutions that they will always be there given the volume of business they do.  It is an important lesson.  We always had full legal powers.  We had full legal powers to award a good deal of compensation but for many institutions we only really got their attention when we had the ability to report on their individual performance.  There is a lesson there for some of the other ombudsmen.  <\/p><p>  In terms of credit unions, it is interesting to note that I am speaking to some people in the credit unions tomorrow so we have the number of complaints there to hand.  In the past couple of years, complaints about credit unions have averaged just under 1% of the total number of complaints.  This year, they are running at approximately 0.5%.  By any context, given the size of the business that is a very good performance.  Why is that?  We have looked at this for a number of years.  It is clear that its product portfolio is simpler, it is relationship based and community based.  Where one gets into trouble with people in the financial service providers is if there is no relationship.  So much of what we do is looking at whether there is a match-up between the product that is sold and the person who bought it.  If one is dealing with an institution which has the customer today, has had them for a number of years, and hopes to have them for the rest of their life, and if they are relationship based they will know the customer better and are more interested in selling them products that will make them want to come back.  We think those are very important issues.  We receive relatively few complaints about credit unions.  Perhaps that is something they should speak about more and it is to their advantage.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked if we need any additional powers.  On a broad level, the answer is \"No\".  We have full powers.  In terms of our proposed amalgamation with the pensions ombudsman, we have been looking at the powers of the pensions ombudsman versus the powers that we have and we have found a few anomalies.  For example, when the pensions ombudsman does an investigation, it has the power to compel third parties to give it information if it deems it relevant to its investigation of a complaint.  We only have the power to compel the financial service provider for information.  Often, what happens in, say, the case of an investment product is that the sale is made by a financial adviser who is the agent of the financial service provider and that person has left the company.  We have taken legal advice on this issue.  We have no power to compel that person to give us information or to appear if we have an oral hearing.  Sometimes that is the critical witness and we have no power in that area.  As we are looking at amending the legislation, that may be one area where we would look for additional powers.<\/p><p>  The Senator raised the issue of health insurance.  We deal with health insurance on a daily basis.  We had noticed there was an increase in health insurance complaints going back three and four years ago.  This was understandable because the market was becoming more complicated.  We had gone from a position of one or two providers to more providers.  There were different types of policies and it was clear that a number of complaints were driven by the fact that people did not really understand the coverage they had or the coverage they were getting.  We did have a number of complaints in this area. This is one where we make the individual decisions.  If we think there are any systemic issues we refer them to the Central Bank but we are not there to give industry guidelines.  That is not our job.  Our job is to adjudicate individual complaints.  Hopefully the industry will learn from that but in terms of further regulations, industry guidelines, these are issues for the regulator and not for ourselves. <\/p><p>  The Senator's last question was how I think the committee could be of benefit to us.  I welcome the committee looking at the ombudsman's spectrum across all of us.  What I would like to see the committee do is to look at the principles of good governance of the Ombudsman Association in the context of each ombudsman.  How are they living up to that?  Are they effective?  Are they independent?  If not, why not, and how can they be made better?  That is how I think they be of benefit to us.<\/p> <p>I am well aware that while we have full powers, many of our fellow ombudsmen do not.  There is a useful role for the committee in examining those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Prasifka and his colleagues for their very clear presentation.  I apologise if the answers to any of my questions were included in the annual report of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and I simply could not find them.  Mr. Prasifka expressed the view that the levy is the appropriate way to fund his office rather than direct Exchequer funding.  Without meaning in any way to impugn the work the delegates do, there is always the possibility that some people will say that because the office is being paid for by the industry, it might not be as independent as one would like.  Have the delegates found that any of their members are reluctant to pay the levy and, if so, what recourse does the office have, or is this not really an issue?<\/p><p>  Most of the other ombudsmen who have appeared before the committee observed that they often encounter delays in getting information from Departments and other bodies and experience a level of non-co-operation.  Where they make findings, we were told, there is sometimes a problem with their implementation and, in some cases, they are just plain ignored.  I note that the delegates' annual report makes no reference to any of these types of problems.  This might mean they are not experiencing such difficulties or it could be that they are just not referred to in the report.  Will Mr. Prasifka clarify that?<\/p><p>  The Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman offers the right to mediation, but only a very small number of cases have ended up in mediation and only six were resolved by that route.  Is this low rate because mediation is still a very new process or is it simply the case that it does not work in many instances?  Does Mr. Prasifka have an observation on the role of mediation in general?  As a society, it is surely something we ought to embrace more widely.  I am pleased the option is there, albeit on a small scale.  Perhaps the intention is to expand it.  If a complainant is dissatisfied with the ombudsman's findings, is that the end of the line or does he or she have the right of appeal to the ombudsman?<\/p><p>  Mr. Prasifka indicated that where a matter is found to be of systemic concern, his office will refer it to the Central Bank.  Does that happen often?  Mr. Prasifka observed that his office has a good and open relationship with the Central Bank.  If information on referrals is not included in the annual report, does he agree it should it be included in the interests of transparency?  If the office is discovering issues that have a systemic quality, should it not report them and say it has done so?<\/p><p>  Mr. Prasifka noted that the Financial Services Ombudsman office is not obliged to feed into the setting up of rules or guidelines.  Is there a relationship, either formal or informal, with the regulator whereby the office can feed in its expertise and findings, or do the delegates expect the regulator to read what they have done and take its own findings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Regarding the levy, I acknowledge the public perception issue that might arise from the fact that we are effectively funded by the industry.  The difficulty is that the choices are rather stark in this regard.  Would it be better to have the office funded directly by the taxpayer?  I have said that the levy is effectively paid for by the industry, but it is really paid for by customers as well.  It is a cost of doing business.  Best international practice in this area is for bodies like ours to be paid for by the industry, that is, by the people who are using the financial services products that are being regulated.  However, as I said, there is the danger that people will deem us to be not independent, which is why we must have proper structures of governance in place.  It is very important that the ombudsman is seen to be clearly independent.<\/p><p>  Regarding our ability to collect the levy, the only issue we have in this regard is with very small providers.  Our remit covers everything from the largest financial institutions, banks and insurance companies down to two-person operations providing intermediary or broker services.  During the contraction of recent years, many of those smaller providers went out of business.  There is no real issue in terms of collecting the levy from 98% plus of the bodies we regulate.  We are dealing with regulated financial service providers - companies which must have the licence - and that puts them into a separate category.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked whether we experience any element of non-co-operation when it comes to implementing our findings.  As I said, our findings are legally binding and are generally implemented.  The only exception we have found is in circumstances where a company goes out of business and is in liquidation or receivership.  In such cases we would be in contact with the receiver.  The Senator is correct that there is no reference to this issue in our annual report.  That is because it is not really an issue for us.  It is only an issue where parties go out of business, but at that point nobody can collect a judgment against them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Does what Mr. Prasifka is saying also apply to the way in which companies co-operate with the ombudsman's office in terms of coming before it, providing paperwork and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Sometimes, by the time a complaint is made to us, the company is already in liquidation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I was referring not to companies in liquidation but ongoing concerns with which the ombudsman's office is dealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00600","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>We have specific timelines within which we expect companies to engage with us, and most concur with those timelines.

When I say \"mediation\" I am referring to formal mediation where both parties come into our office and meet with our staff members who are trained as mediators and can work to facilitate agreement.  We are required, under the legislation, to offer mediation, but it can only happen where both parties consent to it.  Many providers are not willing to give that consent because, in their view, they have already made their case and, in some cases, have already made a settlement offer.  They are not willing to go any further.<\/p><p>  Having said that, the incidence of settlements has been increasing in recent years.  \"Settlement\" simply means the parties talking to each other, which we encourage.  I always make the point in regard to mediation that we fully understand it is never going to be a means of resolving most or a large number of cases.  By the time complaints have been made, positions have hardened.  Mediation will only take place when both parties come forward with a willingness to compromise and meet somewhere in the middle.  However, I tell providers every time I see them that there is scope for more than one mediation per month.  Many of the companies that have availed of it have found it to be beneficial.  It is a means of resolving those cases where parties are willing to compromise.  The take-up is not that high but, as I said, more cases are being settled, which is a good thing.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked where people can go if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of their appeal and whether we have an internal mechanism for dealing with such cases.<\/p> <p>The simple answer is that there is no internal mechanism.  The courts have stated our findings are legally binding.  If either party, the complainant or the financial service provider, is dissatisfied, they can appeal to the courts.  That is where they have to go.<\/p><p> In response to the question about systemic concern and how we report to the Central Bank, we have a very open relationship and meet it formally every quarter and copies of findings go directly to it from time to time, which raises issues.

We have a memorandum of understanding with it, which allows us to exchange information on a broad range of issues.  We are the Ombudsman and the Central Bank is the regulator.  The Ombudsman can be a very good early warning system, particularly during turbulent times.  We see many issues before others would.  All of our information feeds into the Central Bank which can use it for a variety of means.  It can use it to prioritise where it will work and carry out investigations; it can even assist it in identifying areas of concern and certain financial service providers.  At the end of the day, it is up to the regulator.

In some respects, the financial providers have an advantage over the consumer because they know us and have a record, many of the larger ones would have very extensive dealings with us and if a complaint was made, they would have a very good idea if it would be upheld.

We must have the same methodology.  There are a couple of reasons we do not uphold more complaints, one of which is that many complaints are driven by people in financial distress; they simply do not have the money and this may be their last throw of the dice and their only means of dealing with the issue.  We hope that as the economy begins to improve and more people are working, there will be fewer people in financial distress.  That would help to reduce complaint levels.  The second reason is that it is quite obvious to us that there are many people who do not fully understand the products they have bought, how they work or what their rights are; therefore, they make a complaint to us and we consider it independently.  We have a very experienced and well trained staff who are engaged in continuous education, many of whom have many years of experience in the area and are familiar with the various products on offer and policies in place and can give people an independent view of their rights.  I have always believed it is a very important service that we provide, to give people at least the reassurance that someone with experience and expertise has considered their issues.<\/p> <p>I have been in this job almost five years and my experience is that we get very few frivolous complaints.  Many people do not understand the products they have and we provide the service of explaining such products and clearly explaining rights.

Regarding complaints that are not upheld, I take the point about people not understanding the products they bought.  Some people might say financial service providers should take greater responsibility to explain things properly.  People may not be fully informed of matters covered in small print.<\/p><p>  I wonder about the burden of proof in disputed situations and how it works.  Must a person making a complaint against a service provider prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complaint is justified or is it decided on the balance of probability?  I know of cases where people made complaints to a financial institution relating to decisions perceived as unfair.  As far as I was concerned the complainants were honest and the complaints were true but the bank simply said \"you cannot prove it so tough luck\".  In one case the person was a long-standing customer of a financial institution and there was not enough money at stake for anyone to believe the customer was playing fast and loose with the institution to make a few bob.  However, the customer could not absolutely prove the case.

Mr. Prasifka described what a product is and it could be an insurance policy.  I have encountered cases where people thought they had bought life assurance but after a spouse died they learned that exclusion clauses may mean one type of heart condition is covered and another is not.  I am confident that these people were not aware of the distinctions and that they were not explained.  People must disclose treatments and conditions when taking out policies but, assuming this is done correctly, do many people make complaints about unfair exclusion clauses in life assurance policies?  Has the Financial Services Ombudsman had success overturning decisions by life assurance companies not to indemnify on the death of a spouse?<\/p><p>  Motor insurance is a topical issue, unfortunately, in my county of Mayo and the same applies elsewhere in the country.  Hundreds of cars have been destroyed in Mayo due to petrol stretching and contaminated petrol and I understand that third party, fire and theft insurance does not cover such damage.  However, a number of affected people with comprehensive insurance have brought to my attention the fact that insurance companies have been slow to indemnify in such circumstances, though an assessor may be sent quickly.  Has the Financial Services Ombudsman had complaints in this regard or relating to diesel laundering, though the latter may have less influence on the operation of a vehicle?<\/p><p>  I have received many complaints relating to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I know the transactions involved are substantial and the people involved may not have recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman but can Mr. Prasifka envisage his office taking a role in such complaints?  NAMA is all-powerful and it is touting for joint venture and loans business in the area of development so I wonder whether it could fall under the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  I would be relieved if the Financial Services Ombudsman could deal with NAMA.  What is Mr. Prasifka's view on this?  NAMA is expanding its remit and giving money for development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200009#J00600","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415811600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The first question related to our experience dealing with exclusion clauses and this is something we do on an everyday basis.  We fully understand the difficulty that some people face as they believe that when they buy a critical illness policy and something happens, they will get paid.  People learn, on reading policies, that only certain types of illness are covered and some of the definitions are very technical.  We go through these matters on a case-by-case basis and we first examine what the contract says.<\/p> <p>In terms of disclosures, the common law rule in Ireland is one of <i>uberrima fides<\/i>.  The contract of insurance is one of utmost good faith.  There is an obligation of disclosure but there is also an obligation on the financial service provider to ask the right questions.  We have had a number of cases where financial service providers were claiming non-disclosure in circumstances where they had simply failed to ask the relevant questions properly or clearly enough in order to place the burden back onto the customer.  This is a matter with which we deal all the time.  Ultimately, what we want to happen is not for us to be obliged to uphold more complaints but rather for standards to be raised.  What needs to be done in some of these areas is that more information must be provided at point of sale so that people will be better informed when they are buying the product.  That is why we are taking some degree of satisfaction from an overall drop in the number of complaints, particularly if this is an indication that standards are improving.  One element of better performance is for providers to settle more cases after complaints have been made.  An even better way of dealing with the situation is to obviate the need for people to make complaints as a result of providers changing their practices.  We have seen some progress in this regard.  We take a very firm view that the burden must be on the provider to ask the correct questions and to do this in a way that is understandable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200009#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415812200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>How was this demonstrated to Mr. Prasifka's office?

This does not mean that we have not dealt with such cases but I believe there would be fewer than a handful of them.
