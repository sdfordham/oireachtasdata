The overall aim of the strategy is to develop a world-class integrated system of further education and training in Ireland which will promote economic development and meet the needs of all citizens.  The strategy was developed by SOLAS, the further education and training authority, which was established in 2013 to develop and give strategic direction to the further education sector.<br\/>To brief the committee on the strategy and how it is being taken forward, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Paul O'Toole, Ms Fiona Hartley and Dr. Bryan Fields representing SOLAS, the further education and training authority, Mr. Michael Moriarty and Mr. Paddy Lavelle representing Education and Training Boards Ireland, Dr. Kara McGann representing IBEC and Dr. Peter Rigney representing ICTU.

We look forward to contributing to the committee's discussion and addressing any questions that members may have about the role of SOLAS in the implementation of this strategy.  SOLAS was established in October 2013 on foot of the Further Education and Training Act 2013, section 9 of which provides that SOLAS will prepare and submit a strategy in respect of further education and training to the Minister for Education and Skills every five years.  The Minister may approve the strategy with or without modifications, or may refuse to approve the strategy.  The first such strategy was submitted for consideration to the then Minister on 31 March 2014 in accordance with the agreed timeline for this initial proposed strategy.  The Minister formally approved the strategy on 24 April 2014.<\/p><p>  SOLAS is tasked with ensuring the provision of high-quality further education and training programmes which are responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changed and changing economy.  This mandate will be delivered in conjunction with all of our partners, particularly the education and training boards, which are our principal partners.  For the purposes of the strategy, further education and training programmes are defined as comprehending up to level 6 of the national framework of qualifications and where funding is provided by SOLAS through the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills.  These programmes embrace a vast range of courses which provide entry level, intermediate and technical skills as well as programmes which assist in personal development and support people who suffer various forms of disadvantage or disability.  Apprenticeships are an example of effective further education and training provision.  I am aware that the committee has examined the future approach to this aspect of provision.<\/p><p>  The strategy provides a focus for the setting of further education and training investment priorities and a framework for the establishment and development of a strong further education and training sector.  It aims to deliver a higher quality learning experience, leading to better outcomes for everyone who engages in further education and training.  In turn, this will support economic development and increase social inclusion.  SOLAS consulted widely with stakeholders in developing the strategy, which is set in the context of Government reform of public services.  This consultation included representatives from employer bodies, higher and further education and training providers, community and other representative bodies, trade unions and, vitally, learners themselves.  An evidence-based approach was applied though collaboration with the ESRI, which has carried out extensive research nationally and internationally.  This research has been published by the ESRI in a companion document, Further Education and Training in Ireland: Past, Present and Future.<\/p><p>  Strategic goals have been identified for the further education and training sector in five areas: skills for the economy, active inclusion, quality provision, integrated planning and funding, and the standing of further education and training.  The goal under the heading of skills for the economy is that further education and training will address the current and future skills needs of learners, jobseekers and employees, meet the skills needs of enterprise and employers and contribute to national economic development.  The goal under the heading of active inclusion is that further education and training provision will support the active inclusion of people of all abilities in society, with special reference to literacy and numeracy in accordance with the legislation which established SOLAS.  The goal under the heading of quality provision is that further education and training will provide high-quality education and training programmes and will meet appropriate national and international quality standards.  The goal under the heading of integrated planning and funding is that further education and training provision will be planned and funded on the basis of objective needs and evidence of social and economic impact.  The goal under the heading of the standing of further education and training is to ensure a valued learning path leading to agreed employment, career, developmental, personal and social outcomes.<\/p><p>  Following the approval of the strategy by the Minister of Education and Skills, a detailed whole-of-sector implementation plan that sets out over 50 actions required to implement the strategy has been developed in consultation with the Departments of Education and Skills; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and Social Protection.  SOLAS will lead on more than 50% of the actions which have been identified and the balance will be led by a number of Departments and other bodies.  A large number of stakeholder organisations are being asked to contribute to the achievement of each action as appropriate.  A new strategy implementation advisory committee has been established to review progress on the implementation of the strategy and provide advice to SOLAS.  It is being chaired by the Department of Education and Skills and its membership includes representatives of each main group of delivery stakeholders.  A mechanism to ensure the voice of learners is heard is being developed and will be implemented to ensure this vital group of stakeholders will have an opportunity to participate in the evolution of the further and education sector.<\/p><p>  SOLAS will report progress on a quarterly basis to its board, to the Minister for Education and Skills and publicly.  SOLAS acknowledges the fine work carried out by many providers in the development and evolution of the further education and training sector over many years.  We believe these providers and the existing provision form a solid basis to move forward.  Nevertheless, the objective evidence which is available points to the need to refocus and reinvigorate the sector.  Further education and training programmes give many people, most of whom are adults, an opportunity to develop their potential in a manner which best supports the achievement of their personal learning goals and their preferred approach to learning.  A coherent plan that seeks to synergise the many strands which encompass further education and training today has an ethos of continuous improvement and is based on objective, non-partisan evaluation of how individual further education and training programmes achieve against their stated objectives, deliver better outcomes and experiences for learners and significantly enhance the contribution of further education and training to the economy and society.  The principal challenge for all the stakeholders in further education and training is to drive forward the implementation of this strategy.  A sea change is required in how we value, promote, deliver, assess and continually improve further education and training programmes.  SOLAS intends to play a full and constructive part in this implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1415797500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Michael Moriarty of Education and Training Boards Ireland to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415797500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>As the Chairman and the members of the committee will be aware, the intention behind the establishment of the education and training boards and SOLAS in 2013 was to provide for better co-ordination and delivery of education and training, leading to the development of a world-class integrated system of further education and training in Ireland.  Under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, the role of each education and training board is to \"plan, provide, co-ordinate and review the provision of education and training ... in its functional area\".  As we have heard, the role of SOLAS is to have responsibility for the strategic co-ordination and funding of the further education and training sector.  The further education and training strategy that was mentioned by Mr. O'Toole, which was published in May 2014, provides a roadmap for this process.  As the main statutory authorities delivering further education and training, education and training boards and their representative body, Education and Training Boards Ireland, have significant roles to play in realising that strategy.<\/p><p>  A key part of the successful implementation of the strategy will be the provision of the capacity and resources to manage the delivery of training and education efficiently.  If the strategy is to fulfil its mission, education and training boards need appropriate structures and supports and adequate resourcing.  The detailed implementation plan for the further education and training strategy sets out how the education and training boards will assist in the fulfilment of the goals identified in that strategy.  I would like to mention some of the 13 actions, from the total of 53 identified in the plan, that relate to Education and Training Boards Ireland and the education and training boards themselves.  We will be responsible for modifying further education and training provision in accordance with the skills needs of industry; reflecting direct employer involvement in designing courses; providing education and training in entrepreneurship, which is something we hope to do next year; developing appropriate further education and training interventions and supports for active inclusion; ensuring an effective support service that identifies education and training needs and matches them to the needs of industry is available for all learners who need it; developing a co-ordinated programme of continuing professional development; developing a further education and training customer charter; ensuring there is effective continuing professional development; developing partnerships with further education support services, curriculum development units and other agencies and bodies locally and nationally; and devising and implementing an integrated guidance strategy in association with SOLAS.<\/p><p>  Education and Training Boards Ireland has identified a number of concerns regarding possible impediments or roadblocks to the achievement of these actions.  While I am sure these issues will be addressed, it is important to place details of them on the record.  A strategy is needed to address salary scales and career structure development for the tutors who deliver further education.  They need a proper career structure in this sector.  The further education and training sector now stands shoulder to shoulder with the first, second and third level sectors, but it needs the same focus.  It needs to be professionalised.  The professionalisation of the role of tutors is one of the key ways of doing this.  This sector also needs a capital budget for building improvement works, as it is the only one of the four sectors I mentioned that does not have such a budget.  While the recruitment moratorium does not affect front-line services, it certainly affects the support staff we have.  That is critical, as is the guidance strategy.  A proper, effective and well-resourced adult guidance service needs to be in place to make sure the most marginalised people, including those in the most difficult circumstances and the long-term unemployed, are directed in the right direction in terms of their future skills needs.<\/p><p>  One of the means by which SOLAS supports the delivery of integrated further education and training by the education and training boards is by allocating funding to those boards.<\/p> <p>This funding includes the cost of running the former training centres which have transferred to the ETBs which are constituted from the old VECs and the F&Aacute;S training division.  They are providing integration of further education and training at local level within the catchment area.  This is a significant advantage in terms of customer identification with education and training boards.<\/p><p> We continue to hold high-level meetings with our colleagues in SOLAS and there is a collaborative approach at national level in respect of the implementation plan for the further education and training strategy.  The putting in place of funding agreements ensures that ETBs retain ownership over their own local planning but within national guidelines while ensuring there is consistency in quality across the regions.<\/p><p> Underpinning the further education and training, FET, strategy is a commitment by ETBs and SOLAS to establishing an appropriate advisory infrastructure so that provision is informed directly by employers and responds to emerging needs at both national and local level as well as a commitment to develop and provide new courses and programmes that are quality assured and adhere to the relevant awarding body quality system.  There is also a commitment to advance the recommendations of the apprenticeship review and to establish new models of work-based learning within further education and training, FET.  Education and Training Board Ireland, ETBI and ETBs will continue to collaborate with SOLAS to achieve the aims of the FET strategy and to advance the actions listed in the implementation plan.  However, it is imperative that adequate resourcing and funding are put in place to allow ETBs to fulfil both those commitments and their mandate as set out in the Further Education and Training Boards Act 2013.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I thank the members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the provisions contained in the FET strategy in which ETBI and our member ETBs are centrally involved.   My colleague and I will be happy to respond to questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415798100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on an important issue for the business sector.  IBEC is pleased to have been a member of both the further education and training strategy advisory group and the group that is currently overseeing its implementation.  Therefore, we are very familiar with the detailed planning that has gone into the development of the strategy.  We also the welcome the commitment of the strategy's architects, notably SOLAS, to engage with business.<\/p><p>  This is an extremely ambitious and challenging strategy that seeks to rebuild the entire further education and training sector.  It gives priority, quite correctly in our view, to the requirement to provide people with the skills and education to enable them to compete for sustainable work.  However, its success will be ultimately judged by how it delivers.  All too often, the reconfiguration of institutions and policy rhetoric at national level bear little relationship to what is happening on the ground.  We need to be realistic about the significant implementation challenges.  This is a complex and diverse sector that has not, it is generally agreed, received the attention it deserves from policymakers in the past.  We are unable to comment in detail on a 158-page strategy document in a five minute input.  Therefore, I will highlight where we believe the most significant challenges exist from a business perspective.<\/p><p>  The strategy quite correctly emphasises the importance of aligning further education and training with the skills needs of employers.  Local labour market demand is more likely to be anticipated through intensive interaction between education training providers and the enterprise.  As the OECD has pointed out, there is an inevitable tendency for vocational programmes rooted in education institutions to develop their own dynamic, independent of the world of work and unresponsive to rapid change in the needs of the economy.  To ensure that the FET system is not supply driven, it is critical that the business community is strongly represented at both national and, more particularly, at local level.<\/p><p>  Apart from the local labour market intelligence which employers bring, they can also provide a specific perspective on the type of employability skills that can be developed through the curriculum.  For example, in recruiting unemployed people for entry level positions we know that employers want evidence that candidates have the aptitudes and soft skills that will enable them to learn what their job entails, adapt to the company's organisational culture and get on with colleagues.  However, we should not underestimate the complexities and challenges of connecting with a highly heterogeneous business sector in which almost 47% of total employment is provided by firms with fewer than 50 employees.  This is a business environment that is constantly changing.  In order to engage meaningfully, we need integrated regional structures which bring together employers, FET, higher education, enterprise development agencies and the local Intreo service.<\/p><p>  IBEC is constantly struck by how the different components of our education system work in silos.  FET has a critical function in providing access and progression routes for individuals to continue their studies at institutes of technology or universities.  The committee will be aware that the Higher Education Authority is also working on the development of regional clusters of different types of education institutions.  The clusters have the potential to play a key role in the development of industry networks and to provide clear regional pathways for individuals who want to progress through the education system, but we do not hear the voice of further education and training sufficiently in these discussions.  Given the economic circumstances, it is not surprising that a lot of attention in the development of the strategy was on the relationship between FET and labour market activation.  However, the sector has a critical role in meeting the needs of people in employment.<\/p><p>  Ireland's economic recovery depends on the skills and flexibility of its labour market.  There is a particularly important cohort of individuals currently in employment which is precarious or where skills are becoming obsolete.  They also require upskilling or retraining if they are to retain their jobs and their employer is to remain viable or competitive.  It is important that provision is made for them.  To meet the needs of diverse learners with diverse schedules it is important that a range of programme delivery methods are offered.  This will offer benefits in terms of costs and flexibility of access, but will also require significant preparation in advance by those delivering the programmes.  As important is the flexibility around when courses are delivered and examined it does not always suit to have strict adherence to an academic year and so flexibility is also required in this regard.<\/p><p>  Last July, IBEC provided evidence to the joint committee on the new apprenticeship model.  At the time we referred to the reality that apprenticeships and vocational education in general do not enjoy the parity of esteem in a society that defines educational achievement in terms of CAO points.  This strategy offers an opportunity to address this challenge.  Its successful implementation will enable FET providers to equip learners with the necessary skills to take up sustainable, high quality and fulfilling employment.  In this way, it will become a highly sought-after education option for both young people and adult learners.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC's views on this important initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kara McGann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415798100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation.  Like my colleague from IBEC, I made a presentation last July on the question of apprenticeships.  In ICTU's view, one of the key components of the strategy would be the development of a broadened and modern apprenticeship model for our economy.  This is the responsibility of the newly established apprenticeship advisory council which will be launched next week.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that we have just emerged from our first European semester since our exit from the troika and we have received a recommendation on the development of a modernised apprenticeship system.  I suspect we will be given a recommendation along these lines in the country-specific recommendations for next year.  At European level, the EU Council has called for open pathways and parity of esteem between vocational education and training and general higher education.  This call is articulated in the Copenhagen declaration and is based on research conducted over a decade by CEDEFOP, the European Centre for Research and Vocational Training.  Many of the issues we face in Ireland are in fact Europe-wide issues.<\/p><p>  The priorities of the further education sector in Ireland must reflect the priorities of the ESF which is one of the major sources of funding.  These priorities are, first, to combat long-term unemployment by ensuring that individuals can access employment via in-demand skills development, together with improving the qualification levels of lower skilled longer-term unemployed; second, to support those young people not in education, employment or training, NEETs, to participate in programmes which include work experience with labour market relevance; and, third, to increase social inclusion by targeting interventions with appropriate ongoing supports.  These are reflected in the three drivers of training developed by SOLAS which are the labour market, social inclusion and lifelong learning.<\/p><p>  I was a member of the committee that helped to draw up the SOLAS training strategy and I am fully committed to it as part of what I consider to be collective responsibility.  Each of the three areas I mentioned will have differing metrics, reflecting the divergent needs of their client populations.  One of the first tasks of SOLAS has been to put credible metrics in place, in co-operation with all the stakeholders.<\/p><p>  As other speakers said, the further education sector now represents the ETBs and the F&Aacute;S training centres and in our view, it should absorb what is best in both bodies and cultures in terms of corporate culture and operational models.  A key aspect of the system which is being developed must be the development of work-based learning including the development of tools for monitoring the work-based element of the learning.  This will need to go beyond the informality which surrounds much of education-based work experience.  Perhaps part of the price we pay for a modern quality apprenticeship system is a lessening of the requirement for work experience in other areas of the education system, lessening the requirement on employers in exchange for the rolling out of apprenticeships in other areas.<\/p><p>  It has frequently been said that SOLAS will be to the ETBs what the HEA is to the universities and the institutes of technology.  We agree that there is a need for a national body to steer a national policy.  One of the strongest aspects that SOLAS brings to bear is its evaluative skills and its skills in labour market forecasting contained in its skills and labour market research unit.  One of the key issues for the sector in the future will be labour market contact and labour market relevance.<\/p> <p>An underpinning value of further education must be the credibility of the awards.  Awards are like currency; they are pieces of paper which, of themselves, are intrinsically worthless but on which society conveys a worth by virtue of what they signify.  Citizens must be certain that the standards set by QQI are consistent.  We must also be satisfied that when problems arise, as they have done in the past, they are fully examined and lessons are learned.<br\/>As stated, a problem faced in the further education sector is one of parity of esteem.  This has been identified at European level.  Frankly and simply put, this means some FE courses are not regarded as highly as higher education courses, even though the FE courses concerned might have better completion rates and employment outcomes than the HE courses.  The challenge for Ireland is to overcome this problem of perception and to name and challenge the organisational behaviour which fosters this perception.<br\/>If there is one thing I want to stress in my presentation, it is that the overwhelming issue for us is the development of a modernised apprenticeship system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415798700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today to discuss the strategy.  I have a few comments on which I would like them to come back.  Everybody touched on the importance of ensuring the further education sector is matched in relation to the employment side of its objectives to ensure it meets future demand.  On the apprenticeship side, the most recent figures show that between painters-decorators and bricklayers, there was a total of ten apprentices in the system and we expect that sector to grow over the coming years.  It is relevant to the apprenticeship strategy but it signifies the difficulties in the system in terms of ensuring it meets future demand and that it is not constantly trying to play catch up.  I would be interested to hear any further comments from the witnesses in relation to how they believe the further education strategy for the next five years, as published, can do that and what are the chances we can ensure it will work in a way that ensures it meets demand as opposed to being driven by supply, as was the case in the past.<\/p><p>  There was a two point increase in the previous budget in the pupil-teacher ratio in the further education sector.  I would be interested to hear feedback from the witnesses on any feedback they have had from within the sector as to the impact it has had and whether that is something which needs to be addressed to ensure the five year strategy can meet its objectives.<\/p><p>  Mr. Moriarty mentioned the issue of guidance.  I would be interested to hear the views of all the witnesses in relation to the importance of proper guidance and on people entering the system and on ensuring people take up courses and go down avenues which appropriately meet their needs.  There are big gaps in the system and if the new strategy is to work properly, it cannot be done without a proper guidance provision system.  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on the adequacy of the current set up and what exactly we require to complement the objectives of the strategy.<\/p><p>  I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses from SOLAS and ETBI on the amalgamation of the training centres with the ETBI, on how that is going and if there are challenges there which remain to be met and how that fits into the achievement of the strategy's objectives.

It is an ambitious programme and, with any ambitious programme, there is a need for not only for a shift in terms of people's attitudes, but for investment.  One of the investments, for instance, deals with the requirements of business and the STEM subjects if we are to provide the best possible opportunity and education for those who are availing of courses.  Are the witnesses confident that the resources are there?  What are the resources required to bring all of the centres and courses, in particular, the STEM courses, that have been identified up to a level comparable with international standards?  That is in terms of resources for labs and so on.<\/p><p>  There is also a resource issue in terms of teachers.  Deputy McConalogue mentioned the PLCs.  There has been a drop-off in numbers because of the pupil-teacher ratio.  If we are to deliver the best possible opportunity, there is a requirement that classes are not too full and that those being trained or taught get the best possible outcome from the course of which they are availing rather than being in overloaded classes, which is a factor in the rest of the education system.  What is happening in relation to delivering courses, which are not oversubscribed?  I know of some colleges which have taken on extra pupils over and above the numbers required to ensure that the colleges can survive. <\/p><p>  I refer to the change from F&Aacute;S centres to education and training board centres.  I do not think utilisation of many of the centres is at its fullest.  We have centres which have fully fitted out training rooms for electricians, plumbers and so on.  I tabled parliamentary questions recently and found some have been vacant for a long time.  One of the questions I asked was about a course I was promised was due to start, which leads me on to a follow up question.  Will the courses be delivered by directly employed trainers from the ETBs or will they be subcontracted out?  There is a danger that a course could be subcontracted out to an organisation which is for profit rather than for education and that there would be difference in the ethos and possibly the outcome.  <\/p><p>  The question of the move towards working all year round would be a major one for Dr. Rigney, who represents ICTU, which would include the TUI and other unions.  What is the current position?  Have there been negotiations with the unions, the teachers and the trainers or is it just one of those ideas put out which, all of a sudden, ends up on top of us very quickly without the background work being done?  It would be a huge change for some teachers, although others are trainers and work all year round anyway.  If we amalgamate both sectors, there will be major difficulties, including human resource difficulties, union difficulties and difficulties for people who have had a different holiday arrangements, etc., and who would have to change their lives to cater for children and so on.

Here we have approximately 25, many of which are related to the construction area.  In what direction do the delegates intend to expand apprenticeships beyond construction, plumbing and electrical work?  I do not see lists of these.  There have been many reports, including from the Forestry Service of Ireland and heritage and conservation bodies.  There have been many suggestions on apprenticeships.  Have any of those come to the fore?  Are any apprenticeships being expanded or put into place?  There is a lot more to be done than just electrical work and plumbing, which of course are terribly important.

The idea that the BA is the only way forward in education is crazy.  People need skills and want to be able to do things; it is not that a BA does not allow one to do things.  The vocational education sector was the first sector in which I taught as a teacher.  Vocational education is a marvellous method of education but we seem to have lost it along the way towards academic education.  We have heard many people stating they just want to get to university but sometimes vocational education is appropriate.  Vocational education is now returning as a means of training young people, especially those who have been unemployed for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200006#G00400","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415799300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad so I will allow the delegates to respond immediately.

One of the first acts of the group will be a call to enterprise to put forward its suggestions on where it can usefully provide apprenticeship-type opportunities.<\/p><p>  To get to the heart of the Senator's question, people learn in different ways.  In the broadest sense, further education and training recognises that people start from different places and can best develop their potential if supported to do so in the right way.  The system works when a person can learn required skills on the job in the work environment, supported by State investment in the formal aspects of the training or education.  In the broadest sense, that is what the new apprenticeship council will seek to do.  There is an existing range of 25 apprenticeships, which have been very successful down the years.  There will be a call to expand that.<\/p><p>  Apprenticeship in Ireland represents a statutorily based function and is defined as such.  It is interpreted differently in different countries around Europe, and we know that.  We have developed a range of traineeships that have the feature of on-the-job learning, supported by State off-the-job learning.  There is a range of other disciplines, including secretaryships.  To get the core of the point, there is an opportunity associated with, and a value attached to, increasing the range of combined dual-approach learning programmes on and off the job.  We expect that the new call to action in this regard will yield benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1415799300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>There were 76 submissions to the former Minister from sectors all over Ireland, including the forestry and conservation sectors, and also those associated with electronics, tax and business.

The two central planks of the further education and training strategy involve combining an approach that recognises the need to develop skills for the economy &mdash; enterprise-facing skills &mdash; with active inclusion, therefore providing routes for all citizens.  I emphasise that because, frequently during the development of the strategy, people pigeonhole further education and training into one category or the other.  It either has social inclusion at its heart or it has enterprise at its heart, and never the twain shall meet.  In our view, the distinction is inaccurate.  If we are clear on the types of skills people need to get employment or increase their employability, if we are to recognise that everybody is starting from a different place on their journey and if we are true to our mission in this regard, we will link active inclusion with skills for the economy more accurately.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of apprenticeships and the fall-off therein, particularly in a number of trades.  It is true that there has been a fall-off.  Apprentice intake peaked in 2006 and 2007 and then fell off a cliff with the decline in the economy and the construction sector generally.  There were a considerable number of apprentices stuck in the system because they were not able to complete their programmes.  There was considerable investment in supporting those apprentices who were stuck to get over the line with some degree of success.  What we are observing is that, overall in respect of the existing set of 25 apprenticeships, recruitment this year has increased significantly over last year.  It is up approximately 47% year on year.  It is not where it needs to be.  The long-range needs of the economy require a greater intake of apprentices, including in the types of disciplines the Deputy raised.  We are working with the Construction Industry Federation of Ireland and others to try to bring forward responses to that.<\/p><p>  With regard to guidance, we agree completely that good guidance for people who are unemployed or wish to upskill or re-skill, through the Intreo system initially for the unemployed and then through the guidance service within education and training boards, has a value.  The strategy identifies the need to improve those services.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the amalgamation process involving SOLAS and the education and training boards.  It is ongoing.  In a formal sense, 40% of the old F&Aacute;S provision transferred to the education and training boards on 1 January this year.  The balance of 60% transferred on 1 July.  With regard to the logistical aspect, that has worked very well to date.  The education and training boards invested a lot of time with SOLAS to make sure the transition worked.  At the heart of our thinking in this regard is the view that we would not drop the ball with learners during the process.  We have met the education and training boards regularly, including this morning, to ensure we are co-operating fully to advance the amalgamation and the work on the strategy overall.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's point on investment, including in STEM and other courses, we are keeping all course provision under constant review.  One of the tools we will deploy to ensure that this works and that the State is getting a return on its investment is systematic evaluation, combined with an evidence-based approach to future decision making.  It is not just a case of what we think as we will bring a structure and rigour to the assessment of all further education and training programmes, of whatever hue and for whatever purpose.<\/p> <p>During 2014 the State has directly invested &euro;640 million through SOLAS and &euro;186 million through the Department of Education and Skills in post leaving certificate course provision.  This is a combined investment of approximately &euro;826 million, approximately one quarter of which goes towards income support for participants who need it.  It is a significant investment and we want to optimise its use so it is used efficiently.  A total of 91.5% of the SOLAS budget is a programme budget, principally in the form of direct grant aid to education and training boards and others.  There are also a number of national programmes.  The overhead part of this is approximately 3.7%, and we are also responsible for discharging the pensions of former staff members of F&Aacute;S and AnCO, which absorbs approximately 4.8%.  The State is making quite a significant investment and we want to ensure it is optimised and that we provide value for money.<\/p><p> The point made on the utilisation of workshops is quite correct.  In tandem with the fall-off in the construction sector in particular, many workshops which had been geared up towards the peak were under-utilised, but this is starting to turn.  During the period when we did not have the flow of new apprenticeships and new courses, we tried to provide workshop-based upskilling and reskilling.  We tried to manage the utilisation over this period.  I expect that as the economy turns we will start to have full utilisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200007#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked about the number of apprentices in particular disciplines.  The defining feature of the apprenticeship system is that the number of apprentices in the system is the number of boys and girls whom employers wish to employ.  Therefore, it is protected against oversupply.  The working committee on apprenticeship was faced with two difficult issues which we could not solve.  In an ideal world there should be a system whereby somebody employs a base stock of apprentices to prevent an under-correction.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have kittens if this were brought any further.  Conversely, at the height of the cycle there should be a way set a maximum, but it would have taken a brave person to tell a builder at the height of the boom that he or she could not take on any more carpenters or joiners because there would be a surplus.  One would probably have ended up in the High Court in a case taken on the right to earn a living.  These issues exist.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the school year.  I am on the board of Skillnets, which is the training networks initiative.  It deals mainly with private-sector trainers.  Very little training is done in July, August and December.  To the best of my knowledge there are no live proposals to change the school year.  The differences may be more apparent than real.  An issue that might arise is why every course must start in September.  Perhaps some courses could start in January.  At present, if somebody is made unemployed in January, he or she must wait until September.  This issue might need to be resolved.<\/p><p>  If I can be so bold as to make a suggestion to the committee, if it wants to go into detail and lift the bonnet on the sector, it should invite Seamus McGuinness and Dr. John Sweeney, both of whom have written reports, to come before it.  Seamus McGuinness was the lead researcher on the ESRI report which was mentioned, and Dr. John Sweeney produced a report for the National Economic and Social Council.  They would give the committee two sometimes different views, which is a good thing, on how the sector works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue mentioned a fear that this would be supply-driven and that courses or programmes would not be sufficiently demand-led.  There is huge potential and an opportunity for education and training boards to have a statutory sub-committee which represents local employers as well as the local providers, which are the education and training board and training and programme staff.  This would mean direct communication between employers, local industry and trainers.  In this way there would be direct engagement in each of the 16 catchment areas between the training centres or further education colleges and employers.  This would be very beneficial.  In 1997 plans were drawn up to do this through an adult education sub-committee.  It would be one way to address the issue, and would assure everybody that the courses would remain demand-led.<\/p><p>  The issue of guidance is important.  Education and Training Boards Ireland has repeatedly campaigned for proper guidance, particularly for the adult learning community.  These people are vulnerable and marginalised.  They may have lost a job, and perhaps their confidence, and are disoriented to a large extent.  They need direct support and guidance at a very vulnerable period in their lives.  This is why it is imperative to have a proper and effective guidance service, which we do not have at present as it has vastly reduced resources.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned resource issues, and perhaps he was speaking about training centres.  Post leaving certificate colleges are managed in the same way as second level schools, which is a crazy system.  They have never moved along from the structure and funding model of second level schools.  In 2008, just before the crash, we had agreed with trade unions and the Department to have a new structure which would be relevant to post leaving certificate course colleges.  These colleges are populated by adults and not by children.  We need to re-examine the establishment of a relevant support structure in these colleges which meets the needs of their clients.<\/p><p>  In the editorial I wrote for the most recent edition of ETBI news I raised the issue of working all year round.  We now have under the same bodies - the ETBs - training centres, which are effectively open and providing training and support 52 weeks of the year, and post leaving certificate course colleges, which are open for considerably less time than this as they are closed for July, August and part of September.  This needs to be addressed.  We have had informal discussions with the Teachers' Union of Ireland on this, and the former president, who is now a Senator, has raised the issue with me.  Teachers' unions are facing a dilemma in the sector.  If we are all there for the benefit of our clients and students we must examine year-round provision which meets the needs of the people we serve.  I seek engagement with teachers' unions, the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS to see if we can move from what is a school year to year-round provision in our colleges, as we have in our training centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415799900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked about meeting future demand for skills.

The pupil-teacher ratio increased to 19:1, which had an impact on the number of teachers available to teach in post leaving certificate colleges.  It reduced the capacity of a college to be as flexible as it might have been.  The effect was felt in the provision of courses with smaller numbers, as the colleges had to ensure the numbers were as high as possible.  The cap is a separate issue, and probably less of an issue this year than it was previously, as the numbers coming to post leaving certificate courses this year were lower throughout the country than they had been in previous years.  This is for a number of reasons.<\/p> <p>There are many changes in respect of Intreo as well as other external factors that changed the profile of the students coming to us at post leaving certificate level.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the impact on the pupil-teacher ratio.  It reduces the number of teachers available to the colleges.  Principally, this has the effect of reducing flexibility in terms of provision and the number of courses we can put on.  In general, the post leaving certificate courses reflect the skills needs in the areas they serve.  Generally speaking, the courses are aimed at providing skills that are needed in the economy.  Obviously, changes in recent years have affected us and certain courses have become almost redundant, especially those related to the construction sector, as was the case in respect of apprenticeships.  This has affected the colleges and resulted in a surplus of teachers in some areas.  That is the type of thing that has happened.  In general, the post leaving certificate colleges are thriving.  Reference was made to the fact that they are oversubscribed.  Most of them are still oversubscribed to a large extent.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue asked a question about amalgamation.  From the point of view of the education and training boards, the amalgamation has gone far more sweetly than we had anticipated.  We had many fears around it.  Most people facing any kind of major shift or merger would have big fears about such a change.  Thanks to our work with SOLAS in respect of the training centres coming across and through our work with the other vocational education committees prior to the amalgamation, many of the problems were anticipated.  That does not mean we are without problems.  This is a long, slow burner.  The first further education and training strategy runs until 2019 and we do not expect to have everything done in the next two or three years.

It was interesting to listen to their presentations.  I wish to comment briefly on the sector.  The strength of the sector lies in its history, which goes back deep into the 19th century, particularly in continental Europe.  Since then, the challenge of the continuum between the individual skills and work has been tackled by educational providers very successfully, whether by direct educational apprenticeships or through other preparatory courses.  This is at the heart of its success, and something that has succeeded for so long gives great confidence and competence to the providers today.  The tradition and history of something is important to its current success and credibility, and the sector has credibility.  One need only consider the colleges in Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Crumlin and Coolock.  Young people who never had a sniff of further education are flocking to these colleges.  They are overcrowded and students cannot get into them because the word on the ground is that if a person goes there he will get something out of it, not something vague but something practical and real.  Of course there will be certificates, garlands and presentations, but there is something real as well.  This is the secret of it.  It is a secret that has been well kept for a long time.  There has been an extraordinary level of courses.  Let us consider Ballyfermot College of Further Education, for example, which has rewritten an entire genre of film-making from scratch.  Other colleges have had equally successful experiences in different categories of the world of work.<\/p><p>  There is an equation involving the individual and work and how we bridge the gap and provide a safe crossing over the chasm.  This is what these initiatives have done.  It is extraordinary but it is not properly understood by people who write about it.  I happen to know a little about it because I was in it for a long time.  I hated leaving it and I might to go back to it.  Anyway, this has opened up a world for people from various social classes who, at 17, 18 or 19 years of age, had never been inside a college, and it has transformed their lives.  It is an extraordinary development.  Part of its success is that when something has history behind it, it gives a person two things: competence and confidence.  The talk of changing structures is peripheral.  The message is the same even if the way of delivering it has been modified a little.  It is simply technological change, but the basics never change.  There are human beings and there is the desire to work and be productive.  That much is eternal and never changes.  I commend the work that the deputation is doing because it is undervalued, but it is very valuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200009#K00300","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1415800500,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome the deputation.  There was a vote in the Seanad so I offer my apologies if the witnesses have already answered some of these questions.  My first question is for SOLAS and relates to labour market forecasting.  I am keen to hear the views on how it currently works.  I understand the SOLAS labour market research unit carries out forecasting.  Is SOLAS satisfied with the current abilities of the structure and how it is resourced?  Following the crash, many skilled people were left unemployed and without the necessary skills to bridge the gaps that existed.  I do not remember any statutory or semi-state body shouting out that this was going to happen.  Fundamentally, it is a question about predicting the labour market.  Are we in a better position now?  Are we setting out the structures whereby such an occurrence can be pre-empted or groups can forecast where the labour market is going?  That involves linking with business.  Where do we stand currently in that regard?  It is important that the same mistakes are not made again.<\/p><p>  The IBEC deputation referenced the OECD and the inevitability of vocational programmes in educational institutions becoming self-fulfilling as well as how they are not actually responding to business needs.  Where exactly do we stand on that?  Do we have sufficient business presence with regard to our labour market needs?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to re-skilling.  For example, following the crash, the skills of electricians were no longer required to the same extent.  I know people who changed course completely but got little support from the State with regard to a new career and re-skilling.  These issues need to be examined.  Germany has 350 recognised occupations covered by apprenticeship schemes, whereas here, according to my last recollection, the corresponding figure was 30 recognised trades which come under the relevant schemes.  What is the position with regard to this and occupations covered under the apprenticeship schemes?<\/p><p>  I will outline one example involving a young man who came to me.  He wanted to a course that happened to be in welding.  He was Galway-based but no training course was available there and he had to go to Ballina.  He was enthusiastic about it and went for his interview.  He got some equipment to do the welding course and practised with it.  He was eager and determined.  Then he did the interview, but did not get onto the course.  He got a one- or two-line response.  That was not encouraging for a young person.  I imagine it was a run-of-the-mill response, but we are supposed to be tackling youth unemployment.  I realise there is a balance to be struck with regard to long-term unemployment and youth employment.  There was a view that perhaps it went to someone on the live register who was long-term unemployed; I do not know.  I suppose that is equally commendable, but my point is we need to ensure that we are encouraging our young people throughout the process and that they get proper feedback.  This man went through a great deal of work to be successful in his interview and application.  It is important that we work with young people to encourage them and give them feedback rather than write out the standard letter.<\/p><p>  It is a little like mentoring but it is critical.  Someone mentioned self-esteem as I walked in the door, although I am unsure in what context.  Anyway, it is important that we tackle youth unemployment.  These people could potentially be our long-term unemployed.  I appreciate that we have a balance to strike between getting people who are long-term unemployed off the live register and tackling youth unemployment.<\/p> <p>I refer to the geographical spread of the courses.  He was prepared to travel to the next county to attend the training course.  I speak in general terms, but it is about striking a balance and getting to and tapping into enthusiastic young people when they have just left school or college.

I am sorry I had to leave, but there was a division in the Seanad.  <\/p><p>  It is no secret that I am a product of the further education sector and that I am always looking over my shoulder at the staff of the old VEC schools who gave us the sector we have today.  The system was not planned and grew organically.  We owe a significant amount to teachers and principals, in particular.  I have come across some imaginative principals in my time.<\/p><p>  I have a number of concerns about where we are going.  The first concerns the allocation of staff to further education colleges.  I am not sure if this issue was dealt with.  However, the allocation is based on the second level staffing system and it concerns me greatly that we are trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.  It simply will not work.  For example, every college should have a liaison officer to deal with local industry and who would be responsible for promoting courses and the college locally.  In the not too distant past a number of ETBs sought to second staff to be further education development officers.  I applaud this and funding should be made available for it because ETB managers are overwhelmed by the volume of work they must do, besides trying to take on an additional role.  If one considers the multiplicity of programmes offered by the large boards such as those in Cork, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoighaire, etc., there is so much work for the senior management team to do that it is not possible to allocate the time needed to conduct an overview of the development of further education and training within their areas.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about course development in further education colleges, in particular.  The college in Ballyfermot has developed outstanding programmes which were developed organically and for which there was no great plan.  They were a product of the innovation of the teachers.  I would not like SOLAS, with its overarching responsibility, to ring-fencie or take a national view of how courses should be developed and kill off innovation at the bottom of the pile where the teachers are.<\/p><p>  I am worried about the funding mechanisms that will be in place down the line, especially when the delegates refer to output-based funding.  I can understand from a quality assurance and a value for money point of view that people want to see a return for their money or outputs to reflect the input of cash.  However, there is an holistic aspect to education that we must address.  Not everybody will achieve or receive a certificate; therefore, they must be catered for.  I am not sure whether they should be catered for by modular provision or by allowing them to explore the programmes that might benefit them.<\/p><p>  Modular provision brings me back to services for industry.  Training centres market their programmes and meet the needs of industry in the workplace and I have long been saying further education colleges should do the same.  I recall a number of years ago planning to deliver a degree programme to De Beers in Shannon.  I would like to see that flexibility and freedom in the sector.  My former union members might have a difficulty with moving in that direction, but it is the one in which a modern economy needs to go to deliver programmes.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that every ETB does not have training centres located within its area   If I was an ETB chief executive officer, I would not want to borrow from a neighbouring board to provide training; I would want to have control in my area.<\/p><p>  I am extremely proud of the further education sector and the old IVEA and the ETBI for the work they did in developing the sector.  If it is to receive the recognition it deserves, SOLAS must come in 100% behind it, fund and staff it properly and give the teachers, lecturers and tutors the standing they rightly deserve in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200010#L00200","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1415801100,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Reference was made to assessing the need for courses.  In many cases, it is difficult to assess what is required when we do not know which companies will take on apprentices.  I was a victim of this.  In the past few years skills shortages have emerged.  When one is prepared to sponsor someone and offer him or her an apprenticeship, one is stopped because he or she does not have a piece of paper.  People aged between 45 and 55 years such as me went out into the world and learned from those who had gone before them.  We did not have a piece of paper in our hand.  I gave a document to the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Damien English.  Around Ireland there are people aged between 55 and 60 years who are willing to hand on the torch and it would not cost the Government money.  They have sons and daughters with different skills sets.  They are willing to do this, but because of the need to have a little piece of paper, they are forbidden from doing so.<\/p><p>  AnCO was one of the greatest organisations ever.  Anybody who came out of it was trained to a standard.  I have worked on many construction sites and during the boom, if one acted and looked like a driver, one was a driver, but I guarantee that this cannot continue.  The standard being set for apprenticeships is not good enough.  A little piece of paper that tells someone he or she can go down a fall and dig a trench 20 yards long does not make him or her a digger driver.  As Senator Hildegarde Naughton said, a long time ago people went to Mervue or the boatyards in Galway to take welding courses and so on and they learned a trade.  The six week course now provided does not make a heavy welder; the hours and resources have to be put in.  I question the pieces of paper going around.  We have to change the mindset behind the way we do everything.<\/p><p>  We talk about looking forward.  A year ago we were looking forward to the roll-out of broadband services, with wires to be laid and so on.  However, we are importing 260 people every six months to do this, while, at the same time, only 16 people are being trained in a college to do this work.  I hope common sense will prevail because I am passionate about apprenticeships.  I have identified the urgent need for between 5,000 and 6,000 apprentices.  I have identified where 90% of the crane drivers aged between 65 and 70 years are and the different skills sets people in this age cohort possess.  I believe in technology and moving forward, but if apprenticeships are not served on the ground, one will not have the building in which to put the computer or the road leading to the building.  A root and branch analysis of the system is needed and courses have to be lengthened.  There is a shimozzle over trainers and safety courses.<\/p> <p>This comes from employers.  It costs a person &euro;300 to take a safety training course and the next course also costs &euro;300.  We need a multitasker to deliver courses at a price people can afford to drive forward all of the different skills sets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200010#L00300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415801700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked the question I was going to pose and more ably than I would have.

In the context of a five year strategy to develop educational skills, the flexibility of the back to education allowance is important.  Those who have reached a certain level on the qualifications framework but want to retrain at a lower level are unable to do so because they are blocked from accessing allowances and assistance.  There are many who have trained in something which has not worked out for them or which is no longer a marketable qualification and they are blocked off and unable to participate in something which would get them back into the workforce.

We do not know the impact of the BTEA rules or the 2020 allowance.  Although we are not certain what factors cause a drop or reduction, individual learners tell us situations are caused by the existing rules.  Given that we need rules, how do we get around the problem?  How do we make exceptions?  Senator Hildegarde Naughton mentioned exceptions being made in particular circumstances, which is a difficulty, not so much for us but for the Department of Social Protection or Education and Skills.  All the rules are in place for a particular reason, to encourage people to continue on the cycle of returning to education and upskilling, and they have an impact on those who are unable to work using a particular skill and want to retrain.  The issue often arises in our discussions because people return to us who want to be reskilled but for whom these barriers are in place.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputies Gerard P.

They take great pride in the standard they have reached.  <\/p><p>  Members have also mentioned the length of time training takes.  It takes time to develop serious skills.  Members probably referred to upskilling in an area such as heavy welding or other short courses developed to build on existing skills.  There is a view about whether they were sufficient.

All existing apprenticeships are under formal review at the moment.  They are being worked through a process with SOLAS and partners and will be considered by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, later this month.  There is a process whereby people with skills and experience in a particular craft can seek to acquire the qualification through a process called \"recognition of prior learning\".  They would be assessed under this process.  It is not for everybody so I do not want to overstate it, but we can provide details of that to the Deputy if he is interested in following up on the point.<\/p><p> Deputy Bannon asked whether people lost out simply because of a threshold.  I cannot speak to the JobBridge programme as that is under the remit of the Department of  Social Protection, but if people are supported and have the information there is a huge range of opportunities, some at very low cost, so that people need not be left behind just because of that threshold.

Just to reassure some of the people who are here, particularly from a further education background, it is not just about labour market activation.

We are projecting employment to reach 2.02 million by the year 2020.  Our current forecasters are predicting that construction employment will reach approximately 150,000 in 2017.  That is in the context where probably the largest category of occupation on the live register is craft-related areas, at roughly 70,000 people.<br\/>The labour market research unit has a number of outputs.  We host the national skills database, which is a very useful tool, and from that we assist the expert group on future skill needs in a number of publications on an annual basis, most notably the <i>National Skills Bulletin <\/i>and the training and education outputs.  We monitor bricks-and-mortar and online recruitment agencies for vacancies and monitor those trends over time.  We also publish for apprenticeship forecasting, and expect to become heavily involved in forecasting for the new apprenticeship council that is to be established shortly.  <br\/>We conduct follow-up-surveys every two years, and this is an important aspect of what we have been doing, on the training provision since the mid-1990s.  Recently we have been doing them every year so we are able to monitor and track the effectiveness of the provision.  This year, there have been a couple of developments to expand that into the further education sector.  SOLAS is currently working with statisticians from the Department of Education and Skills and the Central Statistics Office with a view to identifying the economic status of former learners who participated in PLC programmes in 2013, for example.  The data will be used to complement the results of the follow-up survey which SOLAS has conducted of former F&Aacute;S trainees who also attended courses in 2012.  We also intend to conduct another follow-up survey in early 2015 of former learners who attended F&Aacute;S courses in 2013.  We are currently engaged in negotiations with the CSO with a view to gaining access to four major administrative datasets which will enable the skills and labour market research unit to continuously monitor the economic status of former learners on FET outcomes.  <br\/>On the one hand, we have identification of skills and, on the other, over the next few years we will be able to carry out tracking.  That is all very well, but what do we do now?  Each year we publish regional labour market profiles which are presented to each of the educational training boards and that breaks down the labour and employment demographics and the supply of education and training by region.

This is done under five broad areas where further education providers could consider enhancing provision: selling and marketing, supply chain management, green economy and ICT.

The on-the-job aspect is critical, particularly for young people.<br\/>Commentators have made reference to the German apprenticeship system, but it is worth mentioning that the German system serves two main purposes - direct transition from school into the labour market for young and old alike and securing the skills that companies need.  However, what we tend not to hear is that, under the German model, one must go through a particular training programme and become licensed to take up one of the 350 occupations.  This debate may need to be held in Ireland in respect of new apprenticeships and occupations.  Of the 2.1 million businesses in Germany, approximately 450,000 are involved in apprenticeships.  Three quarters of businesses are not involved <i>per se<\/i>.  The 1.3 million apprentices are governed by a national compact under which employers make places available across the occupations.  There is a central clearing house.  We may need to examine whether the Irish economy can support this number of new occupations, as we do not know.  We have been in discussions with employers and the range of apprenticeships will expand, as it must.

I will ask my colleague Dr. Bryan Fields to comment later.  First, I wish to say that every programme, no matter what its source or nature, must have an objective and targeted outcome.  The key point is that it would be a labour market outcome in some or several cases.  Many people are not at that stage yet, so we have to devise the indicators of success around the nature of the programme.  That is done in an open way and it is our intention to do so.  Dr. Fields might discuss the matter further.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned a couple of related points such as the transparency of funding.  This year, with a gargantuan effort and co-operation by the education and training boards, we published the first further education and training services plan.

That is a starting point, and we will develop the initiative.<\/p><p>  Let me turn to third level education.  There were two aspects to the points made about third level education.  Perhaps my comments will also answer Senator Jim D'Arcy's point.  Over the past number of years, almost 20% of people who undertook training courses had a third level qualification but had found themselves unemployed.  They sought a supplementary skill or change of direction and the system was very open to that idea.<\/p><p>  The points made by the Chairman probably open up a broader discussion.  We have tended to pigeonhole qualifications around the third level or further education and training sector.  Perhaps that is the issue we need to address.  Some of the Senators and Deputies made the point about what is valued.  As I said in my opening statement, the SOLAS mandate covers the National Framework of Qualifications levels 1 to 6, which is intermediate, technical and entry levels.  That is our space and that is what we work with, but it does not preclude a more sensible allocation in terms of how courses are delivered.

Over the past number of years I have been concerned about the notion, reinforced by the publication of school league tables in the national press, that success is determined only by access to third level education, which is completely and utterly wrong.  As Senator Craughwell has rightly said, people enter into further education and graduate from further education colleges with significant qualifications and skills.  Unfortunately, the league tables do not give them credit and their omission is dumping on the further education sector.  As I have done before, I appeal to the press to bear that in mind and end their dreadful disservice to our sector.<\/p><p>  Senator Craughwell and others have mentioned skills.  The European Commission and all the recent reports talk about the importance of generic skills, which are critical thinking, the ability to work in a team and the ability to speak in public.  An important part of community education is the development of confidence and the development of a rounded person.  We have the specific skills as well.  There must be a balance in the education and training system between what industry demands in terms of specific skills and the provision of the important social dimension of educating people in generic and developmental skills.

ETBs are now up and running but it took a long time to establish the boards.  The final one was established only ten days ago, and the names will be available on our website.  As I reckon this will be my last opportunity to talk today, I congratulate Senator Craughwell on his elevation to the Seanad.  He comes from this sector.   <\/p><p>  Finally, we have hosted visits by three international groups in recent months.  They came here to look at the massive reform that has taken place and were impressed, even though it is in its infancy and its full impact has not become evident yet.  They are very engaged in what we have done here, particularly those from the new accession countries to the European Union from Eastern Europe.  Recently we brought them to the Blackrock Further Education Institute, which is under the remit of the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB.  Senator Craughwell will be very familiar with the establishment.  It is an outstanding establishment and a credit to the sector.  I was delighted to bring our international visitors to such a fine establishment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200014#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Moriarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1415803500,"counter":59,"content":"<p>As Senator Jim D'Arcy has returned, I can tell him that his question on ETBs has been answered and the last ETB was set up ten days ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014111200014#P00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415803500,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I said that there had been a long election process for the ETBs, but that is now complete and we will make the names available.

As the Chairman said, I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Glen Lucken, the group's chief financial officer; Mr. Shane O'Sullivan, managing director of the group's asset management unit; and Mr. Ger Mitchell, the group's head of lending.  We have responded to the questionnaire the committee submitted to us last week and look forward to taking questions.  However, I thought it might be helpful to make a few general comments before the questions began.<br\/>This is proving to be a very significant year for the Permanent TSB group.  As we have stated to the committee previously, our primary objective is to restore Permanent TSB as a viable, competitive bank focused on the Irish retail banking sector.  In doing so, we wish to bring competition and innovation to customers across the country and maximise our ability to return as much as possible of the investment the taxpayer made in the group through the Minister for Finance.  This year we have made very significant progress on a number of key fronts.  <br\/>Financially, we have made huge progress in reducing our losses and moving much closer to a position where the group as a whole will be profitable again.  The numbers reflect the enormous strides we have made in delivering the group's key strategic goals of creating a smaller and safer bank, rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet, providing innovative competition in the retail banking marketplace and providing sustainable and affordable arrears treatments.  In summary, our goal is to do banking better and operate to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. <br\/>In terms of the focus of the bank, we have targeted the key retail segments that underpin our core competence - current accounts, deposits, mortgages and consumer finance.  We have sold those businesses that do not fit with that business model and will continue to do so at prices that optimise the use of taxpayers&rsquo; capital.  We believe that after the sovereigns crisis, customers will continue to be attracted by a back to basics business model that does not carry the risks of geographical diversification or complexity.  That will be the source of our success in the medium term. <br\/>In financial terms, we are targeting a return on equity of above 10% for the core bank by 2018.  Of course, a smaller, safer bank starts with its balance sheet, where we have reduced significantly the group's dependency on ECB funding and grown the deposit base.  In the coming months we will restructure and strengthen the capital base. <br\/>On the competition front, we have been very successful in attracting new customers, be they mortgage customers, current account customers or deposit customers.  We have grown our market positions in key sectors and are providing real banking competition.  In the case of mortgages, for example, we are looking at a market share of over 13% where two years ago it was under 2%.  Perhaps most importantly, on the key challenge of dealing with customers in mortgage difficulties, we are making significant progress.  At the end of August the number of customers in arrears for more than 90 days was down by over 21% since the start of the year.  We are in constructive engagement and have made long-term, realistic and sustainable agreements with thousands of customers which will help to ensure they remain in their homes. <br\/>The progress we are making in recovering a business which, after the financial crash, was effectively on life-support is testament to the strength of character of the group's staff, the encouragement of the broader system, the improving Irish macro-economic environment and, most importantly, the financial support of the people.  We do not take this support lightly; we endeavour each and every day to serve with a focus that does not hide from our troubled past but is focused on rebuilding an asset of value for the people.  Of course, in this context, it would not be appropriate if I did not comment on the recent single supervisory mechanism, SSM, comprehensive assessment.  The exercise was conducted through three lenses.  The first is the asset quality review, AQR, and this part of the exercise was designed to review the provisions made by the participating banks by testing the models which underpinned these provisions.  Of course, weak provisioning was a key factor in the banking crisis; therefore, it is critical that everyone can be confident that the provisioning models are robust and objective.  In the case of Permanent TSB, that exercise effectively validated our provisioning policy.  The group did not require any capital as a result of the AQR review.<br\/>The second part of the exercise reviewed how the group&rsquo;s capital levels would be affected in what was called a baseline stress test scenario, that is, how the capital levels would be affected by events which might reasonably be expected to occur in the coming three years.  In our case, it was found that our capital levels would hold up well and would be in excess of the levels required at all stages through the planning period.  Again, this was very encouraging. <br\/>The final element of the exercise, the adverse stress test scenario, examined how the group&rsquo;s capital levels would perform in what the ECB itself referred to as an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; scenario.  The ECB called this the adverse stress scenario and described it as &ldquo;unlikely to occur&rdquo;.  In this scenario, it was found that the balance sheet of the group as at 31 December last<b><i><\/i><\/b>would see a shortfall of required capital of some &euro;855 million if these events did, in fact, unfold.  However, as I said, this adverse scenario was applied to the balance sheet as it stood almost one year ago.  Much has changed since and we were able to state on the day of the results that we had already accounted for over 80% of the identified shortfall.  The full level of the amount for which we have accounted, which is over the 80% figure, will be confirmed through the capital plan exercise in which we are engaged. <br\/>We have also stated we will now engage with the international capital markets.  In this regard, we have met in the past week or so the investment communities in London, New York and Boston and I can confirm that there is real interest in the PTSB story and its profitable growth potential.  Of course, while good progress has been made, we certainly acknowledge that much remains to be done.  We are particularly conscious that the taxpayer has invested a net &euro;2.7 billion in the group.  That investment brings significant responsibilities to me and my colleagues, both to protect and, I hope, return as much of that investment as possible and, importantly, to ensure we act fairly and equitably in dealing with customers.  Everyone in the bank is fully aware of these responsibilities, which is reflected in how we deal with customers in mortgage difficulties, how we try to create innovative products for our customers in areas like mortgages, current accounts and deposits, and how we try to ensure we will, over time, be as competitive as possible in our lending rates.<\/p> <p>Inevitably, we cannot please all of the people all of the time.  However, we are working hard to strike the right balance and advance towards the goal of restoring the bank as a profitable, competitive, customer-focused business with which customers are happy to do business and staff are proud to be associated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415801700,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Masding for sticking to the time limit.

That is the nature of what they do.  I do not expect Mr. Masding to respond, but I express my concern about seeing the State's shareholding in Permanent TSB diluted significantly as a result of the investment the bank is seeking.  I would not like this.  The State has invested &euro;2.2 billion in net terms and the final shape of the capital plan for the bank must protect the integrity of the State's investment in Permanent TSB.  That is a matter between Mr. Masding and the shareholder, but I express my opinion on it.<\/p><p>  I move to the issue of interest rates and, in particular, the standard variable interest rates the bank is charging.  Notwithstanding the reduction of a couple of years ago, the bank is still at the high end for an LTV of between 80% and 90% for new mortgages and a gross rate of 4.59%.  The bank has 79,000 standard variable rate customers in different LTV brackets.  What is Mr. Masding's reaction to the decision of AIB to reduce its rate?  AIB's comparable rate for an LTV of over 80% is, 4.25% which is significantly lower than Permanent TSB's rate.  Is the bank reviewing its rates in the light of this?

As I would not wish to insult the Deputy with a bland answer, I will build on that comment.  I note some facts for the Deputy.  Our blended cost of funds is 178 basis points.  If one looks at Bank of Ireland's which I noted from the transcript of last week's meeting, it is 115 basis points.  By definition, we need to work towards a lower cost of funds, but that will take us time.  The Deputy will understand we still have to work through legacy issues.  At one stage, we had a loan to deposit ratio of 241%.  The Deputy will understand it will take us time to bring the cost of funds down.  The cost of funds is the first thing to which I point.  Of course, the cost of funds does not include the cost of running the bank, the cost of risk or the cost of capital, all of which we must cover to make the bank viable and profitable.  <\/p><p>  The last thing I would say about a blended rate across the group is that our NIM is 88 basis points.  Therefore, we still have a significant mountain to climb.  I am absolutely conscious that we must be competitive which I hope has been a hallmark of the team.  As the Deputy rightly said, it was reflected in our early decision to reduce our variable rates unilaterally when I first started and we were a significant outlier.  We will continue to monitor rates closely and do what we can to reduce our cost of funds, increase our net interest margin and run an efficient business.  If am able to do this, we will ultimately be able to reduce our variable rates, where possible.

It is stated that there are more than 6,200 principal private residences where loss of the home is a very real prospect, with an assisted voluntary sale, voluntary surrender or legal action under way.  Plus, there are 1,800 buy-to-let properties in the same category.  That means there are more than 8,000 homes, three quarters of which are family homes, now in a very serious situation whereby either there is agreement for the home to be surrendered or it is essentially before the court.  That is a very significant jump in numbers from where the bank expected to be a number of months ago when Permanent TSB was last before this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200006#F00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415802300,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Let me offer some perspective, and then I will hand over to Mr. O'Sullivan so that he can add some operational expertise.<\/p><p>  As I have explained to the committee in the past, we have had to build our arrears management function from scratch because the competence in the organisation was at best sub-optimum.

I received a letter which contained important comments.  Mr. Masding has continually said that he is proud of the bank's mortgage arrears procedures, and he has made similar comments today.<br\/>We have discussed letters when Mr. Masding has appeared before this committee.  I have received a letter from a couple who are not young.  Both of them lost their jobs and went into re-education.  One is working and the other hopes to qualify soon.  They are in mortgage arrears and have left their house which has been on the market since 2009.  Mr. Masding's bank wrote to them in November 2013 offering them an assisted sale despite the fact that the house was on the market since 2009.  Mr. Masding's bank has continually engaged with them at the wrong address, despite being notified by them and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service that they had moved to a different part of the country.  The bank wrote to them acknowledging that they told the bank a year ago, in August 2013, that they had changed address.  Despite this, the bank only put that in its system in September 2014.<br\/>These people wrote to me because they are quite frustrated by what happens at these committees, including the suggestion that mortgage arrears are being dealt with appropriately.  The letter stated:<blockquote>The bank has not been engaging with their customers.  Our situation was let go until our home went into negative equity.  They were alerted of our impending demise at every step of the way.  At no point did anyone engage with us or suggest anything other than to send in standard financial statements to our local branch, while never offering a solution - obviously, ticking boxes for them, showing that they are dealing with the situation when they clearly are not.  I am attaching the most recent letter from them, along with my response. [The person goes on to say] We are standing at the abyss.  It takes everything we have to try to move forward with our lives every day.  I am beginning to feel like it is slipping away from me.,  I fight back for so long and then lose the energy or will, and it takes all I have to respond to their incessant, meaningless letters.  This is quite difficult for me to write.<\/blockquote>I suggest to Mr. Masding that he needs to be more careful in terms of his language and how the bank is dealing with these individuals.  These two people are not alone.  I know that a lot of progress has been made by Mr. Masding's bank and he has acknowledged that he did not have the right procedures, but there is a long way to go yet.

We were over-exposed to the ECB in the past.  I refer to the loan-to-deposit ratio and filling the funding gap with the ECB when the capital markets closed.  I think we would be extremely nervous over the next few years if Permanent TSB gorged itself again on ECB funding.

Such cases are difficult for us and our customers.  We only arrive in the legal process after we have exhausted every other avenue.

As to our view on it, we advocate a more moderate approach towards the proposals and even to consider a more graduated approach.  The situation is dynamic.

As somebody who has studied housing historically, it strikes me, and Mr. Mitchell alludes to it, that the focus on customer affordability and repayment capacity is a more important matter than loan-to-value ratios for the sake of argument.  This three times income is harking back to the 1970s, 1980s and earlier when we were dealing with a completely different mortgage market and a different interest rate regime than at present.  The Governor has indicated that part of the reason he is doing this is to avoid another bubble in the housing market.  Does Mr. Masding believe we are either in or approaching a property bubble?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200013#N01600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415807100,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I will start and then Mr. Mitchell will chip in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1415807100,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I do not know how much time I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1415807100,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1415807100,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I have approximately four questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415807100,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will answer really slowly, so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1415807100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1415807100,"counter":343,"content":"<p>An honest witness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111200014#O00700","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415807100,"counter":344,"content":"<p>That is my invite to the Ministry of fisheries Christmas party.

Other banks are probably doing this, but none of them is stating it publicly as a policy.  What is the thinking behind it?

I go back to the point we made earlier, namely, we see a significant distinction between debt forgiveness and debt write-off.  Debt forgiveness is the unilateral forgiveness of debt upfront.  We do not think there is necessarily a balance of fairness in the proposition.  Earlier a Senator spoke about two people living next door to each other, both of whom have the same jobs and income, and asked whether it is right that one party has debt forgiven while the other works tirelessly to repay the debt.  We do not believe there is equality in this example.  This is debt forgiveness, and we avoid it at all costs.  However, debt write-off is a different proposition.  Where people work with us as hard as they can in difficult circumstances we believe a different balance of fairness can be struck.  If our borrowers are willing to sell their underlying property to repay the maximum amount of debt they and we can get from the sale of the property, we believe it is right to go a step further with them.  We feel the balance we have struck, which is up to 80%, is right.  With regard to other propositions, earlier we spoke about personal insolvency.

We touched on a number of items in our submission.  We gave a high level overview of our issues with the value for money review.  We indicated the value that the Reserve Defence Force brings to the State, the civilian skills that the Reserve Defence Force has at its disposal and we indicated we would seek an independent review of the Reserve Defence Force.  We also expressed a view that there was a very real risk that, because of the value for money review and reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force, the force would cease to exist by 2016.<\/p><p>  The value for money review recommended that a further formal review of the Reserve Defence Force be conducted after a period of four years with a view to examining the utility and capacity levels and the progress of the reserve.  We are now at the half way mark and we think it opportune to provide our views on what has transpired.  We will do this under four main pillars: first, the introduction of key performance indicators; second, the structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force; third, recruitment; and fourth, the package of support required for the Reserve Defence Force. <\/p><p>These areas can be explored in depth with my colleagues during the question and answer session.  I ask for the indulgence of members as I can give them the view of the Army Reserve but not of the Naval Service reserve.  I will invite my colleague Mr Colgan to make some points in that regard when I finish.<\/p><p>  While we have always objected to the premise for the latest reorganisation, we do have to commend the Defence Force on how it has approached its task.<\/p> <p>As always, it has demonstrated that leadership in change management, so much so that the administrative order that was to change the Reserve Defence Force was issued the same month as the value for money review was published.  That was a very quick timeframe.  It was not formalised until 2013, but this is the document that governed the restructuring in the Reserve Defence Force and what was to happen thereafter.  A core tenet of this administrative order is what is known as &ldquo;the single Force concept&rdquo;.  This entailed the disestablishment of Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve units and the insertion of Reserve elements into permanent units. The theory behind that is that a single chain of command would allow greater scope for collective training and operational effectivenes.<br\/>The administrative instruction also sets out how the new Reserve Defence Force is to operate and identifies a number of key performance indicators against which Reserve Defence personnel will be evaluated.  These are used to assess the individual effectiveness of members of the Reserve Defence Force.  They consist of a number of criteria, which include paid and unpaid training, a medical test, a fitness test and an annual personal weapons test.  The concept of objective measurement criteria is welcomed within the Reserve.  It is not something to which we are adverse.  It should serve as a true measure of the output of the organisation and it also serves as a motivational aspect that can individual reservists seek to achieve and obtain.  However, any such criteria must be realistic and achievable, and adequate resources must be given to personnel in order to achieve them.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case and there is a number issues with the key performance criteria that have been imposed on the Reserve Defence Force. These issues relate both to the criteria themselves and to the method in which they have been implemented.<br\/>I will not go into the merits of the key performance indicators, but I would like to explore some of the issues that we have encountered when we have tried to achieve them.  At the outset, the Reserve Defence Force has been imposed upon permanent units, so immediately there is a mismatch between the working hours of each element. Whilst the terms of service of the Permanent Defence Force are 24-7, in reality the usual working hours outside of operational duties or training are Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.  For the Reserve, on the other hand, the majority of the training is conducted in the evenings or at weekends in order to accommodate our civilian employment and our other obligations.  This presents an immediate problem when it comes to the administration of the key performance indicators.  For example, if I have to undergo a medical test it will be conducted by the Medical Corps, which operates during normal working hours.<br\/>The test consists of two parts, with each part conducted on two different days.  My fitness test consists of three parts, with the first two parts conducted on one day and the third part on another.  Another two days are now gone.  Additionally, if the permanent unit conducts its annual range practice, where I am tested on my weapon, on a weekday, I have now potentially used up five days of annual leave to satisfy administrative requirements.  That is essentially a reservist using up 25% of his or her statutory annual leave entitlement on administrative matters.  That is without taking into account the fact that we may be called up for full-time training.  If I do one period of full-time training, I have now used up 50% of my annual leave, and if I try to do a career course, which is generally structured over two weeks, I will have used up 75% of my statutory leave entitlement.  It is a ridiculous situation; reservists cannot be expected to meet this.  We cannot be expected to use up our annual leave on administrative tasks.  It is an unreasonable expectation, particularly where there is no legislation to protect reservists in their civilian employment.  In addition, we are being asked to meet these criteria without the same support that our permanent colleagues have.  We are not entitled to the same medical care or benefits and we do not have the access to facilities that they have.  It is specifically set out in the administrative instruction that reservists will not be afforded the facilities or time to train for these key performance indicators during full-time training.  All responsibility lies with the reservists, in their own time, and that is something that cannot be said for their permanent colleagues.<br\/>When the next review is conducted, the cold figures will indicate that a certain percentage of reservists have not met their key performance indicators.  No investigation will be conducted into what actually occurred, or into the organisational and administrative obstacles that were put in reservists' way.  Nor will anything be said in regard to the personal time and sacrifice that was required to meet these criteria.  Instead, the criteria will be used to denigrate reservists and will completely ignore the fact that the process has been implemented in a way that was completely unworkable. <br\/>What is particularly striking is that are no similar key performance indicators for our permanent colleagues. The Reserve Defence Force is a training output of the Permanent Defence Force.  Our standards should reflect on the input of the Permanent Defence Force.  When assessing the output of any service, surely it would make sense to assess the service provider.  Yet again the regime is set up to scrutinise the reservists and we must stand up and be counted.  There is no similar situation for our permanent colleagues, who will say they have training standards to meet each year which include accounting for the Reserve.  This is a circular argument because they will use the key performance indicators of the Reserve to see whether or not they have made their training output.  Our fear is that, as happened in the last Value for Money report, questions will not be asked as to what our permanent colleagues did or did not do in respect of the Reserve.  Instead, there will be a focus on the Reserve failing to meet its objectives.  When we fail, as is already pre-determined, the true problems will conveniently be ignored. Reservists face eventual discharge for failing to meet their key performance indicators but the same cannot be said of our permanent colleagues if they fail in their obligations to the Reserve. <br\/><b><\/b>I would like to speak about the structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  Aside from the issues with key performance indicators, we have to contend with the difficulties of dealing with a full-time professional Force as part-time professionals. There is no doubt in our minds that there is commitment to the Reserve Defence Force at the very highest levels in the Defence Forces.  The General Staff has indicated that it is committed to making this work.  The addition of Reserve elements to permanent units represents an additional workload on top of the existing workload, with no incentive or reward in return. We noted when we were last before this committee that the loss of the cadre staff was significant in terms of the loss of experience and knowledge.  It appeared to us that the reorganisation was being pushed through in a very tight timeframe without adequate consideration of the inherent differences between both organisations.  Many of our concerns have proven justified. <br\/>The reorganisation was supposed to be implemented by 30 March 2013, yet in 2014 we were still dealing with issues arising from it.  As the reorganisation progressed, it was very evident that there were significant issues in the records and administration of the Reserve Defence Forces and this impeded the smooth transition of the Reserve into the permanent Defence Forces.  On top of this, many of the cadre staff retired and, with them, their knowledge and experience was lost.  Permanent units were left to grapple with an administration system with which they were not familiar and on which they were not trained.  As a result, reservists have suffered delays in pay, restrictions on training and denial of entitlements.  Greater demands are being placed on reservists in respect of training during normal working hours so that they can train with their permanent colleagues.  By no means is this a criticism of the permanent Defence Force.  It would be unrealistic to expect someone to work all week and then come in again in the evenings or at weekends for no extra incentive or reward. The irony is that this is exactly what reservists are expected to do.  We have gone to a situation where our rewards and incentives have been taken away and the incentive is more &ldquo;stick&rdquo; than &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; at this point.<br\/>Compounding this is the problem that the complete military legislative and administrative structure to govern the reorganised Reserve has not been put in place.  It is astounding that 20 months into the reorganisation, we are still working under old administrative systems which do not take account of the reorganisation or the increased standards and commitment required of the Reserve.  There is an inconsistency between the old regulations and the newly introduced key performance indicators and this has led to confusion as to what governs reservists and what happens if reservists do not meet their key performance indicators.<\/p> <p> As a result of the knowledge deficit the permanent units have been forced to do the best they can under the circumstances.  Unfortunately, this has resulted in a lack of uniformity of decisions, with unit commanders taking varying approaches to clothing, equipment, training, recording of training hours, development of courses and limits on paid training.  Depending on their unit, some reservists have been able to engage in training that was beyond their wildest dreams and others have suffered through what we would term \"malicious obedience\" on the part of middle management, whereby the focus is on attaining key performance indicators, with no advancement of reservists' military skills or training.<\/p><p> On the issue of recruitment, the administrative instruction for the organisation identifies that a priority for it will be whether it can maintain the level of quality recruitment necessary to staff the Reserve Defence Force for the next 3&ndash;5 years.  The establishment of the Reserve Defence Force went from 9,500 to 4,069.  By January 2014 we were already 1,200 under strength.  The current strength is 1,734.  In order to meet our establishment by 2016, we must recruit 2,335 reservists.  This represents a figure of over 1,000 recruits a year, which would prove a difficult task for full-time personnel and absolutely out of reach for part-time professionals.  Simply put, the resources are not there to train that number of people in this time period.  The Reserve Defence Force will not be able to meet this and the shortcomings in its previous administration by its permanent staff meant that the numbers on the books never reflected the numbers in reality.<\/p><p> On a positive note, a recruitment campaign ran from March to April 2014.  This was a very professional campaign and was run through a combination of national and regional press media, social media and national careers portal.  It was the first time that a campaign for the Reserve Defence Forces was run in a centralised manner.  The media campaign was very positive and progressive and it represented an innovative approach to the use of many and varied forms of social media and serves only to underscore the professionalism expected in the Reserve Defence Force today.  The \"single force\" concept was reinforced by the fact that there was no difference between the campaign for reservists and the Permanent Defence Force and there was no sense of disparity in the value that either arm of the Defence Forces provides to the State.  Objective bystanders would have obtained an impression of a young, professional combined force with plenty of opportunities for the young, willing and able.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, there were some disadvantages to the approach.  Advertising for both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force on the same platform caused confusion.  This was compounded by the fact that applicants were directed to the Defence Forces&rsquo; website where the application process was conducted under the \"careers\" section.  The Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve have their own dedicated sections of this website and it would have been logical for applications for either element to go through that.  However, it went through the careers section, which caused confusion for people who are less knowledgeable about the Defence Forces.  In addition, service in the Reserve is not technically a career.  This added to the confusion.  From our research, we know that certain applicants erroneously applied for the Reserve when they had intended to apply for the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p><p> Successful applicants then progressed to the assessment stage of the campaign.  The assessments consisted of a fitness test, interview and medical exam.  Again, this is a positive development for the Reserve Defence Force as it demonstrates a professional approach to the recruitment and selection of appropriate candidates for the Reserve.  This assessment process is usually the first time these candidates meet face-to-face and the process reinforces the fact that candidates are joining a modern and well-equipped Defence Force.  However, issues arose at this stage whereby candidates for the Reserve Defence Force were treated in a similar manner to candidates for the Permanent Defence Force.  Some were given short notice of medical tests and interviews.  Interviews were conducted during the working week which meant that those in employment had to take leave from work to attend.  <\/p><p> To its credit, the Permanent Defence Force has learned from the early campaign and is implementing a new recruitment campaign that has taken on some of our recommendations.  Unfortunately it does not take away from the fact that of two recruitment campaigns in 2014, one was flawed and the other will not provide output until 2015.  We are therefore in a situation where we cannot reach our established strength by 2016 and we believe that this will again be pointed to as a failure on the part of the Reserve.<\/p><p> We would like to make it clear that we embrace the single Force concept and its ideals.  However, this concept cannot be implemented successfully by the Defence Forces alone.  It requires a robust and holistic approach based on four pillars.  In order to have a viable and effective Reserve Defence Force, we need a complete package which includes a shift in Government defence policy, legislative underpinning and engagement with employers. <\/p><p> This approach will require bravery.  It requires the same type of courage demonstrated by the current Chief of Staff in the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  This courage is now also required on the part of politicians, such as this committee.  As it stands, the Reserve Defence Force is being set up to fail - the outcome of the next review is virtually preordained.  The authors of the value for money review have been quite clever.  They did not get their way the first time, so they have set up a structure whereby, at the next review, they will sit back and say &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;.  That is sad on so many levels.<\/p><p> With the Chair's indulgence, I would like to ask Mr. Eoin Colgan to make some remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415803200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>We are way over five minutes, but I would like to give the witnesses as much flexibility as possible if my colleagues do not mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200004#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415803200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I addressed this committee in 2013 and I thank it for granting me that privilege on that occasion.  On that occasion we were dealing with the fall-out from the value for money report and we made a conscious decision to take a positive and proactive approach to this report.  We were happy that it had come and we were going to get on with it.  We were then, and still are, very much committed to making it work.  For the public record, I would like to make the point that from the perspective of the Naval Service Reserve, the value for money report was an odious document, which was reverse-engineered to arrive at a predetermined conclusion that the Reserve Defence Force, both the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve, were a bad lot and had to be got rid of.  Naval Service Reserve personnel found it particularly galling that the efforts and successes of the force had been quite washed out.  No naval officer was on that value for money board and therefore we feel the Department took the chance to airbrush the Naval Service Reserve success out of that report.  One might ask why it would do that.  The answer is simple: the Naval Service Reserve showed the inconvenient truth that the professional military organisation, the Navy, could use its reserve in an effective manner for the benefit of both the navy and the general public.  If one had the time to go back and read that report, one would find that there are far more references to and discussion of the Garda Reserve than the Naval Service Reserve.  The net result of this report from our perspective is that we were slashed from an establishment of 400 to 200, despite the fact that we live on an island in the Atlantic, with a coastline of some 7800 km.  Some 200 personnel between our four units left us with 50 personnel for each unit and a long list of key performance indicators to be achieved.  We feel we have been set up to fail.<\/p><p>  In practice the Naval Service Reserve's experience of the single Force concept has been that it is a lot of paperwork and very little in the way of actual support regarding increased training or equipment.  The truth is that the single Force concept of trying to merge the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force into a seamless unit is a bit like trying to merge the HSE and Ryanair.  It will take a long time and will require many changes of mentality on both sides.  I emphasise both sides here, not just the Reserve.  In fact, the single Force concept, were it to be properly executed in all its aims and goals, would be far more traumatic to the Permanent Defence Force than ourselves.  At the moment the land-based element of the naval service operates like the army.  That is to say that it operates within a bubble world within the naval base Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.  The navy, like the army, has become very good at wrapping itself up in its own self-imposed regulations and paperwork.  Their idea of a single Force concept is that we operate exactly like they do.  They have made no compromise in the way they operate to incorporate us.  To give a perfect example of this, we were told in early 2013 that just like the naval service, the Naval Service Reserve must use a document called the Manual of Staff Duties when planning and applying for anything.<\/p> <p> The manual of staff duties was hand typed in 1980, so we had to operate to a 34-year old hand-typed document, which could not be removed from the barracks.  I will give three very brief examples of the other kind of non-compromising procedures and bureaucracy that the Naval Service Reserve, NSR, has to contend with in our battle to try to make the single Force concept successful.  The first one is NSR, similar to Army reserve units, are meant to be self-administrating so a prerequisite for the MIF course, which is a course pertaining to logistics and the computer system, is having a European computer driving licence, ECDL.  To do an ECDL in the Defence Forces takes a mere four weeks of solid full-time training while, if one were to do it in the civilian world it would take ten hours in various evening courses.<\/p><p> As Mr. Cooney outlined, we had a recruitment campaign and the fitness tests are now the exact same as for the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, which is to be welcomed.  However, in our unit, the Naval Service ran the fitness tests in the middle of the day over a Tuesday and Wednesday.  The new recruits who wanted to join the Naval Service Reserve were asked to come for a fitness test in Limerick in the middle of the day on a Tuesday and Wednesday.  No consideration was given to the fact that such people are part-time, that they have jobs or are students on courses.  In fairness, the Naval Service learned from the experience and now they will run the fitness tests at the weekend.  However, the suggestion is that the course will be run at the naval base which means people from Limerick and Waterford must travel there.  Why could they not come to us?<\/p><p> The third and final example of what goes on relates to eyesight standards.  Due to a bureaucratic anomaly the Naval Service Reserve must now have a higher eyesight standard than any other branch of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Army Reserve and even the Naval Service itself.  When we proposed a solution to get around the anomaly, the Naval Service looked at it and thanked us and said it made very interesting reading.  Following that, it responded with a half-page e-mail with nine references to our proposal being either &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;, &ldquo;not currently possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo;.  One would think we were trying to land a man on the moon.<\/p><p> Those are just three examples of what we encounter.  The non-compromising paperwork and bureaucracy is being successfully used to waste time.  The changes called for in the value for money report are not being made.  The full list of key performance indicators are not being met.  No preplanning has taken place with us to discuss what changes have to be made, despite several requests from our side of the fence.<\/p><p> Our fear is that the value for money review, which is set for 2016, has been set to coincide with the election and following the election there will be a new Minister for Defence and that sometime after the Easter commemorations the Department of Defence will drop a review report on the new Minister&rsquo;s desk and say it gave the reserve a chance but it could not meet it, and that it is time to disband the reserve.  As the Taoiseach himself recently said, the Civil Service has the best people in the world to write a 300 page report on why things cannot get done.  In order to get where we need to get, what we in the NSR want and need, is a far more positive, flexible and accommodating response from the Naval Service, the Army and the Department of Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Colgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415803800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Colgan.

Could we reserve time in the coming weeks, no later than that, for the committee to engage constructively on the points that have been brought to our attention?  When the Reserve Defence Force representatives came before us in April of last year it is probably true to say that some people felt they were being perhaps a little alarmist.  A year and a half later there is a sense of fatalism in what they have said to us.  I had many questions to put, but what is really needed in the situation is an affirmation on the part of the committee of a recognition of the importance of the Reserve Defence Force.  The reserves are a critical part of the defence structure on this island.  We must look at the issue in the context of the fact that we have pared back our Permanent Defence Force to 9,500 members.  We have the lowest expenditure among neutral countries as a percentage of GDP in the European Union.  The Reserve Defence Force is operating way below its establishment strength.<\/p><p>  We have been asked to conduct a review.  I have one question in that respect.  Is the committee being asked to conduct the review or is it considered that we should secure outside expertise to carry it out on our behalf?  I think I speak for members on all sides when I say that there is a recognition among the body politic of the importance of reservists.  If it is the sense of the witnesses that they have been set up by faceless bureaucrats within a system, the purpose of which is to make them fail, then that is not our ambition for them, which is to see them realise their full potential.

I agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, that members value the Reserve Defence Forces and it is recognised across all the political parties.  However, when one gets down to the nuts and bolts of this debate, it pertains to value for money.  My initial reaction, when hearing that term, is that of course one must be responsible in that one is spending taxpayers' money in respect of the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association.  However, as far as I am concerned, I want commitment and dedication to the job in the Reserve Defence Forces.  That would be my first priority and is what the State should seek.  My first question relates to the association's submission, in which it states that 2,335 reservists must be recruited by 2016 to meet the establishment number and that this will be an extremely difficult target to reach.  That target is a year and a half away.

I am unsure of the exact numbers but in general, one gets perhaps 50 people for that formation and then there are three formations.  As for the current campaign that is ongoing again in the DFTC, I believe there are 80 applicants for that at present.  In general, our figures show that for any one successful recruit, one needs four applicants.  Consequently, just on a statistical level, to recruit 1,000 successful applicants, one would need 4,000 applications.  That said, if one got the interest, the resources are not there to train them.  One needs people on the ground to train reservists and I would challenge any semi-State or State body to recruit 1,000 people in a year in circumstances in which they must have the people undergo medical examinations and security checks, which can take anything from six to 12 weeks, as well as to undergo interviews and the entire process.  Consequently, there are logistical issues with training that number of people, whereby one is trying to bring up part-time personnel on their spare time and using up their previous annual leave.

Originally, in 2013, we had an allocation of &euro;2.3 million but that was reduced.  Moreover, it has been reducing dramatically each year since 2009.  We also had an allocation of 41,000 man-days but that number was slashed to 28,000 last year.  We now have a situation whereby the resource allocation within which we must work is &euro;1.3 million and our man-day allocation is 28,000.  As my colleague stated, if we could recruit, we are prohibited because neither the resource allocation nor the man-day allocation is there.

The VFM review came up with a figure that, as an organisation, we seriously dispute, in that it was &euro;21 million to &euro;22 million.  The RDF has suffered a downwards straight-line graph on its membership since 2009 because in that year, the restrictions came into place.  The precursor to these restrictions happened in 2008 when a recruitment campaign, which had been sanctioned by the Minister, was cancelled permanently.  In 2009, the recruiting restrictions came into place and we were not allowed to recruit more than 400 people, even though the VFM review states that we were losing 1,400 people per annum at that point and the VFM review took account of that.  However, that review contains contradictory statements and therefore, had the number of people been maintained, we would then have an RDF today that could be stood up to 4,000 members.<\/p><p>  The allocation of 4,000 members for the RDF has never come into being because, as my colleague pointed out earlier, in January 2014 we had 1,200 vacancies in the RDF and there still was attrition going on.  One thing that worked against us in a sad way is that people who had been in the RDF in Galway up until the reorganisation were transferred to Cork.  People who were in the RDF in Athlone were transferred to Dublin and people who were in the RDF in Dublin were transferred to Athlone.  The only way in which we see this is that they were discommoded intentionally.  Therefore, we lost all those people and in addition, they managed people out, because we all were given a document in March 2013 on which we were obliged to tick a box indicating whether we wished to go to a new unit, to remain with the old unit in the place it was or to be discharged.  A lot of people were managed out in that way and in consequence, our numbers fell dramatically.  However, the costs incurred did not fall at all and that is the reason for the &euro;21 million.  In a statement earlier in 2013, the Minister stated there would be a 50% reduction in the RDF, which thereby would generate a saving of &euro;11 million.  It is only a paper saving because the same people who were put down as incurring the cost factor of &euro;11 million are still in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF.  That saving is not true but as for the saving on the RDF, in 2008 we cost &euro;7.9 million whereas in 2014, we are costing &euro;1.3 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Mulley"},{"type":"speech","time":1415804400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I refer to the point made about how the reservists may be required to take up to four days in annual leave to meet simple administrative requirements and the submission then referred to using up 60% of reservists' statutory annual leave.

Basically, if one considers the individual KPIs, which are the most important, they are broken down into a medical, a fitness test, a weapons test and one's attendance over the year.  That is the shortest way of looking at it.  The main problem we are having at present is with medicals.  As that is only one quarter of the targets, one might ask what is the problem.<\/p> <p>The problem is that the medical has a knock-on affect in other areas.  A person cannot undergo a fitness test without first undergoing a medical test.<\/p><p> Consideration is being given to the introduction next year of a personal weapons test.  However, taking of the personal weapons test will be, because it is quite a strenuous test, dependent on the person having first passed a medical and fitness test.  Currently, we are being starved of the medical.  We assumed that a new medical, of a less stringent nature, would be introduced for the reserve.  I recently had a medical done.  It included an ECG and blood tests and I was offered vaccinations.  That type of medical is overkill for a reservist.  It might be said that there can be only one standard.  However, there are already different standards in place in that a member of the Air Corps or Naval Service does not have to complete part three of the fitness test.  There is not only one standard even for the PDF.  Standards can be tailored to the commitment or to what is necessary.  We do not want people who fall over, etc., during a fitness test but we do not believe it is necessary to put the taxpayer to the cost of detailed medicals for reservists.<\/p><p> Some of our suggestions in this regard include that a medical examination could be provided at the weekend by the Defence Forces; that the reservist GP provide a medical for the Defence Forces for a set fee, which would allow the reservist to attend his or her GP at a time of their own choosing, be that at the weekend or in the evening; that RDF doctors be activated to help the resources available to conduct medicals; that medicals be done every three years rather than annually, with self-certification being acceptable in the other years; and that consideration be given to the introduction of the type of medicals provided by the Canadian Defence Forces, which are of different frequency and intensity dependent on the type of service in which the person is engaged.  The reason we are harping on this medical target is because it is influencing all of the other targets.  We have been given verbal assurances by the General Staff that we will not be held to these KPIs because they are not providing the resources to us.  However, these assurances are only verbal.  The people by whom they were given may be retired by the time a review is undertaken, which review will consist of a look-back at the targets and assessment of whether or not they were met.<\/p><p> We are asking that the Defence Forces would consider the introduction of a flexible method for the achievement of medicals.

There are four key fundamentals which the reserve forces in this countries have and which ours does not.  These were pretty much glossed over in the value-for-money report.  The first of these fundamentals is operational purpose, which we have just discussed and which is absolutely pivotal.  It is necessary because recruitment and training can be orientated around it.  The second relates to employment protection legislation.  This is both a key enabler and mission critical and it is standard among all our comparator nations.  As stated earlier, it was previously present in section 57 of the Defence Forces Act 1940 but it is no longer there.  We hope that employment protection legislation will be discussed comprehensively in the context of the forthcoming White Paper.  It certainly was not discussed in connection with the value-for-money report.  If reservists do not have any guarantee that their livelihoods are safe, there is no guarantee that we can actually mobilise them.  It is, therefore, really a matter of courtesy to protect reservists who are themselves protecting Ireland.<\/p><p>  Legislation alone does not work.  There must also be employer support and engagement.  It is not sufficient to oblige employers to release reservists for mobilisation and, possibly, training.  There must be engagement between the Department and employers.  This is generally done by all our comparator nations through consultative bodies which bridge the gap between defence and industry.  The establishment of such a group here was recommended in a military board report published in 1999.  To our detriment, however, this recommendation was never pursued.  Again, the White Paper may also address this matter.  It is important that employers understand that there are significant business benefits to employing reservists.  In that context, we learn practical skills, develop personality traits and obtain qualifications during our reserve service which have scalable value.  This position in this regard is outlined in reports relating to and produced by SaBRE, the UK's reservist organisation, which were compiled with the assistance of the Chartered Management Institute.  These reports scaled the cost attributed to reserve training in order to show employers how much that training is worth.  Employers in other nations are also rewarded for supporting and hiring reservists.  In Australia, for example, employers can claim up to $1,400 per week through an employer support payment scheme if they release their reservists for training and deployment.  Such is the importance of supporting employers, there is even an international conference on employer supports for reservists which is held on a biannual basis.  This conference is used to discuss research and experience in order to enhance reserve capability.  To date, however, Ireland has not participated in the conference.  We would like to hope that - going forward - it might be possible for us to consider attending.<\/p><p>  In the international context, all of our comparator nations classify reservists as part-time employees.  The Reserve Defence Force in this country prides itself on being a volunteer organisation.  Unfortunately, however, the removal of the annual gratuity and the policy of measured compulsory volunteerism has led to poor retention rates.  This explains why there is such a deficit among the lower level ranks at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111200008#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rob Gilbey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415805600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>The fundamental point is that this is not something new.

We welcome the opportunity to give our views on these important matters.  I also thank the committee for looking at the Office of the Ombudsman as a whole.  I am sure, as the Chairman has found by looking at the respective ombudsman schemes that we are different bodies, each with a different remit.  Some of us deal with stakeholders in the private sector, others in the public sector.  Some can only make recommendations but others, such as ourselves, make decisions that are legally binding.  Despite the fact that there are many differences, we have things in common, in particular as the committee looks at the respective roles of each of the ombudsmen, I would commend them very much to look at the guide to principles of good governance that have been put forward by the Ombudsman Association.  The Ombudsman Association is an association of the ombudsmen of the UK and Ireland.  All the various Irish ombudsmen are full participants and they look at very different ombudsman schemes - from the financial services ombudsman, the statutory ombudsman to the various private sector ombudsmen.  They deem there are certain principles such as independence and effectiveness that really are principles that should apply across the board.  It is very important for the committee to focus on those types of issues as they look across the ombudsman spectrum.<\/p><p>  I am here primarily to talk to the committee about the work of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  We were set up to be an alternative to the courts.  We are independent and impartial in resolving disputes.  Our particular jurisdiction is that we handle complaints by eligible consumers against regulated financial service providers.  This includes banks, building societies, insurance companies, intermediaries and a host of other providers, which are all regulated providers.<\/p><p>  We were set up in 2005 on a statutory basis as the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Prior to the establishment of the financial services ombudsman, there were voluntary schemes, set up by industry, such as a banking ombudsman, a credit institutions ombudsman and an insurance ombudsman.  Those roles were amalgamated and we were put on a statutory basis.<\/p><p>  We are a statutory officeholder who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers.  It is a requirement that before someone should come to us that he or she engages with the provider first.  The provider is required to inform the eligible consumer of our existence.  If the consumer is not satisfied with the resolution the financial service provider has given, he or she can then complain to us.<\/p><p>  The legislation that established us is the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  It provides that we should deal with complaints efficiently, effectively and fairly, that complaints should be dealt with in an informal and expeditious manner.  We are funded by a levy on the industry, not by the Exchequer, and consumers who make a complaint to us pay no fee and can do so free of charge.<\/p> <p> We operate in a larger institutional framework.  We adjudicate complaints based on principles made by others.  The principal basis on which we adjudicate cases is the consumer protection code and other regulations that are promulgated by the Central Bank.  We are also guided by legislation and general legal principles.  Our decisions are only binding on the parties in front of us.  We do not establish legal precedents.  That is not our job.  We are not a court.  We do not investigate financial service providers.  We do not investigate complainants.  If we come across an issue that we think is of systemic effect, we notify the Central Bank with which we have a very open and productive relationship.  It is up to the Central Bank as the regulator to make an investigation, if it wishes.  It has administrative powers.  It can issue fines and penalties.  We do not issue fines.  We do not award penalties.  We adjudicate individual complaints and we award compensation.<\/p><p> The Financial Services ombudsman is appointed by the Financial Services ombudsman&rsquo;s Council.  He is not a member of the council.  The council operates in a supervisory and advisory capacity.  It is a separate body.  It has no role with regard to how the ombudsman and the bureau deal with a particular complaint.  The ombudsman and the bureau are completely independent, not only of the stakeholders but also of the council.  We have been issuing a report about our complaints twice a year, our biannual review.  The latest one was issued for the second half of last year.  We have given the committee a copy of that review.  It tells a very important story about what has been happening in terms of complaints to our office in the past year.  By way of background, it is important to know that if one considers the financial crisis and the record of complaints before the ombudsman, between 2006 and 2009 the volume of complaints doubled and trebled.  That put a significant strain on the work of the office.  From 2009 to 2013 the complaints levelled off, broadly speaking.  Since the second half of last year, however, there has been a very significant reduction in the numbers of complaints of approximately 50%.<\/p><p> There are several reasons for this.  The complaints were driven by the financial crisis, by people often in very severe financial distress, for example, people who had lost money on their investments.  Complaints about investments in the past 18 months are down by approximately 90%.  We operate under a six-year rule of the Statute of Limitations.  In effect, the people who lost their money when the markets collapsed in 2008 have already made their complaints to us.  People who made their investments in 2009 or 2010 had, by and large, a very different outcome from those who made their investments in a previous period.  There are reductions in complaints across the board.  There are two reasons for that, the first of which is that we have changed our procedures to insist that complainants fully engage with providers before we adjudicate a complaint.  We have found that many people come to us prematurely before they have engaged with the financial provider and we tell them we are here for them if they are unhappy with the resolution the provider gives, but first they must deal with the provider.  They go to the provider and many do not come back to us.<\/p><p> Second, the legislation was changed in the second half of last year to give us the ability to issue reports on the complaint performance of individual financial service providers, and we did this in our first report which we published earlier this year.  It set out a fairly simple league table of the numbers of complaints upheld against financial service providers where during the relevant period, three or more complaints were upheld.  We did this according to the statutory instrument which sets out the way this must be done.<\/p><p> It has been our experience that this single report has had more influence on the behaviour of financial service providers than all the other decisions we had made in the first almost ten years of the office.  There is a renewed sense of engagement by providers, they are trying to settle more cases and are engaging with their customers at all stages in the process, from before the complaint is made to us to very advanced stages of investigation.  We, by and large, consider this to be a good thing because there can only be a settlement if both parties agree.  If someone is not happy with an offer made, that person is fully entitled to adjudicate to continue with the investigation and have us adjudicate the case.  We are very pleased to do that.<\/p><p> The committee has asked us several very specific questions.  I have dealt with some about the role and function of an ombudsman and the rights of citizens.  For us, it is very clear: citizens can make complaints to us if they are eligible consumers and they can do that free of charge.  Another question we were asked was whether the office of any ombudsman should be statutorily based and why.  I have to qualify my answer by saying that in terms of financial services we believe that it should be statutorily based because it means our decisions are legally binding.  Given the history of financial services and their importance, the public needs a manner of clear, effective redress and that can only be given if the body has binding legal powers.<\/p><p> If we turn to the broader network of ombudsmen, there are many voluntary schemes that are not based on statute that effectively provide a very good service.  They are forms of complaint handling.  Often their jurisdictional limit is quite small.  For some of the ombudsmen schemes dealing with telecommunications or other types of commercial services, the remit of the ombudsman may be only &euro;1,000 per complaint - relatively small - whereas ours is &euro;250,000.  Those schemes provide a valuable service.  They can be quite effective provided there is buy-in from the industry, and putting them on a statutory basis may not gain much more.  There are some areas, such as financial services, which because of their importance in people&rsquo;s lives and because it is one area where there is a great disparity in knowledge between the average consumer and the financial institution should be statutorily based.  We have learnt from dealing with people that many of them do not understand the nature of the products they have bought.  They do not understand their rights.  That cries out for the need for effective redress.<\/p><p> Another question is whether each ombudsman should be independently funded directly from the Central Fund.  We are not funded by the Exchequer.  We are funded by a levy on the industry.  That is entirely appropriate.  We inherited a voluntary scheme which was already funded by the industry.<\/p> <p>It is more appropriate for the industry to pay for it than the Exchequer.  Having said that, sometimes when we get letters from people who have made complaints and who are unhappy, they ask how they can expect anything else because we are funded by the industry.  It is very important that when a body is funded by a levy on the industry it has proper governance in place in order that it is independent.  In that sense, we are independent.  The levy is not imposed by the ombudsman or the bureau but by the council, which does it independently of us.  The council takes no part in deciding individual cases.  The independence of an ombudsman, if it is fully enshrined, is compatible with funding by the industry.<br\/>An important question is whether all public bodies should respect and implement in full recommendations made by the ombudsman arising from formal investigations by that ombudsman.  As I said previously, one can broadly separate the world of ombudsmen into two groups, namely, the public and the private ombudsmen.  The public ombudsmen, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or the statutory Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, deal with complaints against public bodies.  We deal with complaints against private bodies, which makes us significantly different.  Public bodies should have a buy-in to the ombudsman process.  If public bodies are able to ignore recommendations of the Ombudsman without giving any reason whatsoever, that obviously undermines its authority.  That is not to say that the Ombudsman is infallible but, clearly, in respect of the public ombudsmen, there must be some thought given to the integrity of their decisions.  We, however, are in a very different space.  We do not deal with public bodies but with private ones and our decisions are legally binding.  To that extent, our decisions can be fully and completely implemented by the parties concerned.  If, for example, a financial service provider does not implement one of our decisions, there are provisions in place which allow us to take the provider to court.  By and large, the only circumstances in which our decisions and findings are not implemented by the financial service provider are when that provider has gone out of business or into liquidation.  At that point, there is nothing that anyone can do in terms of enforcement.<br\/>On the question of the threshold for a government which wishes to reject a report from an ombudsman, this is something that the public ombudsmen would be better able to comment on rather than us.  The impartiality of the ombudsman is both a matter of fact and perception and the prestige of access to independent redress by citizens is also a matter of perception.  In that context, we have been asked for our views on how this should be strengthened.  Independence is at the absolute heart of what we must be.  If we are not independent, in both fact and perception, we cannot do our job.  Again, that is enshrined in legislation, as follows:<blockquote>The Financial Services Ombudsman is entitled to perform the functions imposed, and exercise the powers conferred, by this Act free from interference by any other person and, when dealing with a particular complaint, is required to act in an informal manner and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the complaint without regard to technicality or legal form.<\/blockquote>We believe that independence is extremely important.  We have to be able to investigate complaints free from all interference.  There are also very important governance aspects to the tenure of the ombudsman.  The Ombudsman Association argues that the recommended term of office should be a minimum of five years.  Everyone understands the importance of the independence of the Judiciary and we all accept that it must be free from any type of influence.  That is why judges are given, in many cases, lifetime tenure.  We are not asking for that but we believe that a minimum tenure of five years is appropriate, given the fact that we have a quasi-judicial function at the very least.  We also believe that the salary of the officeholder should be tied to a Civil Service grade and not simply a single salary point.<br\/>Effectiveness is also very important.  We must continue to have the necessary powers and ability to provide an aggrieved complainant with an adequate remedy.  As one looks across the spectrum of other ombudsmen, this is a question that must be focused on.  What can the other ombudsmen do to compensate an aggrieved party?  If they cannot do that, there is no incentive for anyone to make a complaint to them.  If an ombudsman is not getting complaints, then he or she is not really an ombudsman.  My office has a very wide jurisdiction to give a complainant effective relief.  If someone has made an investment and makes a case that he or she was mis-sold that investment, I have the legal powers to direct that the investment be returned to the financial service provider and the individual can get all of his or her money back, irrespective of jurisdictional limit.  That is a very clear-cut example of how we can give an individual an adequate remedy.  It is very important to look at this issue through that lens in the context of other ombudsmen.<br\/>The final question is whether all bodies and entities providing goods and services, whether delivered by the private or public sector, should be subject to the remit of the ombudsman.  The statutory Ombudsman has spoken about this and it is a question that is more relevant for him.  That said, we would agree with his position.  If services were provided by the public sector previously  - and under the public regime, a complaint could be made to the Ombudsman - the privatisation of those services provides no reason to deny aggrieved consumers the ability to access the Ombudsman.  It should not make any difference whether the service provider is in public or private ownership in terms of the public having access to an ombudsman scheme.<br\/>I am very happy to answer any further questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415809200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Prasifka and his team and thank them for appearing before this committee.  A number of thoughts struck me as I listened to Mr. Prasifka's opening statement, particularly on the broader ombudsman issues.  I have a particular interest in the Irish language and one of the points regularly made by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga relates directly to what Mr. Prasifka said, namely, that if an ombudsman cannot impose appropriate sanctions, then he or she is not really an ombudsman.  That is an issue which we will be discussing further with the language commissioner, who does not seem be enjoying the co-operation of various Departments and semi-State bodies because they do not see the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they do not do what he recommends.  He tries to cajole them and bring them along.  It is interesting to see that in the case of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the sanctions that can be imposed actually work.  The so-called name and shame table issued by the Financial Services Ombudsman seems to have worked very well and I applaud his office for that.  Many people believe that if financial institutions are not acting properly they should be named and shamed publicly.<\/p><p>  I note that there does not seem to be a large number of complaints relating to credit unions and I ask Mr. Prasifka to elaborate on that issue.  I apologise for not going through everything in detail but it appears to me that there seem to be more complaints made against the larger institutions in the financial services sector.<\/p> <p>Given that there have been a number of issues around some credit unions that have been amalgamated or have got into trouble, is there a reason there is not as much around that area?  Is the ombudsman happy with the powers he has or is there an extension of the remit that he would like?  The statutory Ombudsman has named a number of areas where it feels we should have jurisdiction in this area because we get complaints and we cannot deal them.  Are there particular areas from which the ombudsman receives a body of complaints but which are outside his remit and where he would be open to having the remit extended to cover them?  <\/p><p> Mr. Prasifka said that for the decisions to be legally binding it is important for the office of the Ombudsman to be statutorily based.  What discussions has he had with the Department and the relevant Ministers in this regard and what has been their response when he has sought these powers?<\/p><p> The health insurance industry is an area in which everybody gets mind boggled.  If one seeks to change one's policy from one provider to another, it is very difficult to compare and contrast the prices.  If Mr. Prasifka sees a body of complaints arriving around a particular matter, does he issue a recommendation that perhaps the industry should look at homogenising the way it presents the information to the consumer in order that it is easier to compare and contrast and, if so, what mechanisms are in place for changing the way financial services present their products and services and how successful has he been? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200005#E00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415809800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I will get a response to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200006#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1415809800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>May I ask one final question?

I agree completely with the Senator that the effectiveness of a remedy is the most important thing.  The ombudsman is there to decide individual complaints so the remedy must be there for the aggrieved party.  The ombudsman is not a regulator.  The office is not there to award a penalty or to issue a fine but to award compensation, to give a remedy to a person.  That is very important because if someone has no remedy, why should he or she make a complaint?  If one is not getting complaints, one is not in the business of being an ombudsman.  As the committee goes through the other ombudsmen, one has to ask what is there for a person to make a complaint?  For us, we have the full powers so maybe, in some regard. we are best in the class.  One has to look at it with that lens for other ombudsmen.<\/p><p>  The second point was about name and shame.  I can tell the committee it has been our experience that there are many financial institutions who are extremely concerned about potential reputational damage that may come to them by featuring prominently or, in some cases, featuring at all in our table.  To be in our table one has to have three or more complaints.  It is inevitable that for the largest institutions that they will always be there given the volume of business they do.  It is an important lesson.  We always had full legal powers.  We had full legal powers to award a good deal of compensation but for many institutions we only really got their attention when we had the ability to report on their individual performance.  There is a lesson there for some of the other ombudsmen.  <\/p><p>  In terms of credit unions, it is interesting to note that I am speaking to some people in the credit unions tomorrow so we have the number of complaints there to hand.  In the past couple of years, complaints about credit unions have averaged just under 1% of the total number of complaints.  This year, they are running at approximately 0.5%.  By any context, given the size of the business that is a very good performance.  Why is that?  We have looked at this for a number of years.  It is clear that its product portfolio is simpler, it is relationship based and community based.  Where one gets into trouble with people in the financial service providers is if there is no relationship.  So much of what we do is looking at whether there is a match-up between the product that is sold and the person who bought it.  If one is dealing with an institution which has the customer today, has had them for a number of years, and hopes to have them for the rest of their life, and if they are relationship based they will know the customer better and are more interested in selling them products that will make them want to come back.  We think those are very important issues.  We receive relatively few complaints about credit unions.  Perhaps that is something they should speak about more and it is to their advantage.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked if we need any additional powers.  On a broad level, the answer is \"No\".  We have full powers.  In terms of our proposed amalgamation with the pensions ombudsman, we have been looking at the powers of the pensions ombudsman versus the powers that we have and we have found a few anomalies.  For example, when the pensions ombudsman does an investigation, it has the power to compel third parties to give it information if it deems it relevant to its investigation of a complaint.  We only have the power to compel the financial service provider for information.  Often, what happens in, say, the case of an investment product is that the sale is made by a financial adviser who is the agent of the financial service provider and that person has left the company.  We have taken legal advice on this issue.  We have no power to compel that person to give us information or to appear if we have an oral hearing.  Sometimes that is the critical witness and we have no power in that area.  As we are looking at amending the legislation, that may be one area where we would look for additional powers.<\/p><p>  The Senator raised the issue of health insurance.  We deal with health insurance on a daily basis.  We had noticed there was an increase in health insurance complaints going back three and four years ago.  This was understandable because the market was becoming more complicated.  We had gone from a position of one or two providers to more providers.  There were different types of policies and it was clear that a number of complaints were driven by the fact that people did not really understand the coverage they had or the coverage they were getting.  We did have a number of complaints in this area. This is one where we make the individual decisions.  If we think there are any systemic issues we refer them to the Central Bank but we are not there to give industry guidelines.  That is not our job.  Our job is to adjudicate individual complaints.  Hopefully the industry will learn from that but in terms of further regulations, industry guidelines, these are issues for the regulator and not for ourselves. <\/p><p>  The Senator's last question was how I think the committee could be of benefit to us.  I welcome the committee looking at the ombudsman's spectrum across all of us.  What I would like to see the committee do is to look at the principles of good governance of the Ombudsman Association in the context of each ombudsman.  How are they living up to that?  Are they effective?  Are they independent?  If not, why not, and how can they be made better?  That is how I think they be of benefit to us.<\/p> <p>I am well aware that while we have full powers, many of our fellow ombudsmen do not.  There is a useful role for the committee in examining those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Prasifka and his colleagues for their very clear presentation.  I apologise if the answers to any of my questions were included in the annual report of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and I simply could not find them.  Mr. Prasifka expressed the view that the levy is the appropriate way to fund his office rather than direct Exchequer funding.  Without meaning in any way to impugn the work the delegates do, there is always the possibility that some people will say that because the office is being paid for by the industry, it might not be as independent as one would like.  Have the delegates found that any of their members are reluctant to pay the levy and, if so, what recourse does the office have, or is this not really an issue?<\/p><p>  Most of the other ombudsmen who have appeared before the committee observed that they often encounter delays in getting information from Departments and other bodies and experience a level of non-co-operation.  Where they make findings, we were told, there is sometimes a problem with their implementation and, in some cases, they are just plain ignored.  I note that the delegates' annual report makes no reference to any of these types of problems.  This might mean they are not experiencing such difficulties or it could be that they are just not referred to in the report.  Will Mr. Prasifka clarify that?<\/p><p>  The Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman offers the right to mediation, but only a very small number of cases have ended up in mediation and only six were resolved by that route.  Is this low rate because mediation is still a very new process or is it simply the case that it does not work in many instances?  Does Mr. Prasifka have an observation on the role of mediation in general?  As a society, it is surely something we ought to embrace more widely.  I am pleased the option is there, albeit on a small scale.  Perhaps the intention is to expand it.  If a complainant is dissatisfied with the ombudsman's findings, is that the end of the line or does he or she have the right of appeal to the ombudsman?<\/p><p>  Mr. Prasifka indicated that where a matter is found to be of systemic concern, his office will refer it to the Central Bank.  Does that happen often?  Mr. Prasifka observed that his office has a good and open relationship with the Central Bank.  If information on referrals is not included in the annual report, does he agree it should it be included in the interests of transparency?  If the office is discovering issues that have a systemic quality, should it not report them and say it has done so?<\/p><p>  Mr. Prasifka noted that the Financial Services Ombudsman office is not obliged to feed into the setting up of rules or guidelines.  Is there a relationship, either formal or informal, with the regulator whereby the office can feed in its expertise and findings, or do the delegates expect the regulator to read what they have done and take its own findings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Regarding the levy, I acknowledge the public perception issue that might arise from the fact that we are effectively funded by the industry.  The difficulty is that the choices are rather stark in this regard.  Would it be better to have the office funded directly by the taxpayer?  I have said that the levy is effectively paid for by the industry, but it is really paid for by customers as well.  It is a cost of doing business.  Best international practice in this area is for bodies like ours to be paid for by the industry, that is, by the people who are using the financial services products that are being regulated.  However, as I said, there is the danger that people will deem us to be not independent, which is why we must have proper structures of governance in place.  It is very important that the ombudsman is seen to be clearly independent.<\/p><p>  Regarding our ability to collect the levy, the only issue we have in this regard is with very small providers.  Our remit covers everything from the largest financial institutions, banks and insurance companies down to two-person operations providing intermediary or broker services.  During the contraction of recent years, many of those smaller providers went out of business.  There is no real issue in terms of collecting the levy from 98% plus of the bodies we regulate.  We are dealing with regulated financial service providers - companies which must have the licence - and that puts them into a separate category.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked whether we experience any element of non-co-operation when it comes to implementing our findings.  As I said, our findings are legally binding and are generally implemented.  The only exception we have found is in circumstances where a company goes out of business and is in liquidation or receivership.  In such cases we would be in contact with the receiver.  The Senator is correct that there is no reference to this issue in our annual report.  That is because it is not really an issue for us.  It is only an issue where parties go out of business, but at that point nobody can collect a judgment against them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Does what Mr. Prasifka is saying also apply to the way in which companies co-operate with the ombudsman's office in terms of coming before it, providing paperwork and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Sometimes, by the time a complaint is made to us, the company is already in liquidation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1415810400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I was referring not to companies in liquidation but ongoing concerns with which the ombudsman's office is dealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00600","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415810400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>We have specific timelines within which we expect companies to engage with us, and most concur with those timelines.

When I say \"mediation\" I am referring to formal mediation where both parties come into our office and meet with our staff members who are trained as mediators and can work to facilitate agreement.  We are required, under the legislation, to offer mediation, but it can only happen where both parties consent to it.  Many providers are not willing to give that consent because, in their view, they have already made their case and, in some cases, have already made a settlement offer.  They are not willing to go any further.<\/p><p>  Having said that, the incidence of settlements has been increasing in recent years.  \"Settlement\" simply means the parties talking to each other, which we encourage.  I always make the point in regard to mediation that we fully understand it is never going to be a means of resolving most or a large number of cases.  By the time complaints have been made, positions have hardened.  Mediation will only take place when both parties come forward with a willingness to compromise and meet somewhere in the middle.  However, I tell providers every time I see them that there is scope for more than one mediation per month.  Many of the companies that have availed of it have found it to be beneficial.  It is a means of resolving those cases where parties are willing to compromise.  The take-up is not that high but, as I said, more cases are being settled, which is a good thing.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked where people can go if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of their appeal and whether we have an internal mechanism for dealing with such cases.<\/p> <p>The simple answer is that there is no internal mechanism.  The courts have stated our findings are legally binding.  If either party, the complainant or the financial service provider, is dissatisfied, they can appeal to the courts.  That is where they have to go.<\/p><p> In response to the question about systemic concern and how we report to the Central Bank, we have a very open relationship and meet it formally every quarter and copies of findings go directly to it from time to time, which raises issues.  We occasionally have a follow-up with it on where certain matters have gone.  We are not the regulator.  The information goes to the Central Bank.  We have a memorandum of understanding with it, which allows us to exchange information on a broad range of issues.  We are the Ombudsman and the Central Bank is the regulator.  The Ombudsman can be a very good early warning system, particularly during turbulent times.  We see many issues before others would.  All of our information feeds into the Central Bank which can use it for a variety of means.  It can use it to prioritise where it will work and carry out investigations; it can even assist it in identifying areas of concern and certain financial service providers.  At the end of the day, it is up to the regulator.  We are there to adjudicate on cases and provide the regulator with information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200007#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415811000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I thank the Ombudsman's office for its report and submission.

We must have the same methodology.  There are a couple of reasons we do not uphold more complaints, one of which is that many complaints are driven by people in financial distress; they simply do not have the money and this may be their last throw of the dice and their only means of dealing with the issue.  We hope that as the economy begins to improve and more people are working, there will be fewer people in financial distress.  That would help to reduce complaint levels.  The second reason is that it is quite obvious to us that there are many people who do not fully understand the products they have bought, how they work or what their rights are; therefore, they make a complaint to us and we consider it independently.  We have a very experienced and well trained staff who are engaged in continuous education, many of whom have many years of experience in the area and are familiar with the various products on offer and policies in place and can give people an independent view of their rights.  I have always believed it is a very important service that we provide, to give people at least the reassurance that someone with experience and expertise has considered their issues.<\/p> <p>I have been in this job almost five years and my experience is that we get very few frivolous complaints.

Must a person making a complaint against a service provider prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complaint is justified or is it decided on the balance of probability?

As far as I was concerned the complainants were honest and the complaints were true but the bank simply said \"you cannot prove it so tough luck\".  In one case the person was a long-standing customer of a financial institution and there was not enough money at stake for anyone to believe the customer was playing fast and loose with the institution to make a few bob.

We fully understand the difficulty that some people face as they believe that when they buy a critical illness policy and something happens, they will get paid.  People learn, on reading policies, that only certain types of illness are covered and some of the definitions are very technical.  We go through these matters on a case-by-case basis and we first examine what the contract says.<\/p> <p>In terms of disclosures, the common law rule in Ireland is one of <i>uberrima fides<\/i>.  The contract of insurance is one of utmost good faith.  There is an obligation of disclosure but there is also an obligation on the financial service provider to ask the right questions.  We have had a number of cases where financial service providers were claiming non-disclosure in circumstances where they had simply failed to ask the relevant questions properly or clearly enough in order to place the burden back onto the customer.  This is a matter with which we deal all the time.  Ultimately, what we want to happen is not for us to be obliged to uphold more complaints but rather for standards to be raised.  What needs to be done in some of these areas is that more information must be provided at point of sale so that people will be better informed when they are buying the product.  That is why we are taking some degree of satisfaction from an overall drop in the number of complaints, particularly if this is an indication that standards are improving.  One element of better performance is for providers to settle more cases after complaints have been made.  An even better way of dealing with the situation is to obviate the need for people to make complaints as a result of providers changing their practices.  We have seen some progress in this regard.  We take a very firm view that the burden must be on the provider to ask the correct questions and to do this in a way that is understandable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014111200009#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415812200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>How was this demonstrated to Mr. Prasifka's office?

The industry sees this meeting as part of an ongoing dialogue with Deputies and Senators regarding these issues.  The TIF is the representative body for the industry and its members include all companies making significant investments in telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland.  The ICIA is an alliance of the mobile network providers.  All ICIA members are also members of the TIF.  My presentation is industry-specific and is not connected to any particular company.  If members have queries about specific locations or individual customers, we will be happy to take those on board and the companies will respond off-line, as it were, as we do not have the information with us today to go into that level of detail.<\/p><p>  Our industry wants to work with Government and members of this committee so that a high quality communications network is available to all homes and business premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The telecommunications sector is an important contributor to Ireland's society and economy.  It employs 18,000 people throughout the country and generates &euro;1.4 billion in taxation, or 3% of total revenue.  It provides innovative new services that continue to transform life in the workplace and at home.  It is paying &euro;843 million to the Irish Exchequer in licence fees as a result of the 2012 spectrum auction.  It has invested &euro;2.5 billion in Ireland's telecommunications infrastructure in the past five years.  Taken together, this amounts to an investment by industry of &euro;3.2 billion over the last five years, which is equal to Ireland's entire public capital programme for 2014.  This enormous investment took place throughout the economic crisis in Ireland - during the bailout period - and was a major vote of confidence in the Irish economy, as was stated by Government when the results of the spectrum auction were announced.  Similar substantial capital investment will be made over the next few years to upgrade the core communications infrastructure by rolling out fibre and 4-G mobile.  <\/p><p>  Some 97% of households subscribe to mobile telephone services, 85% to pay-TV services, 78% to broadband services and 69% to fixed telephone services.  There is near-universal availability of basic broadband at 3 Mbps, and of mobile telephone services.  By June 2016 fixed or cable network fibre high-speed broadband services are projected to reach 1.6 million homes and businesses.  Fibre and cable broadband services deliver speeds in the 100 to 200 Mbps range.  There is over 100% population penetration for mobile telephony, with 59% of individuals using smart phones.  As ComReg said to this committee last month, the mobile operators have always significantly exceeded the coverage conditions of their licenses, as set by the State.  4-G roll-out has commenced, with some 300,000 active 4-G subscriptions.  Over the next three years 4-G will be rolled out nationally, including to those areas covered by the national broadband scheme.  <\/p><p>  The telecommunications market is highly competitive with approximately 50 operators, and several new entrants have been announced recently.  Despite sector revenue decreasing, the industry is continuing to invest.  Where it is commercially viable, companies will provide high-speed broadband, whether fixed, cable or mobile, by making the necessary major investment in telecommunications infrastructure.  In areas where it is not commercially viable, this investment is to be made by Government through a public tender.  The industry engages with Government regarding the roll-out of high-speed broadband through participation at chief executive level on the Government's next generation broadband task force.  <\/p><p>  As members are aware, last April the Government announced an initiative for State funding for a major roll-out of fibre in rural areas to make a high-speed broadband network available to all homes and business premises, regardless of location.  TIF supports this initiative and the industry is working intensively with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to help with this project.  Accelerated commercial investment by industry has taken place since 2012.  The Department informed this committee that the result of this is that the area to be addressed by the State scheme has been reduced by half.  Support from committee members for this initiative and for future investment by industry would be invaluable.  In particular, the industry would welcome the committee's support in overcoming unnecessary local barriers to telecommunications infrastructure so that high-speed broadband and 4-G can be provided in every locality.<\/p><p>  Broadband and mobile provision in rural Ireland is challenging because of where our people live.  We not only have a relatively low population density but even more significantly, our population is incredibly dispersed across the landscape.  Taking density first, the UK is four times more densely populated than Ireland, with 263 people per square kilometre.  Ireland has 67 people per square kilometre on average while rural Ireland averages approximately 26 people per square kilometre.  Our population dispersal is even more significant.  Over 25% of our population lives in what the OECD calls \"remote\" rural regions, namely, villages with fewer than 50 homes, compared to an EU average of 11%.  The extent to which our rural population is dispersed is unique.  Rural broadband in Ireland thus requires relatively more telecommunications infrastructure, in terms of masts and fibre, than elsewhere.  Natural features such as hills, valleys and even trees, can degrade signal quality.  When making planning applications, telecommunications operators seek to locate masts so as to overcome these obstacles and transmit signals as effectively as possible.<\/p> <p>Masts are used to provide broadband as well as mobile telephone services.  Issues with the planning system and planning processes are a significant barrier.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, concluded that reform of local planning regulations would help to avoid worsening the urban-rural digital divide.  Levies, bonds and inconsistency of approach by local authorities regarding telecommunications infrastructure and road openings are a further barrier.  Lack of consistency among State agencies in terms of access to State property for telecommunications infrastructure is an additional barrier.  Steep increases in network rates payable to local authorities, as indicated by the Valuation Office, is another emerging problem.<\/p><p> The industry would welcome support from committee members with local authorities and State agencies regarding the barriers outlined above.  We acknowledge the support provided to the industry in addressing such barriers by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p> The speed at which investment happens will be critically dependent on the continuation of a pro-investment environment and improved co-ordination among local authorities and State agencies.  The continued roll-out of high speed broadband and 4-G has a dual significance for Ireland's economic recovery: first, the immediate employment provided by network construction and, second, and more importantly, the longer-term role of high speed broadband and 4-G in facilitating job creation at local level.  We welcome the Government's commitment to encourage demand for high speed broadband by measures to fund training to promote information technology, IT, literacy across society to make online services accessible to all and measures to assist small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to develop an online presence to serve their customers.<\/p><p> Significant investments in cable, fixed and mobile infrastructure are required.  There are clear economic and social benefits from advanced telecommunications.  Co-operation between operators, the Government, local authorities and State agencies is critical to making progress.  A more co-ordinated approach by local government and State agencies will make investment happen faster.<\/p><p> I reiterate that operators are willing to engage on a one-to-one basis with members of the committee or other Members of the Oireachtas on specific issues as required, as is our organisation.  We will be happy to answer any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Torlach Denihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415785200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Thank you for that overview of the &euro;2.5 billion investment and everything that is happening.  The view of the committee since we started examining this is that everybody accepts that the train is coming down the track, as it were, but the difficulty is that there is a huge demand for broadband from SMEs and so forth.  They know they must facilitate online shopping and have an online presence.  At present, online shopping worldwide is valued at &euro;5.9 billion and the target for 2020 is approximately &euro;20 billion, so people must get into that space.  Businesses are being told that continually, but it is not happening fast enough.  That is the issue.  Everybody agrees it will be widespread in a few years but the gap is what we do in the meantime when the economy is picking up and there is growth.<\/p><p>  While the issue with broadband is that it is not coming into place fast enough, the issue with the mobile telephone situation is that it is regressing, particularly in the past few years.

We recognise that the services and the demand for services are growing on our network and that our customers' expectation is growing constantly.<\/p><p>  How they use our services is changing, for example, where they put their telephones in cars.

We constantly continue to push the technology and to push the solutions we are providing.  In parallel, customers' expectations and use of our network change.<\/p><p>  One effect of the investment we are carrying out on the network is that it requires intervention on the network, so from time to time customers will experience a degradation as a result of our activities on the network.

It is probably one of the largest delegations to appear before the committee, but there is an enormous issue with regard to broadband and mobile telephone coverage.<\/p><p>  With regard to the presentation, I am not sure whether the witness is seeking an apology from the Irish people for where they are living or for the dispersed population, but that is the position.  We must be serious about this.  It is the most frustrating issue I encounter on a daily basis.  There is no need for the Government to encourage the population to engage with broadband services for their businesses.  Every business, small trader, family, household and farmer is using broadband and the Internet.  They are seeking it for their business because that is where business is going, so that is where they are going.<\/p><p>  However, there is huge frustration with broadband.  There are constantly new schemes for broadband, particularly in the areas the witness outlined in the presentation.  The industry uses the phrase that it is \"not commercially viable\" for broadband provision in these areas and State aid must be provided.  An initiative for a new broadband scheme was announced by the Government last April, but what was omitted from the announcement was the fact that it would have to seek state aid approval from the European Union and it appears that it will not be presented to the European Union until sometime early in 2015.  When people hear this they become hugely frustrated.<\/p><p>  The witness referred to the rural-urban digital divide.  It is a massive divide.<\/p> <p>People are telling me where they have to go to seek broadband services.  I do not need to detail specific households or businesses that need them.  Everybody needs the best possible broadband service available and there is huge frustration and at this stage almost anger about it.  While I appreciate the figures the delegates have announced for the amounts of money invested, if one tells this to the people who looking for services, they become even more frustrated.  <\/p><p> The Chairman alluded to mobile phone services.  There is no question or doubt that there are areas of the country where the mobile phone service has deteriorated on a continuous basis.  It is not just that there is an issue in some places only; one telephones the service providers only to be told there is ongoing maintenance and that proper coverage will be restored in a couple of weeks.  There are areas in which there has been no mobile phone coverage in the past year and a half in which previously there had been very good coverage.  <\/p><p> In looking at Departments and planning processes there are a number of issues that come to mind.  I think the percentage of the country without a broadband service is 22%.  From what I can gather, there are places ten or 15 miles from major centres of population in which there are no broadband services.  While we can applaud the amounts that have been spent, there is a major issue related to the rural-urban divide that must be tackled in a significant way.  There have been a number of schemes in the past few years, but we are still not getting there.  There seems to be no seriousness on the part of the industry to target the issue.  I would love to find out what is meant by the term \"commercially viable\" and what returns the industry needs or is prepared to accept for a service to be commercially viable.  There are thousands of people, including families and small businesspeople, who are travelling a mile or two to receive emails and contact suppliers and others they must contact.  The Oireachtas, the Government and this committee must tackle this issue in a very serious way because it is one of the major issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200004#D00600","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415785800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>First, the industry shares the frustration felt by Deputy Michael Moynihan's constituents.  There was certainly no intent on our part to seek an apology from anyone.  As a proud Limerick man married to a proud Leitrim woman, I certainly would not seek to move into that territory.  <\/p><p>  In respect of broadband and mobile phone coverage, it is a little like a Deputy being compared to an MP in Great Britain.  There are 600 odd MPs who can cover 60 million people in the United Kingdom in a more straightforward way because of population dispersal.  Members of the committee must cover far more miles to talk to their constituents.  It is the same challenge for us - we must run more cable and more infrastructure is required.<\/p><p>  The urban-rural divide is a really serious issue.  The industry is very keen to sell more product and service more customers - that is how we make money.  We will go wherever it is commercially viable to provide a service.  Ours are commercial entities that must fund investment and sustain employment.  The answer to the problem of the rural-urban divide lies in part in addressing the barriers I mentioned but also in the Government scheme announced which offers a way forward.  <\/p><p>  I will ask some of my colleagues to comment on some of the specific challenges in providing rural broadband and mobile phone services.  Mr. Galvin from eircom will talk about some of the challenges in providing rural broadband services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Torlach Denihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415785800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>As Mr. Denihan said, the industry identifies with the frustration felt by people about the broadband and mobile phone issue.  When we talk about scale of market intensity, we are not suggesting we have a problem with social planning generally.  All we are saying is scale is hugely important for any utility industry, be it electricity, water and sewerage or telecommunications.  As it is a very capital-intensive industry, we must make a commercial return and the reason we must make a commercial return is very simple.  If we do not make reasonable profits, we cannot plough them back into extending the network we develop; therefore, it is an iterative process.  It is very important to understand what \"commercial viability\" means and I might refer to our understanding of the Government's view in respect of the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Denihan outlined, perhaps compared to three years ago, one of the reasons customer frustration has become very sharp, particularly in the past year, is that as the industry rolls out high-speed broadband into communities that three years ago would never have anticipated receiving it, while communities in every county in Ireland can access high speed fibre-based broadband, not everybody can access it.  In the case of the fixed network, we are involved in a three year national upgrade programme and any programme of this scale in terms of an infrastructure upgrade takes time and planning.  Inevitably, when one starts to do it, the frustration for those who do not receive it immediately builds.  Therefore, the frustration of those living in what we call black spots is completely understandable.  The challenge identified by the Deputy and the Chairman is whether the industry can identify with this - we do - and develop a process to accelerate the development of broadband services.  In that context and certainly in the case of the fixed network, we have accelerated our plans and now intend to have 1.6 million premises accessing high speed broadband in 2016 at the end of the three year programme.  <\/p><p>  In respect of the communities that will ultimately be served during that time, there will still be a residual number of people who will not have broadband.  The outcome of the industry collaboration with the Government two years ago was a recognition that there was a line between the commercial market and the market that was difficult to serve and that we needed a collegiate approach to solving that problem.  The industry supports the Government's conclusion - that at some point in respect of where the line is drawn, people generally assume the ratio should possibly be 70%:30%.  It may not be that figure; it may be higher or lower as the industry develops the network.  However, the industry generally endorses the Government's conclusion that if we are to eliminate the digital divide, it must be collaborative.  The Government has signalled that it intends to identify those areas in which it cannot be proved the service is commercial.  That will change as we roll out the service because the degree of commerciality improves depending on how it is rolled out.  At that stage, the Government will intervene.  Our message to it, of which it is aware, is that we should do this quickly and get it right first time.  That is what the industry is committed to doing in the context of the national broadband plan.  Whenever tender is issued, we will respond to it as an industry in a competitive way.  The solution is available to be implemented.  The challenge for the industry is to manage expectations and the frustration felt in the interim period.  <\/p><p>  That is my comment on the overall solution in respect of rural broadband services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Galvin"},{"type":"speech","time":1415785800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for joining us.  This is something that annoys everybody, including me.  I am sure it also annoys the delegates when they are driving around the country or trying to find coverage.  As mentioned, representatives of ComReg and the Department for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago.  I explained to them that I had put up a comment on my Facebook page a few days previously asking people to tell me about black spots.  I received quite a number of comments, but, unfortunately, some of those who replied did not specify whether they were talking about phone coverage, O2 or Vodafone; therefore, I decided to look at the figures to see what people in County Meath were paying specifically for phone coverage.  <\/p><p>  I know that the average phone bill is about &euro;24 per month, which seems very low seeing as I use my phone a lot.  However, if we take it that the figure is &euro;280 per year, we are paying prices that are 40% higher than those in most European countries.  Perhaps the delegates might explain the reason for this?  There are over 5 million phones subscribed.  We do not have a population of 5 million, which means that many people have two phones.  There are 184,000 people living in County Meath.  If one was to say 140,000 of these had phones, just under &euro;40 million is going to mobile phone companies every year.<\/p> <p>The comments that were relayed back to me a number of weeks ago would not show that this amount of funding is going into County Meath or where that funding is going, because the quality of signal is desperate.  I explained that on leaving my house to go to work, if I turn left I cannot get telephone coverage for 15 minutes, if I turn right I cannot get telephone coverage for 15 minutes, and if I go behind my home onto a national road, I cannot get telephone coverage for 15 minutes.  Where is this investment going?  While there is talk of upgrading to fibre and to 3G or 4G, what about normal signal for people talking on the phone?  The purpose of telephones is to be able to talk on them, and if this is to be jeopardised in order to improve data services, I note that after driving home last night I was not complaining that I was unable to download the latest series of \"Family Guy\" or something; I was complaining because I was unable to use my telephone.  If the basic utility for which a telephone was actually created is to be jeopardised for all these purposes, what is the point?  My question to the telephone companies is whether the focus of all the upgrading they are doing is specifically on data.  If so, is there any way in which it can be pulled back to ensure that a proper, basic service is in place before we start to look for all the bells and whistles and everything else it is stated that people are seeking?<\/p><p> On the Internet and broadband, the national broadband plan obviously is welcome.  I understand that companies cannot get everywhere and that there are quite rural parts of Ireland.  While that is fine, for those areas in which companies such as Eircom state they will deliver, they should do so.  I acknowledge the point was being made that Eircom, for example, has black spots in a particular area.  However, to be specific, although people in Dunboyne have been receiving a service from Eircom for years, there is still a black spot comprising approximately five houses.  I am dealing with a woman in one of them who could work from home if she could get telephone coverage, but she cannot.  When one follows up on this issue, one is told one must wait for the broadband plan coming from the Government.  If the Internet companies are in an area, they should be servicing that entire area and not simply leaving it to the Government.  I seek a comment on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200005#E00400","speaker":"1180","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415786400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and will make a couple of points.

Again, we share the Deputy's frustration, because a dropped call is missed revenue from a company's perspective.  It is interesting that the National Roads Authority, NRA, has the power to charge telecommunications companies for use of the existing ducts that run along its roads.  Unfortunately, the charges associated with accessing these ducts are so prohibitive that it is cheaper for operators to actually build their own.  Consequently, there is a whole range of issues there.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a number of issues, including prices, the quality of mobile coverage and the issue pertaining to Dunboyne.  Perhaps if we can take the Dunboyne issue offline, Eircom can follow up with the Deputy later, unless Mr. Galvin wishes to add anything.  I will ask my colleague Dr. Gary Healy to comment on prices and then Mr. Mark Hughes, from 3 and O2, to talk about some of the mobile coverage issues mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Torlach Denihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415786400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Price obviously is a key issue for us in the industry.  We all compete across this table with one another for customers and so, as Mr. Denihan noted, if we have a bad service or bad coverage we risk losing customers.  However, in terms of the numbers on prices, since the start of the recession, although the inflation rate has risen slightly - by approximately 1% - prices for communications services have fallen by approximately 5% to 6% in the same period.  This reflects the level of competition for customers across the country.  We normally measure prices through what is called the average revenue per user and that number is published by ComReg in its quarterly reports.  In the past 12 months, that number has fallen by 7% - that is, from &euro;27 down to approximately &euro;25.  This is happening across Europe, where all mobile users are seeing lower prices.  However, the reduction across Europe is approximately 5.5%, whereas in Ireland we are seeing a reduction of 7%, which actually is a reflection of the level of competition.<\/p><p>  On County Meath and investment, we are constantly looking at investment in all counties.  As for our coverage, we test our network quality.  Across the industry, there are approximately 250 sites in County Meath.  These sites must be maintained and we must consider how well those sites are being used, as well as looking at the alternative sites.  It is a constant and expensive process, and that is where the investment goes for all operators - looking at those areas where, for example, we are unable to deal with data and consequently must improve our site for 3G or 4G.  In addition, we look at new sites where we find there are black spots, and this is a constant and ongoing engineering challenge that we face.  I might ask Mr. Mark Hughes to talk a little bit about mobile coverage in terms of the investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gary Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415786400,"counter":578,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a question regarding the focus of operators in terms of their investment and whether it was exclusively or predominantly on data.  The answer to that question is \"No\"; it is on both voice and data.  As for coverage, as my industry colleague, Ms Mairead Cullen, explained, a number of factors influence this.  Two issues additional to those she outlined which also influence coverage are the increased use of data - which of its nature puts pressure on voice calls - and the increased penetration of smartphones, of which everyone is aware.  Smartphones are complex devices that raise issues from a network perspective that must be managed.  As Ms Mairead Cullen outlined, from a network perspective we monitor the network on an hourly and daily basis, looking at usage and seeking to optimise the services that customers receive from the perspectives of both voice and data.  The focus really is on ensuring there is coverage where there is usage - namely, in the home, in work premises and while people travel.<\/p><p>  In respect of the investment, from the perspective of mobile telephony, investment is ongoing with regard to upgrading to both 3G and 4G.  That investment has begun and in the case of all the operators represented here today, there have been upgrades to 3G and 4G in most, if not all, of the counties.  However, as Mr. Pat Galvin has outlined, that process will take time.  Nevertheless, one would expect that to be completed over the next two to three years, as it has begun and is being rolled out.  This investment is not simply an urban investment but also a rural investment.  Consequently, as Mr. Galvin outlined with regard to 4G, for example, it will be rolled out in rural areas and in respect of the national broadband scheme, NBS, areas.  As part of this, however, as Mr. Denihan outlined, there are issues that affect the optimal level of service that customers can use - for example, where a site is located and whether we can get access to roads.  To the extent that we can work together with the Government, local authorities and members present today to overcome those issues, ultimately, together with our investment, we should see an improvement in both voice coverage and data usage from a customer perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1415786400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a point made by Mr. Denihan regarding the use of the ducting along NRA roads.

That is the ideal time to engage.  At the previous meeting, committee members referred to coverage issues on motorways.  That is because we only had access to the motorways when they were open and not at the time they were built and designed, which is the ideal.  We now have engagement with the NRA and we are working on it, but the delay is unfortunate and means people have coverage difficulties on the motorways.  We built our network without those motorways in mind.  We built it around towns, and when the motorway comes in and people are using it we must redesign our network.  Ideally, we redesign it along the network.  Greater co-ordination with State agencies helps, particularly in respect of motorways.

There are two reasons for this.  First, it makes commercial sense for companies such as eircom and other platform owners represented today to have as much traffic on their networks as possible.  We talked about making a profit and having a return.  Clearly, the more traffic there is on the network, the better.  That is the commercial motivation for eircom.  Notwithstanding this, as eircom is a rigorously regulated company, the investment is subject to very clear regulations that oblige us to allow full access to the network at wholesale and network levels to other operators which then resell at the retail end.  The fibre investment we have made stimulates competition at the retail end.  That is a fundamental principle of eircom's business plan, notwithstanding the fact that the regulatory obligation obtains.<\/p><p> These are not easy issues because regulation has an impact on pricing, roll-out plans and the speed of development.  These are complex issues on which we have many discussions with ComReg.  In essence, the more we invest in fibre as a platform owner, the more benefits that will accrue everywhere, including in communities of 800 or 900 people that would never have anticipated receiving services such as this, not only from eircom but also from other retail operators represented here that use our network.<\/p><p> Let me consider the wider issue of sharing.  As Dr. Healy said, it makes technological sense not to duplicate in the mobile area when we can have sharing agreements.  That makes eminent commercial sense for the industry.

There have been a number of developments in recent years with regard to commercial models that have facilitated sharing.  In parallel, the technology has been evolving and this has enabled the solutions to become available to us to allow us to share in ways that were not previously possible.  We are certainly considering more innovative solutions in this regard involving the operators.  We are working with the authorities and various bodies that make assets available to us such as the NRA which has been mentioned, the RPA, NAMA and the OPW to ensure the industry is taking advantage of the infrastructure available to it for sharing.<\/p><p>  On the question about the database and information available to customers and Deputies on network coverage, the relevant information is freely available.  We all publish coverage maps for the various technologies, including 2G, 3G and 4G.  We provide coverage data for data and voice services which are available through multiple channels.  They are available on our Internet sites, the retail channels and at our care desks if customers ring us.  The information we obtain from customers on coverage and problems they are having comprises the key input we use for the ongoing planning of the network.<\/p><p>  Let me reiterate some of the points Mr. Galvin made about fibre and the rolling out of additional fibre and consider the question of whether it changes fundamentally the rules of the game.  Vodafone and other partners have complemented what eircom has been doing with fibre in terms of other initiatives.  Again, this is reflective of a very competitive marketplace.  Vodafone has recently announced a joint venture with the ESB that will bring fibre to over 50 towns, the names of which have been announced.

There were black spots until the mid-1970s, although the rural electrification scheme had commenced in 1949, which was before I was born but I read about it.  The delegates talked about areas in which the service was not commercially viable.  It was the same in the case of electrification.  The ESB supplied the major towns which, in some cases, had their own electricity plants.  However, the black spots were left until last.  I come from a rural area, the Cooley Peninsula, which was one of the first areas to be electrified in the country.  It was second to Julianstown, County Meath.  People waited and waited and eventually, after 25 years, the project was completed.  Do the delegates envisage the realisation of their vision for the entire country will take 25 to 30 years?  I am particularly concerned about small and medium-sized industries.  I am glad to say that on my peninsula there are thousands of people working in small and medium-sized industries, but they do not have the proper or adequate coverage they require to conduct business.<\/p><p>  What areas are receiving top priority in the rolling out of broadband?

I cannot understand the position on coverage.  I believe it may be the case that on most motorways there is inadequate mobile phone coverage.  There is nothing more annoying than having to tell a caller to call back in ten or 15 minutes because one is entering an area with no coverage.  One does not like having to tell a caller with a grievance in the first instance that one will have to call him or her back in 15 minutes.

We talk about frustration but, to put it really mildly, people where I live are more than frustrated.  They are ready to move out of the area.<\/p><p>  We talk about the rural and the urban divide with regard the delivery of fibre optic cable.  I live in an urban area where there is a population of more than 125,000 people.

The golf course on the other side has full fibre optic.  In these 20 homes, we have people from highly qualified, professional backgrounds who might like to work from their homes, but they cannot.  The best speed ever that we have received there, according to my chart, is 0.79 Mb per second and perhaps an upload of 0.1 Mb per second.  I have made representations to Eircom, UPC, and Sky, who are selling their services, and they say it is not commercially viable.  Why is it commercially viable 150 m away and it is not commercially viable on this street?  The response I am getting back is that the cabinet for this particular street is too far away and therefore they are not going to do it.  I have asked this question a number of times and I still am not getting the answer to it.  Who is responsible for the upgrade?  Why can we not use for fibre optic the ducting that is used for the copper wiring that is feeding the telephone lines system?  Can somebody present please give me answers to whether it will it be done and, perhaps, if it will ever be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200009#J00100","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1415788200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I welcome the industry representatives and the individual companies involved and I wish to recognise that the companies are competitors as well in providing this service.  As part of the presentation, there was reference to the investment the companies have made over recent years in upgrading the networks, both for broadband and mobile phone coverage.  That investment is paid for by subscriptions from Irish households.  If anybody did an exercise on the amount of money spent by each household on their fixed line, mobile, television subscription and broadband services, I would submit that, if graphed, it would come to a sizeable proportion of household expenditure in 2014.  That has to be recognised.<\/p><p>  The increased investment has brought about a huge transformation in terms of speeds and services in many areas, particularly the commercially viable areas, which are chiefly urban areas.  That has led to a huge change in public expectation, especially those members of the public who are looking enviously at their neighbours because they can get speeds and services up to 100 Mb while, across the road, people could be on dial-up.  That is the environment in which the companies are working as providers and we are working as representatives.  It is a very difficult gap to bridge.  In some respects, the industry is a victim of its own success and technology.  However, it is causing problems.<\/p><p>  I live on the Beara Peninsula in west Cork.  It is probably one of the most challenging areas in terms of the provision of any service in the country because of its location.  It is a spectacularly beautiful location - I would say that - but that leads to difficulties in the provision of telecommunications services or any other service.  It is on areas like where I live that the national broadband plan, under its terms, should be focused.<\/p><p>  In addressing that problem, I have a question for the industry representatives, and perhaps ComReg has the information.  I see every day different graphs and statistics showing where Ireland stands in terms of broadband speed and penetration per household.  There can be five, even 20, different stories, depending on the way the graph is interpreted.  Anything less than 5 Mb is not on anymore, in terms of provision of a service.  I note the Government has said a minimum of 30 Mb is going to be the standard for the new broadband plan.  In 2014, however, if a person has anything less than 5 Mb, he or she is not at the races.  Does the industry have an overall percentage, status or gauge as of the beginning of 2014 of the number of households in this country that do not get a consistent 5 Mb speed?  We do not want to hear that it is, for example, 70% of households, as 70% of households could be made up between Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  What is the number of households?  I am saying this in the context of companies tendering and looking at getting taxpayers' money to deliver 30 Mb or better in terms of services to those households that are currently on dial-up.  Does the industry know exactly where in this country the service levels are critical?  There are areas in my constituency that are still on dial-up.  It is hugely frustrating.<\/p><p>  A classic case would be a presentation we listened to a month ago or more.  There was pride in the announcement that 200 km of fibre was planned for County Cork.  That is one line from Youghal to the western end.  That is a very one dimensional delivery in terms of fibre.  That is the scale.  I would like to know how the delivery of fibre to every household is going to be achieved.  There is talk about fibre to seven inhabited offshore islands.  How is that going to be achieved?  Is there a timescale for that?  Has the industry looked at how it is going to engage with the national broadband plan in delivering those?  How much taxpayers' money is it expected will be spent subsidising the companies to deliver fibre to each house?  When will this happen?  I expect the industry will say the sooner the better.  However, people are trying to make decisions about living or continuing to live in an area because they cannot access online services for day-to-day business, even Government business.  If a person is trying to set up a business or an SME in those areas where Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have no interest or cannot attract any investment, they are desperately looking at this broadband plan as a potential to begin to or to continue to live there.<\/p> <p> I wish to turn now to mobile phone coverage.  As Senator Eamonn Coghlan stated, three people living the same house who use three different mobile phone operators will obtain different levels of service.  I can inform our guests of where my line drops out and the locations in which I have never been able to pick up a signal.  Friends who live nearby have told me that they receive good signals.  Are our guests in a position to outline the true position with regard to the level of mobile phone coverage offered by the various service providers in this country?  If they were able to do so, it would provide a true indication of whether coverage is improving, deteriorating or remaining the same.  Individual operators have different priorities and what we want to discover is the true picture with regard to coverage.  As the Chairman stated, all we have available to us is anecdotal evidence.  We need an idea of how the industry measures mobile phone penetration and coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200009#J00200","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415788800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The part of our guests presentation which relates to challenges refers to any inconsistency of approach on the part of local authorities.  Will they provide an example of such inconsistency?  Are there any local authorities which are more culpable than others in this regard?  Does this inconsistency of approach come down to policy or does it relate to the infrastructural requirements in respect of the roll-out of mobile or broadband services?  It was stated that there is an issue with regard to State agencies access to State properties.  Does this relate to locations in which masts have been erected?<\/p><p>  When Eircell and Esat Digifone commenced operations in the 1990s, as Deputy Harrington pointed out, there were areas of west Cork in which it was not possible to obtain mobile phone coverage.  The latter is still the case in these areas.  On the regional routes between Dunmanway and Macroom and Dunmanway and Clonakilty, there are several areas in which it is not possible to obtain a mobile phone signal.  This is exceptionally frustrating for people.<\/p><p>  There is a major issue with mobile, broadband and satellite coverage in an area near Bantry comprising the Borlin and Coomhola valleys.  The hill farmers in this area need to access the Internet in order to download area aid forms, etc., but there is no coverage.  In order to conduct any business on the Internet they must either travel into Bantry to an Internet cafe or use whatever limited service is available to them at home late at night when the level of demand is not great.  The national broadband map which is due to be put up on the Department's website later this month will not be much good to anyone living in the Borlin and Coomhola valleys because they will still not be able to access the Internet.  I understand the commercial interests of the organisations involved in providing services.  Their objective is to make money rather than provide charitable services.  However, there is going to be a shortfall in the context of the level of service they are prepared to provide and the Government will then be obliged to pick up the slack.  Will our guests indicate the timeframes in respect of this matter?  Will those timeframes be realistic?<\/p><p>  In the context of its report, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which is chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane, put forward a number of quite specific recommendations in respect of broadband provision.  Have our guests' companies and organisations worked these recommendations into their mission statements at every level and not just that which relates to their commercial interests?

Senator Brennan and Deputy Harrington referred to broadband.  The Government's scheme will produce a mapping exercise which will show areas which are currently not in receipt of broadband and those which are in receipt of it.  That plan will offer solutions in respect of the areas identified by Senator Eamonn Coghlan - to which one can walk from here - and parts of the Coomhola Valley in Cork.<\/p><p>  In the context of the pace at which everything will proceed, there are obviously hurdles in Brussels which must be traversed.  An issue will also arise in the context of the Government's tendering process, namely, when this will be actioned and so on.  The industry is extremely keen to engage with the process because, in the first instance, such tenders are a source of business for those in the industry.  Once those households and SMEs currently unable to access broadband are in a position to do so, it will generate more revenue for the industry.  There is a great willingness to engage.  The position with regard to timeframes and localities will hinge on the outcome of the mapping exercise and the approach taken by the Government.<\/p><p>  Senator Brennan referred to motorways.  As I stated earlier in reply to a question from Deputy McEntee, there is a range of historical issues relating to motorway coverage.  The key matter for us is to get our infrastructure in place along motorways.  We have a number of innovative solutions in mind and we are beginning to get engagement from the National Roads Authority in respect of this matter.  We believe we have some of the answers so if we can get the authority to engage with us and move forward on that matter, then we anticipate some positive developments.<\/p><p>  Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to a number of technical issues in respect of definitions and timing.

We fully understand the concerns of all Members of the Oireachtas in respect of this matter.  We are also concerned about it.  The overall percentages in respect of households which either have or do not have access to high-speed broadband will be revealed - down to the level of individual building or premises - by the mapping exercise.  On the basis of what the Department stated last month, we understand the information will be published in a number of weeks.  I presume it will be forthcoming by year end.  The industry does not have one map in the context of mobile coverage.  However, there is almost near universal availability of basic mobile services.  Ms Cullen and Mr. Hughes may wish to comment on this matter.<\/p><p>  Deputy McCarthy referred to the inconsistency of approach among local authorities.  A number of issues arise in this regard.  I will provide a simple example.  If an operator needs to run a cable from one location to another and if this involves moving between different local authority areas, different permits may be required.  Sometimes the technical information local authorities require from operators will also differ.  In response to requests from within the industry, a move to a national licensing system for road openings is in the pipeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200010#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Torlach Denihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1415788800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but would Mr. Denihan be in a position to provide other examples of the inconsistency on the part of local authorities - particularly that in my area - in terms of their approach?

I assure Senator Brennan regarding the roll-out of high-speed broadband in rural Ireland, including the Cooley Peninsula.  We have circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas a reference to an Eircom website where their constituency offices can go right down to individual community level and see exactly where Eircom intends to enable cabinets for high-speed broadband.  We have clear plans and programmes on where and when we intend to invest.  The issue today is what happens where we do not intend to invest, and we have rehearsed the point well.<\/p><p>  Senator Eamonn Coghlan and Deputy Harrington raised individual areas.  I am familiar with Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s case and it illustrates a point I made earlier that we are involved in a three year programme.  We brought fibre where we could quickly, and the Senator referred to the estate close to his home.  Like many other developments, this one has particular physical constraints.  Technology has physical constraints, and this is one of the complexities.  Service depends on how far one is from the cabinet and whether it is commercially viable to extend the network.  We are examining this in the Senator's community.  The second phase of the programme examines where we are and asks if we can go further.  It is a very calculated, clear programme of investment where we review what we have done, bearing in mind the costs emerging and the technological improvements we are making.<\/p><p>  As I am also from west Cork, I am familiar with Deputy Harrington&rsquo;s location and places such as Ballylickey, Coomhola and Kealkill.  One of the issues there is where a house has two serving exchanges but is distant from both.  Again, it is a case of getting technical experts to see what can be done.  However, we must be realistic.  We still depend ultimately on some type of Government intervention to pick up areas such as the hill farmers the Deputy mentioned.  When we put in a phone line, we are regulated not to recover the full cost of it, unlike other utilities which can get a significant contribution from the householder.  We have a universal service and can recover only a certain amount of our costs and it takes a long time to do so.  When we look at challenging geographical areas and the investment case, we must be realistic about what we can achieve in order to make a profit on it and continue to invest.<\/p><p>  Universality has traditionally been a feature of the telecommunications industry, where a company was obliged to deliver a universal service.  It is a very interesting point because in discussions we have with Government and the European Commission regulators, our view generally is that broadband should be considered to be an issue of universal availability.  If the national broadband plan is implemented in the manner proposed, it will become a de facto universal service obligation and whoever wins will be obliged perhaps up to 30 Mbps, or whatever the speed is, in the catchment area of the tender.  What could emerge from all this discussion is a universal broadband service funded by the taxpayer, and not in terms of any wasteful expenditure because state aid rules are very clearly designed to ensure money is spent as efficiently as possible.  We have covered many areas that are part of the ongoing discussion the industry is having with the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200011#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Galvin"},{"type":"speech","time":1415789400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Could we have an example of access to State properties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200011#L00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415789400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>The most prominent one is the National Roads Authority with the Office of Public Works, and there are others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Torlach Denihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415789400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Each local authority has different rules around levies and bonds, and while some local authorities are approachable in terms of giving us access to sites for masts, others are less approachable.

As an industry we have spoken to Kerry County Council and the prohibition is under review.  We would like it to be removed because if affects how we roll out our networks.  Sometimes, we cannot get the optimal site due to local authorities' restrictions.  We have had challenges as an industry in dealing with the OPW in terms of finding and maintaining sites.  We are willing to engage with all State agencies, including the NRA and OPW.<\/p><p>  We have found that engagement with local authorities and State agencies has been more challenging than we would have liked.  This has caused difficulties, for example when a State agency has a property that might solve a blackspot problem but will not give us access to it.  There might be local protests because people do not want a site nearby or there might be a conservation area, and we must take this into consideration.  Sometimes blackspots are caused by physical factors, in that a particular geographical location is very difficult for reception and coverage, but sometimes we cannot get the site we want.  A more consistent framework for State agencies and local authorities would help us to identify this.

A commitment to this would be fantastic.  Looking at taxpayer-funded investment, where the industry might step in and upgrade a 15 Mbps service to 30 Mbps, it is borderline commercially viable.  Providers might prefer to get State investment to get such a community up to 30 Mbps instead of going out to a place that is clearly not commercially viable and will take significant State investment, where people are on anything from dial-up to 3 Mbps.

While all of us represent the industry, our companies also compete.  Network differentiation is one of the key aspects on which we compete and it is one that we signal to our customers.  For this reason, customers will experience differences because the companies provide services in different locations.  While all the companies are all rolling out new and innovative technology, how this is done and at what specific locations it is done may differ.  We are being continuously pushed by our customers to extend both our reach and our new technologies.  Customers will, therefore, experience differences.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about certain areas that are still not served by broadband.  We have outlined the barriers that have faced us for many years as we seek to address some areas.  I assure members that technology is evolving, particularly on the mobile side, and one of the new innovative technologies available to us is to reuse spectrum that was previously used on 2G and re-purpose it on 3G technologies.  The laws of physics dictate that one achieves a much greater reach than previously when one uses this lower band spectrum.  It is possible to do this from existing sites and while we face barriers, technology is also helping us to evolve from our existing sites.  As this technology rolls out, coverage will be extended to areas that have not been served without new sites being added to the network. <\/p><p>  A highly technical question was asked on down-link and up-link speeds and ping times.  On typical applications such as the speed tests that are available on mobile devices, the down-link and up-link speeds represent the throughput rate one is able to receive.  What this means in terms of packages is that video use requires a higher throughput speed to enable the data to go up and down.  A higher upload speed is required to facilitate, for example, the uploading of photographs to a Facebook site.  The ping measure represents the latency on the network, in other words, how responsive the network is to packets of data going from one destination and coming back.  Typically, we seek to improve this measure because it needs to be highly responsive for interactive types of services such as gaming services.  The effect of these metrics on a customer's experience will depend on the service he or she is using.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200012#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1415790000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>What would be a good ping number?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111200012#M00200","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415790000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>It depends on the technology and application being used.
