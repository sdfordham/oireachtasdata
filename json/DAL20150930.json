These contributions provide cover for long-term social insurance benefits including the State pension (contributory) and the  widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.  In contrast, a combined employer and employee PRSI rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of most employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent actuarial review of the social insurance fund published in 2012 found that, in the case of the self-employed with earnings equivalent to national average earnings, a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory) to the self-employed.  This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed. The review also showed that the self-employed at all income levels got better value for money for their contributions in regard to the State pension than employees generally. <\/p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the advisory group on tax and social welfare found that almost nine out of every ten self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Therefore, it was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p>  <p>  However, the group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only. <\/p>  <p>  While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlement for people who are self-employed - there are many such people and the number is growing - any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000003#A00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1443601800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I do not detect from the Minister's response any developments since this matter was raised five months ago.

I admit the report stated that should be done on a compulsory basis but there is no rationale to that because countries such as Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, Lithuania, even Romania, are doing this, either for unemployment benefits or sickness benefits on a voluntary basis, such as we have proposed.

Through very careful management we have actually reduced that deficit or, as some people in the media used to call it, the hole in the social insurance fund, to about &euro;180 million, compared to the &euro;2 billion plus left to us by the previous Government.  If the Deputy is talking about expanding social insurance then he should be aware that first, it has to be funded and second, it has to be funded in a way that is appropriate for the people who are interested.  The Deputy's first point was whether it could be made voluntary.  I do not think there is any example anywhere of a voluntary social insurance scheme because the people more at risk would pay and the people who appear not to be at risk, much younger people, might choose not to pay at all.  It would cause an enormous problem, even for contributory old age pensions that self-employed people receive for a 4% contribution.  Let me be clear about this, I am all in favour of extending it but it will have to be contributed to.  I do not know what is Fianna F&aacute;il's attitude on this issue.

The official indicator of poverty is consistent poverty, which is the overlap of two measures, namely, at risk of poverty and basic deprivation.  The basic deprivation indicator includes two items relating to the consumption of food.  According to the CSO survey of income and living conditions of 2013, which contains the most recent statistics we have on this, 4% of the population were unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day and 8% were unable to afford a roast in addition once a week.  Food-related items are, therefore, a very small component of the basic deprivation index.  These statistics are available in full and listed in the survey of income and living conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides income support to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty.  In 2013 social transfers, excluding pensions, lifted almost one quarter of the population out of being at risk of poverty.  Ireland is among the best performing states.  We come in slightly behind countries such as Denmark and Sweden.  The OECD report of 15 September shows Ireland just after the Scandinavian countries in terms of performance.  Our recovery is noted for the level of protection we have had for people on social welfare incomes and this can be seen in the OECD report.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has a number of programmes to improve access to food for vulnerable people.  The school meals programme will spend &euro;39 million this year, which is an increase of &euro;2 million on the last budget.  It provides breakfasts and lunches to 1,700 schools and organisations in respect of approximately 220,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  The Department administers the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, FEAD, which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk.  Almost &euro;27 million will be available over the period to 2020, of which 65% is for food.  The Department advertised this programme in July and the applications process is ongoing.  It is progressing very well and is being used by many organisations which provide meals to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000005#C00600","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The response is just not good enough.  The T&aacute;naiste stated 220,000 children receive breakfasts and lunches.  This is a welcome development for these children, but why is it happening?  It is because people do not have enough money.  They do not earn enough in their wages.  It also affects pensioners.  The minimum wage should be increased.  People who lost their jobs are still unemployed.  The only way to deal with this is to increase people's incomes in order that they might to be able to buy food or else the Government should subsidise food for people on certain incomes, such as a 10% or 20% discount on certain foods which are necessary.  This could be pinpointed by organisations dealing with food poverty.<\/p>  <p>  It was ironic that the T&aacute;naiste spoke about a recovery several weeks ago and then went with a big smile on her face to cut a ribbon to open a food bank in Glasnevin.

Ireland has a level of inequality that is below the average in the European Union and the 28 OECD countries, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom.  In other words, we have less inequality in Ireland, notwithstanding the biggest economic crash in our history, than the average of European Union and OECD countries.  It is far below that of the United States.  According to EUROSTAT, the Gini coefficient was 30 in Ireland in 2013, compared with a European average of 30.5.  This is a reflection of both our highly progressive tax system and the strength and depth of Ireland&rsquo;s social protection system.<\/p>  <p>  Relative poverty is measured through the at-risk-of-poverty indicator.  EUROSTAT data indicates that Ireland&rsquo;s at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2013, the last figures we have from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, and which was based on data from the height of the crisis in 2012, was 14.1%,.  That is better than the EU average, where the proportion at risk of poverty is 16.6%.  Ireland has the seventh lowest at-risk-of-poverty rate of the 28 EU member states.  A key reason for Ireland&rsquo;s low at-risk-of-poverty rate is social transfers.  In 2013, social transfers, excluding pensions, lifted almost a quarter of the population out of relative income poverty.  Ireland is the best-performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, and this reflects the Government decision not to reduce core welfare rates as part of the troika programme.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, I believe that growing employment and supporting people back to work will have the greatest impact on poverty.  The Government&rsquo;s twin employment strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work are reaping rewards as Ireland&rsquo;s recovery continues to strengthen, with more than 110,000 additional people returning to work and unemployment falling by a third.  We have much to do in this area but we are just behind the likes of Austria, Sweden and Denmark.  That we have the seventh lowest level of inequality in the EU is a very important achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000006#D00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I did not ask the Minister about inequality or whether we were 0.5% percent above the OECD average.

The Deputy did not reference it in her question.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, an employer company shall be regarded as being insolvent if the company is placed into receivership, if a winding-up order has been made or if a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the company has been passed.  The Department is continuing to review the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and owe moneys to their employees.  The Department is consulting a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of these issues.  Officials from the Department will continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter.  Given the very difficult legal issues that need to be addressed, I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review will be completed.  We do not yet have a legal solution to it because there are all sorts of consequences that might flow from taking a legal position that was not carefully worked out.

If that is the position, why are sole traders not obliged to do so when they set up companies, rather than it being a case of finding out after the fact that a sole trader does not have insurance and of workers being left high and dry?  Workers must deal with the insolvency payments scheme, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, etc., and they are getting nowhere.  Their PRSI payments were not made and right across the board they are not entitled to medical care.

I will outline some of the difficulties.  We have reformed the insolvency payments scheme.  People are now paid their entitlements very rapidly.  It has been transformed since the payments were taken over by the Department of Social Protection.  However, the law is, in general, not in the remit of my Department but in that of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  A more appropriate approach might be to widen the remit of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement so that proceedings can be taken.  However, in the case of a very small firm - and I do not know what is involved in the cases to which the Deputy refers -  the sums of money involved may be very small.

The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland as part of the social welfare system was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit on arrival in Ireland.  In many cases, such a person would not be entitled to export it.  While I understand the Deputy has a particular set of circumstances in mind regarding Irish people who have been living and working in Ireland, we live in an EU which has habitual residence conditions.  Given that our pension payments, notwithstanding the earlier discussion, are among the highest in the EU, the Deputy would be opening us to a huge number of people coming from other EU countries to claim non-contributory pensions.

In fact, as the Deputy knows, they would have had no change in their income from the lone parent's allowance.  However, once a parent's youngest child is seven years old, he or she can become involved in education and training opportunities.  That is going extremely well in the Department and has been very well received.  Some 2,500 lone parents moved to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme because, presumably, their youngest child was over 14 years of age.  Some 8,100 lone parents moved to the family income supplement scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A significant number of lone parents would be full-time homemakers and that has always been the case.

In Britain and the North of Ireland, that occurs at five years of age.  At that stage, one gives people an opportunity to get involved again in education, training and work.

This increase is, by default, paid directly to the qualified adult.   <\/p> <p> Supplementary welfare allowance is a means-tested payment.

The point that was being made was that potentially there were certain anomalies in the system.  While welcoming the homemaker's scheme, which the Minister introduced in 1994, she made the point that it excluded people like herself who had to give up their jobs prior to 1973 and that there was an anomaly in the scheme relating to the way PRSI contributions were worked out.  I believe that the requirements to get a full contributory pension are that one must have accumulated 500 full PRSI contributions and have worked ten years before reaching the age of 55.  This person claims that she meets both of those criteria but that the Department averaged the contributions over a 47-year period which meant that had she never worked prior to her marriage and only worked post-1998, which she did, she would get the full whack but because she worked prior to her marriage, she is being discriminated against.

If the lady has a spouse, she could look to get a qualified adult payment.  Again, this is not as high as a full non-contributory weekly pension in her own right.

It is the Upper House and the Chamber which applies checks and balances to what happens in this House.  It gives a second view.

The reason we do not get the chance to scrutinise the detail is that if we did get the chance to do so, the whole thing would unravel and we would discover that nothing was really happening.  It is all generalities and any measures are simply rehashed and recycled versions of measures that have been announced previously while nothing is happening on the ground.  In fact, in many cases, the situation is getting much worse on the ground, as is certainly the case with the housing crisis.<\/p><p>It should not be allowed happen with the housing crisis, which is a disaster, but let us not compound that sort of bad politics by doing the same on an issue as important and as vital to the survival of humanity and this planet as climate change.<\/p> <p> I do not see why the Minister would resist these amendments and I do not see what is at stake other than a desire by the Government to continue closed and unaccountable government that operates by diktat and spin.

Important plans should be subject to such scrutiny and it would send a clear message that the Government is serious about the issue of climate change and so serious that it intends to hard-wire regular scrutiny of the matter into the political system in order that it cannot be spun, ignored or manipulated by this or that Government now or in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000013#L00900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443607800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I refer to my amendment No. 56.

When I was elected by the people of Laois-Offaly, that is what they sent me here to do.  Opposition Members need to have an input into these plans.  The Minister is keeping the Opposition outside the tent unnecessarily on this issue; he is pushing the Opposition outside the door.  He can shake his head all he likes but that is what he is doing.  He has an opportunity, particularly through amendment No. 52,  to allow that to happen.  He has nothing to fear and everything to gain from laying the plan before the D&aacute;il and allowing a debate for a few hours on it.

Long evenings and nights have been spent on obscure issues that, perhaps, were not that important.<\/p>  <p>  A national mitigation plan is hugely important.  The issue of climate change will be a matter for life and death; it will be a matter of survival for some coastal areas.  We have witnessed the effects of rising sea levels along the west coast.  We also witnessed the negative effects of climate change on agriculture in recent years, following extreme weather patterns, which were damaging.

I am surprised he is shaking his head because the language the Government parties used when they were elected about democratic revolution was used precisely because they knew that the slaughtering the previous Government received at the polls was at least in part due to enormous disaffection and alienation from the political system and the political establishment, which continues to exist.  The Government parties felt the need to use that language because they knew that is what the people wanted.  They want more accountability, a more participatory democracy and more oversight of what governments do regarding the decisions that affect them.  A democracy which is just about an election every five years with the Government going off to do what the hell it likes in the interim is discredited.  It needs to change and this was acknowledged in the programme for Government, but like so many other proposals, the Government parties are busily abandoning it.<\/p><p>In this case, it is abandoning it on an issue that is of vital importance for the survival of the planet, namely, that of climate change.  All that is being asked in these amendments is that the effectiveness of the national mitigation plan to do with reducing CO2 emissions, and the measures that will be taken to do that, would be scrutinised by the Houses of the Oireachtas and not simply spun by the Government of the day in whatever way it feels like so doing.  That is extremely important because, as I said, many of these announcements and plans are being made about crucial issues such as housing and capital investment.  We get the public relations, the press release and the photo opportunity but we do not get an opportunity to scrutinise the detail.  However, that is the point of democracy.  That is the point of this House and it is what the people are demanding.  The Minister is flying in the face of the demands of the people of this country for real democratic, thoroughgoing reform.  He is reverting to type in terms of the way a discredited political establishment has done its business for far too long.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on this.  There is nothing at stake in accepting these amendments except reform of, and improvement in, democracy, which would require that the scrutiny of our efforts to deal with climate change would be hardwired into the political system.  That is what we are asking for. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000014#M00900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443608400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The Minister was very forthright and almost curt in his response.  I acknowledge that what is contained in the Bill will receive the scrutiny it deserves in the Seanad.  However, one of the main elements of it is the publication of a climate change plan.  It would have targets, proposals and responsibilities and much of what would be contained in it would have to be adhered to by various Departments.  The Seanad has the authority to agree or disagree with, and scrutinise and amend, many aspects of the Bill, including the general plan.  The Minister believes it is right and proper to discard that collective authority of the Seanad and the wisdom that may be contained within it.  If the Seanad is entitled to agree the parameters of the plan, by virtue of amending and eventually voting on this Bill, it is entitled, on a regular basis, to be appraised of it and of its success or failure in order for it to initiate amendments to the Bill into the future.  I do not believe it is at the behest, or within the remit, of the Minister to rid it of that authority because, as other speakers have said, the Seanad, as the second or the Upper House, has a role to play and that is provided for in the Constitution.

I think Deputies are forgetting the role of the advisory council in regard to this.  There is an annual transition statement as part of this process and that statement will be debated in the D&aacute;il with respect to mitigation and adaptation.  Every Member of the House will have the opportunity, through that process, to make his or her views on this issue known.  However, ultimately, the differentiation here, which I have made very clear on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage, is that the Government, quite rightly, should be held accountable and it should be the approving authority in this and in many other areas.  Therefore, there is a fundamental difference of opinion here.  It has nothing to do with a democratic deficit but has to do with the fact that the Government should be the approving authority on this issue.  We have the advisory council in place, which we will be discussing at a later point in this debate, and its role is quite important too.<\/p>  <p>  I made a number of commitments on Second and Committee Stages that I would consider various proposals, amendments and options that were put forward by Deputies.

Otherwise there is no incentive to design a plan that will bring about any kind of meaningful reductions.  Why were other amendments tabled by me and other Opposition Deputies that would incorporate and embody targets within the agreed timeframe not accepted?  When discussing the need for this Bill and in its report on what it should contain, the all-party committee was clear in stating that the State needs to have targeted reductions in line with the international agreements to which it has signed up.  The absence of such targets means the Bill lacks any real powers to ensure any meaningful steps are taken to address the issues involved in bringing about a reduction in CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions across the economy.<\/p><p>Will the Minister accept this amendment?  I deliberately put this amendment in at the start of this section to ensure the national mitigation plan would be put up in big lights and that there would be agreed targets on reductions in CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions right through to 2050.  We need to deal with this problem on an incremental basis, each year and every five years, right through to 2050.  Our children will be adults by then.  They may have children of their own.  Our grandchildren may be in communities and workplaces throughout the State and they will be the ones dealing with the catastrophe of a carbon cliff.  The State will also be burdened with the need to purchase carbon credits, which are not cheap.  Apart from the environmental damage, this will place a financial burden on the State.<\/p><p>I have heard people on the Government's side of the House criticising Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and Governments of other hues for short-termism in the past.  This is an opportunity to set out a plan for the next 30 years, which is a relatively short period of time.  Any one of us who remembers the past 34 years will realise they have gone quickly; perhaps more quickly than we would have liked.  I hope most of us will still be around in 34 years time, but we must do what we can during that time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We must have long-term plans and we need to move away from short-termism.  We have to move away from three, four, five and six-year cycles and look at things over periods of ten, 20 and 30 years.  Will the Government agree the targets in the national mitigation plan and set them out for the next 34 years?<\/p><p>We have already lost a lot of time on this matter.  I am not saying it is the fault of the Minister but time has been lost.  I first raised this issue in 2011, if memory serves me well, during my first year in this House.  Other Deputies have also raised it.  People who were here before us wanted this to be in place in 2008 and 2009.  We are playing catch-up.  We do not have the benefit of a springboard that will propel us half way towards those targets.  We have increased our greenhouse gas emissions and we are not and have not been doing enough to reduce them.  We cannot keep playing catch-up.  If there is further slippage over the next three, four or five years, we will reach a carbon cliff in six or seven years' time.  We will need to meet this challenge by reducing dramatically our greenhouse gas emissions at that point.  We will also have the cost, perhaps, of paying for carbon credits.<\/p><p>Will the Minister and his officials deal with this matter?  Will he accept the long-term approach Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing?  It is not a great vote catcher.

Their daughters spoke of how they thought their Daddy was going to die at the hands of these criminals.  The criminals wore balaclavas and had handguns and knives.  It was only due to Mrs. Corcoran ringing 999, as she was upstairs, that the garda&iacute; in Monasterevin were in a position to apprehend the gang.  There was also the case of John O'Donoghue in Doon, who collapsed and died when he came across intruders in his home.<\/p>  <p>  In the 12 months from June 2014 to June 2015, there were 28,830 burglaries in the country.  That is an average of approximately 80 reported burglaries per day.  It is a truly shocking figure.  Furthermore, that is not the real figure.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has admitted that many of these crimes go unreported.  Indeed, farmer David Thompson, aged 75, has been burgled three times in the past two years, but he has not reported the incidents.  He said there is no point as there is no Garda presence.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, has specifically linked the surge in crime to the human impact of the closure of a total of 139 Garda stations across the country, which saved only &euro;0.5 million.  Anybody who has a finger on the pulse of rural Ireland says that was the wrong decision.  Tim O'Leary, chairman of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, countryside division, said his organisation is deeply concerned and says it is happening because of the absence of garda&iacute; in localities.  When the nearest Garda station is 30 miles away one will not get a response.  John Comer of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, says rural people feel the neglect due to the lack of a Garda presence.<\/p>  <p>  There is real fear among people across the country, in both urban and rural areas.  Due to the lack of a Garda presence it is particularly acute in rural areas, and all of the organisations involved tell us this.  Will the Taoiseach accept that he got it wrong in terms of the closure of Garda stations across the country, that the strategy of removing presence in favour of mobility was wrong and that there are dire consequences as a result?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000018#Q00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1443609900,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Martin that these burglaries and attacks on ordinary people are deplorable, and I condemn them without reservation.  I am glad that many of those involved, although not all of them to date, will be brought before the courts under the law.  It is most unfortunate that a death occurred among the cases the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  We live in a very different type of society.  I and the Garda are aware that a small number of gangs are responsible for carrying out the majority of burglaries.  It also appears that many of those who carry out these burglaries and vandalism, including beating up elderly women and so forth, are high as a result of substance abuse and create fearsome damage.<\/p>  <p>  Garda stations were closed.  This is an operational matter for the Garda.  Having looked at the situation in so far as the closure of the Garda Training College in Templemore is concerned, where there were no garda&iacute; coming through, that college has now been re-opened and 500 new Garda recruits are going through the college on an ongoing basis and coming into active service.  There has been a change in the legislation for dealing with burglary which provides that consecutive sentencing can apply.  These are important matters.  A sum of &euro;27 million has been allocated to the Garda for vehicles over the last number of years.  In particular, finance has been made available for specialist vehicles to deal with high speed chases.<\/p>  <p>  The valid point the Garda can make is that there are an extra 61,000 community hours because garda&iacute; can now be in the community.  That is important in respect of communications, intelligence and information.  With regard to the capital programme announced yesterday, when the Government looked at the inferior, outdated and inadequate technological systems that the Garda has had to endure, it decided that must change and over &euro;200 million has been allocated for that.  One would like to think it could be done today, but obviously that is not possible.<\/p>  <p>  The observations and vigilance of communities are very strong.  The community text alert is a valuable instrument for notifying Garda stations and garda&iacute; of incidents, strangers or strange activity in a locality.  Obviously, the situation is not as satisfactory as we would wish.  In fairness, a number of the very old Garda stations that were in various communities, where garda&iacute; were expected to stay for a couple of hours once or twice a week to sign unemployment forms, would not prevent any crime.  However, Community Alert, community information, access, proper equipment, good vehicles and proper technology are essential for garda&iacute; to be able to their job.  That is where the Government's focus is.  I have been speaking to chief superintendents in their districts and they say the freeing up of garda&iacute; to do community work is an important aspect of the work they must do.<\/p>  <p>  I regret that these burglaries occur and I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner can put a specific plan in place to deal with the gangs that are carrying out burglaries on a nightly basis in various parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000018#Q00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1443609900,"counter":255,"content":"<p>That is a very weak response.

She works hard and her priority is putting her two kids through school and college.  In 2009 one of her dreams came true when she bought an affordable home in Longboat Quay here in Dublin.  Last night she learned to her horror that she may be evacuated from her home within a week.  Not just her and her two children, but all of the 299 families that live in Longboat Quay may have to move out.  Why is that?  The reason is that their homes are firetraps.  Built at the height of the boom by Bernard McNamara and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Longboat Quay has been plagued with problems for years.  Remedial work carried out to date has cost the docklands authority &euro;1.2 million.

There are nine families housed at that refuge right now.  Respond has been funding the facility itself for three years at &euro;350,000 per annum.  It has now run out of funds and has appealed to various Government Departments.  However, it has been informed that it will not obtain access to funding.  The families at the refuge, some of which left extreme circumstances of distress and domestic violence, will become homeless.  Under the provisions of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, I urge the Government to intervene.  Something should be done.

Some of this is accepted.  The &pound;7 million in an offshore account is accepted in terms of what happened there.  Deputy Wallace has raised other serious issues.  I have been raising this since July in terms of the establishment of a commission of investigation as a result of the fact that this matter involves taxpayers' money.

I suggest that the Criminal Assets Bureau requires legislative enhancement and the Taoiseach says he is going to do it.<\/p><p>That was four years ago, admittedly.  It is to be addressed in respect of two matters, the first of which concerns cross-jurisdictional issues in the North and Republic.  This would apply to Project Eagle should the Criminal Assets Bureau be involved in that scenario.  The second matter concerns paramilitary criminality in terms of fuel laundering and smuggling.  The National Crime Agency and MI5 are getting involved in this.

It is now a regular occurrence that the outcome of referendums is challenged in the courts.Our current legislation prescribes no specific time-frames within which such challenges should be heard and determined.  The Bill published today seeks to ensure that court challenges to the outcome of a referendum are fast-tracked through the court system whilst also ensuring that in the interests of justice, adequate time is provided to hear and determine any such challenges.<\/p><p>A challenge to a referendum result under our current law is a two-stage process.  First, a preliminary application is made to the High Court for leave to issue a petition challenging the result of a referendum and second, if leave is granted, the petition is then issued and, ultimately, a full trial or court hearing takes place.  Until the enactment of the Court of Appeal Act 2014, any appeal taken against a decision of the High Court in respect of the preliminary application for leave to petition fell to be heard by the Supreme Court.  By way of example, on 10 November 2012, a majority voted in favour of the children's rights amendment and that outcome was challenged.  It was not until almost two and a half years later, on 28 April 2015, that the children's rights amendment was finally incorporated into our Constitution, the Supreme Court having dismissed the referendum challenge four days earlier. <\/p><p>More recently, after the marriage equality referendum,  the High Court declined leave to petition to two persons challenging the validity of that referendum's outcome.  Each appealed, first to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court.  While the applications were ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court, they highlighted that a court challenge to the outcome of a referendum could result in court hearings in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  This would substantially extend the length of time taken for the courts to finally determine such challenges. <\/p><p>It is in the public interest that there is a proper and proportionate balance between the rights of the people who vote at a referendum and the rights of an individual or individuals to challenge a referendum's outcome.  It is also in the public interest that our courts facilitate applications taken to ensure the proper compliance with our laws in the holding of a referendum while also ensuring that the referendum outcome is not left in a legal limbo for an extended period of time.  This is the objective of this Bill.  <\/p><p>The Bill prescribes that all future appeals from decisions of the High Court in referendum matters go straight to the Supreme Court and that the Court of Appeal play no role in such court proceedings.  Where an application is made for leave to petition, it prescribes a three-day time frame within which an appeal can be filed in the Supreme Court against a decision of the High Court and that such appeal must be heard and determined within two weeks.  Where leave to petition is granted, it prescribes that the High Court trial or hearing must take place within six weeks and that judgement must be delivered no later than two weeks later.  A seven-day period is prescribed for the lodging of an appeal to the Supreme Court and such appeal must be heard within the following six weeks and judgement delivered no later than three weeks thereafter. <\/p><p>The Bill also addresses an additional difficulty highlighted by the Supreme Court in the recent proceedings relating to the marriage equality referendum.  The Supreme Court noted that despite the appeals pending before it, as no stay had been granted on the order of the Court of Appeal, the referendum certificate had already been signed and the marriage equality amendment had already been incorporated into the Constitution.  Had the Supreme Court disagreed with the decisions of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal and granted the applications to petition the High Court challenging the outcome of that referendum, an unprecedented constitutional difficulty could have arisen.  To resolve this difficulty, the Bill prescribes that a stay will automatically apply to any order made by the High Court for the days during which an appeal can be lodged with the Supreme Court or, where such appeal is lodged, until it is determined by the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes important changes to the Referendum Act 1994 and our Courts Acts. The time-frames prescribed by it are not set in stone.  It is my hope that the principle of the Bill will be accepted by both the Government and Opposition Deputies and that a constructive public debate can now take place on what is proposed. <\/p><p>The decision of the people in a referendum is an important democratic act of political sovereignty.  It is not tenable that, following the holding of a referendum in this State, for an extended period of time it can be uncertain as to whether or not a constitutional change favoured by a majority may become part of our fundamental laws, that court challenges to such outcomes can take two to three years and that individual citizens are denied the assistance or benefits that might affect their lives by agreed constitutional change coming into effect.  Moreover, should the courts determine that, as a result of an illegality, a mistake or other irregularity, the result of a referendum as a whole has been materially affected and that, as a consequence, the referendum result should be annulled and a new referendum held, it is in the public interest that the conduct of any such new referendum is not unduly delayed.<\/p><p>If this Bill was enacted, we would avoid all of the difficulties that have been experienced to date in this area, including such unnecessary delays occurring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000024#W03000","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443614100,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000025#X00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614100,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The Bill is not being opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000025#X00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443614100,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614100,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000025#X00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614100,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000025#X00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443614100,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443614100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 2.10 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1443614400,"counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000026#Y00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","time":1443614400,"counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000026#Y00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  The issue of dirt bikes has plagued not just my community but communities across the country.  People are now being seriously injured because of the reckless behaviour of some youths.  During the summer I was contacted by residents of Rossmore Park in Ballyfermot, who expressed grave concerns in respect of the use of dirt bikes by youths in the area in terms of the noise that is generated and, most importantly, the risk to public safety.<\/p>  <p>  I contacted the Garda locally to highlight the problem and Sergeant Gwen McKenna of the Ballyfermot Garda station provided a comprehensive response for which I am very grateful.  I commend the report which was well laid out and emphasised the problems the Garda is experiencing.  The report stated that the Garda is aware of the problems with dirt bikes locally but has real difficulty determining if a person is compliant with road traffic legislation.  A licence is required where the motorcycle engine capacity exceeds 49 cc.  However, a garda cannot determine the engine capacity without physically stopping the youths, which is nearly impossible in many cases.  A number of months ago in Ballyfermot a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was seriously assaulted when trying to seize dirt bikes.  This has become a serious issue in the area and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I understand the legal requirement to hold a licence only applies to public places as defined in the Road Traffic Act.  However, dirt bikes are mainly used on waste ground, in fields, and, in recent months, on walkways near the canal, which are not defined as public places and, therefore, the legislation does not apply.  The sad reality is that many youths on dirt bikes completely ignore the law and have no regard for local garda&iacute;, regardless of whether they are in a public place or anywhere else.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; cannot access places because the vehicles are made to drive over rough terrain, which makes it difficult for officers to follow them.  It makes their job twice as hard when they are pursuing three or four of them fleeing the scene at the same time.  Garda&iacute; have told me that some of the users are as young as eight and have no understanding of the rules of the road.  When garda&iacute; call to their parents, it can be quite difficult to get any response regarding their children's use of these dirt bikes.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; regularly visit local schools to explain the dangers of dirt bikes and to talk about road safety but, unfortunately, their advice often falls on deaf ears.  Each year we provide money for youth projects, community development, youth clubs, GAA clubs and football clubs, and yet many of the youths who are involved in riding dirt bikes do not attend any of these projects or are not interested in confining themselves to being involved in these clubs.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda is doing what it can but its hands are tied because of the limit of legislation governing dirt bikes.  That is why I am asking the Minister to consider amending the road traffic legislation to see what might be done to address the problem before somebody is seriously hurt.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I witnessed an incident near Blackhorse Bridge in Inchicore where two elderly people were walking home from getting their messages and were nearly knocked over by a youth on a dirt bike entering through the exit to their senior citizen complex.  This is a very serious issue and it needs to be addressed.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000026#Y00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Catherine Byrne for raising what I know is an important matter in her constituency.  My area of responsibility relates to the legislation concerning the use of motor vehicles in public places.  This includes the use of dirt bikes or scrambler bikes in public areas.  Enforcement of the relevant legislation, including addressing any illegal use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The use of vehicles is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation.  The Road Traffic Act definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; includes any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles, whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.  Based on the definition of a \"public place\" and a \"mechanically propelled vehicle\" in road traffic legislation, the Garda is satisfied that it has the necessary powers to deal with the misuse of such vehicles in public places.  These powers allow the Garda to stop such vehicles in a public place and demand production of a licence or learner permit.  In specific response to a point the Deputy made regarding whether the Garda has the legal ability to stop a vehicle, the view of my Department is that the current road traffic legislation gives it the power to stop such vehicles in a public place and request production of a permit or licence.  I accept that having the legal ability to stop a vehicle does not get around the practical difficulty of trying to stop a person who is riding illegally and dangerously in a public place.  The Deputy made the specific point on the law in the area and I wanted to confirm that to her.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy correctly pointed out that if the engine capacity of the motor bike is below 50 cc, the minimum age to hold a driving licence is 16 years.  If it is above 50 cc, then the minimum age is 17 years.  In addition, the Garda may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation.  Road traffic law makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, to drive carelessly or to drive dangerously.  The Garda has informed me that any of these charges could be brought, where appropriate, in circumstances of misuse.  In certain circumstances where the misuse of these vehicles involves criminal damage, a prosecution can also be brought under the Criminal Damage Act, if appropriate.  The Garda also has powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and the regulations made under that section, SI 460 of 2011.<\/p><p>It appears to me, but I am happy to clarify the matter further for Deputy Byrne, that the powers do exist to deal with the matter that she has raised.  I am not sure at this point if any further change to the law is required, although I would be happy to hear the Deputy's input in the matter.  Based on my Department's consideration of the matter and the engagement we have had with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the law in regard to licensing, ability to stop and if need be, to remove a vehicle, does appear to be in place, but I do accept there are challenging matters in terms of the enforcement of the law given the behaviour to which the Deputy referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000026#Y00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443615000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I understand that legislation exists, as was stated in the Garda report, but some of the areas in which dirt bikes are used do not come under the category of roads, streets or parks.  They include laneways leading up to people's houses and in the vicinity of senior citizens.  Another area where the bikes are used are rough walkways along canals used by people for fishing.  They are not designated pathways and that is where the difficulty lies.  Access to such areas can be difficult for Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vehicles and therefore the garda&iacute; cannot pursue those involved.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in my area in the number of young people who own such bikes and, unfortunately, the children who use them are getting younger.  I am concerned that a young person using such dirt bikes will be killed.  The bikes are now used by children as young as eight, ten and 12 years.  When a garda from Ballyfermot tried to stop some youths recently he was seriously injured.  That type of behaviour is part of the problem as well.<\/p>  <p>  I accept what the Minister said about his brief and that the issue also comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I intend to raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality also as serious incidents are occurring.  I fear that the matter will only be further highlighted in the event of a young person on a dirt bike being seriously injured or an elderly person being knocked down and seriously injured.

From my constituency work I am aware that frequently it can be difficult to define whether a laneway is private property or who owns it.  It is my understanding that based on the definition of a public place in the context of road traffic law, the issue raised by the Deputy would be addressed, given that a public place is defined as an area to which the public has access, as opposed to a more traditional definition of an area owned by the public.  The issue relates to access.  I will ask for clarification on the matter and I will provide the information to the Deputy, which she might wish to share with the local Garda or others in the community.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the point made by Deputy Byrne.  I can see in the part of the city I represent that there are more such vehicles around and that they present a considerable threat to people when used in an illegal manner.  While I am satisfied that the legislation governing the area is adequate, I am also aware that it is very difficult to enforce the law if someone is driving illegally on a vehicle in a public park in which children or families are present.

In reply to a Priority Question last April, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, told me that the Ancient East tourism proposition, which is built on an abundance of culture and heritage assets in the south east and midlands, would have a positive impact on overseas tourism in Waterford.  At the time the Minister of State highlighted places such as the historic round tower in Ardmore, Ghaeltacht na Rinne, and the unique mining story of the Copper Coast, which is a superb and wonderful geopark, as assets that could be promoted under the Ancient East initiative.  The Minister of State said that the Ancient East project could be a game-changer for Waterford.  They were his exact words to me in the D&aacute;il at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The question we are asking in Waterford now is why it is one of the only counties involved in the Ancient East initiative that has not received specific funding in the first phase of the initiative, which totals approximately &euro;1.8 million.  Many of us feel that this is a snub to the city and county, in particular to the many people who make their living in the Waterford city and county tourism sector.  Many of those people have been most patient after we were short-changed in the Wild Atlantic Way initiative.  We were told that we would be looked after under the Ancient East initiative.  In the debate on the Wild Atlantic Way, the Minister of State resorted to shouting and screaming like a hyena.  That was recorded on local radio in Waterford so the exclusion of Waterford from the Wild Atlantic Way initiative did not do the Government or the Minister of State any good.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that only the first phase of the investment has been made.  Could the Minister provide a commitment that submissions from Waterford will receive funding in the second phase?  Could he also indicate when the funding will be made available?  For instance, will the Metal Man project in Tramore be considered under the second phase?<\/p>  <p>  At the time, the Minister of State told me that the Wild Atlantic Way was born out of a need to address the dramatic decline in international visitors to Ireland, in particular in the west.  However, I pointed out that Bord F&aacute;ilte&rsquo;s figures show a drop in visitor numbers to the south-east region from 1.1 million in 2000 to fewer than 685,000 in 2010.  That was one of the most dramatic drops in any region in the State.  Accordingly, the Minister can understand why very many businesses and people in the tourism industry in Waterford are aghast that we were completely excluded from the Wild Atlantic Way and that funding was not made available to Waterford for the Ancient East initiative.  In addition, the funding might not even be made available until the second tranche, which might only be made available next year.  We do not know what Government will be in power then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000027#Z00400","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1443615000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I spent a day in Waterford just before the summer when I had an opportunity to meet many of the people involved in tourism in Deputy Halligan&rsquo;s county.  In fairness to the Deputy, although I was aware of it, I acknowledge that I heard from them about their dissatisfaction and annoyance at Waterford not being able to participate in the Wild Atlantic Way initiative.  Deputy Halligan is correct to say that the Ancient East is a new plan that is designed to make the most of all of the assets a county such as Waterford has to offer.  From tourism promotion work I have done with Tourism Ireland, I am certain there is a huge appetite for the development and launch of a heritage and arts-based tourism campaign that will attract a new kind of tourist to this country who is not currently coming in the numbers we need.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenge to which Deputy Halligan referred in his region.  From my recollection of the figures on the number of people who visit the Deputy's county, the share of the revenue of all the money that is generated in tourism in the country that goes to the county is considerably below what would be warranted by the number of visitors to the county.<\/p><p>One of the reasons for that is the low number of bed nights in the county and in adjoining counties as compared to other parts of the country.  The Wild Atlantic Way has sought to address that in one part of the country, while Ireland's Ancient East is seeking to address in another.<\/p> <p> On the specific point the Deputy made on access to capital, the Viking triangle in Waterford City, which I had the opportunity to visit, received &euro;10.5 million in capital funding alone from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This appears to be very well invested in the centre of the city and I was extremely impressed by what I saw.  In total, Waterford has now received just under &euro;13 million in capital investment from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Deputy's final point related to the consideration of applications from Waterford.  I have discussed this matter with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I learned that no application from the county was successful in gaining funding.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I do not play a role in evaluating individual applications but I assure him that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working with interests in the county to look at how applications can be strengthened so that they might be in a position to access funding in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000027#Z00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443615600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Am I to take it that the Minister cannot give a commitment that we will obtain money for Ireland's Ancient East in the next tranche of funding?  Some &euro;10 million in State funding was given to the Viking triangle, which lies on the Ancient East trail.  It is interesting that a couple of weeks later the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, suggested the capital would be invested in Youghal rather than Waterford, which was an astounding statement for him to make.  I think the Minister of State is out of touch with what is happening in Waterford at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, referred to tourism figures.  The objective of the Wild Atlantic Way was to carry out an assessment of where tourism figures were dropping and where initiatives could be put in place, with the necessary finance, to attract tourism.  Ultimately, it is about attracting tourism and one of the ways to do that is to boost tourism initiatives in the area, which means the provision of finance.  The visitor numbers, as the Minister will see, have dropped substantially from 1.1 million to fewer that 700,000 in a few years.  This is why it was of paramount importance for us to obtain funding for the Wild Atlantic Way.  That has not happened and now we are not going to receive any of the &euro;1.8 million, or at least we will not do so now, and the Minister cannot definitively indicate whether in the near future - namely, January, February or next week - we will receive it.  This will further undermine job prospects in Waterford, which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has acknowledged was one of the worst-hit areas in the past six years and where, a few weeks ago, he said there was a need to invest in tourism and to create jobs in the sector.

As the Minister of State will be aware, yesterday was World Heart Day and it was fitting that in Brussels the heart failure policy network launched a policy toolkit to tackle heart failure.  The aim of the heart failure policy network is to create a lasting network of politicians working with other stakeholders to lead significant policy changes to improve the lives of people with heart failure in Europe.  Ireland has two representatives on the network, myself and Niall Johnson, the chief executive of Cro&iacute;, the west of Ireland cardiac foundation, an organisation which undertakes excellent work in the region.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will already know that heart failure is a chronic condition that often requires inpatient hospital treatment.  It occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's need for oxygen and important nutrients.  The condition affects at least 15 million adults across Europe and one in five people is at risk of developing the condition.  In Ireland, over 90,000 individuals live with the condition, which is responsible for between 600 and 700 deaths annually.  Most important is the increasing prevalence of the condition, with thousands of new diagnoses each year.  In fact, heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalisation among those over 65 throughout Europe and accounts for 5% of all acute hospital admissions.  Unsurprisingly, this is a condition which has a huge negative impact on people's lives and on quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  For too long heart failure has been the forgotten condition in health policies, despite the economic impact on health care and the terrible burden caused by people with the condition.  However, we can change this and the policy toolkit provides ten priority actions backed up by clinical evidence and the views and experiences of patients and it sets out the economic case for change.  We need to make heart failure a national health priority.  We can do this by establishing a national strategy, increasing public and clinician awareness of the condition and investing in reliable data to support policy decisions.  We also need to ensure timely diagnosis, which can be achieved by providing specific training for medical staff.  We need to introduce multidisciplinary person-centred care which would include treatment plans that were consistent and available nationally, dedicated follow-up care with specific points of contact for patients and outpatient care to help avoid further hospital admissions.  All patients with heart failure should be offered a personalised long-term care plan to help them manage their condition and we need to expand primary care to include medical staff trained in heart failure in order to facilitate care for people in their communities.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the work that has already been undertaken with the heart failure programme.  The objectives and aims of that programme readily complement the heart failure networks and the programme is certainly going in the right direction.  However, the most recent update of the programme was in 2012 and while some hospitals were taking part, they are mainly located on the east coast.  I firmly believe that, with a renewed effort, we can successfully meet the challenges posed by heart failure.  I attended the launch of the policy toolkit in Brussels yesterday and a wide variety of politicians and clinicians from across Europe were present.  This is not an issue that is peculiar to Ireland but is common throughout European and the condition impacts upon some 15 million people.  Patients from Italy and France who had suffered heart attacks and heart failure and who were not given any follow-up or long-term personalised care plans spoke about their conditions.  There is a great need to develop the toolkit strategy and we have a marvellous opportunity to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000028#AA00600","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1443616200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He is correct about everything he said.  It is not just an Irish problem, but, indeed, an international problem.  Europe does well when member states do things together.  World Heart Day was founded in 2000 to inform people about heart disease and its prevention.  This year the theme is creating heart healthy environments.  The day is intended to spread awareness that premature deaths from cardiovascular disease can be avoided if the risk factors, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol, can be controlled.  I am sure the Deputy heard all about this yesterday.  Healthy Ireland provides a framework that supports heart healthy environments.  It includes strategies on tobacco and alcohol.  The Department is currently revising its healthy eating guidelines and is developing an obesity policy and action plan, which will be finalised this year.  The Department's Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019 was launched in 2010.  Subsequent to that, the HSE established three key clinical programmes for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and stroke.<\/p>  <p>  Significant improvements have been made with regard to access to acute treatments for coronary heart disease and heart failure as well as the development of stroke units across the country.  Heart failure, HF, is one of the major chronic diseases in Ireland today and is one of the commonest reasons, as the Deputy pointed out, for hospital admission in the elderly, often requiring a prolonged stay.  It is recognised that integrated management programmes for heart failure, encompassing primary care and hospital services, can produce significant reductions in the need for hospitalisation and achieve better quality of life and outcomes for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's national clinical programme for heart failure aims to reorganise the way heart failure patients are managed.  Recent developments include structured services of acute heart failure.  Such services have been established in 11 hospitals as national heart failure units.  These sites have introduced a structured specialist hospital service for patients presenting with acute heart failure, including post-discharge follow up.  They deliver an integrated service through the model of care developed by the national clinical programme for heart failure, which follows international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  A new diagnostic clinic in the Gorey-Wexford-St.Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Group provides direct access for general practitioners to specialist blood tests and echocardiography in the community with remote specialist advice on echocardiography results and specialist review of patients in the community when required.  This improves access for patients to diagnostics and specialist advice.  A heart failure integrated care demonstration project in the Carlow-Kilkenny region is planned to commence shortly.  It will demonstrate integration between primary care, secondary care and the hospital group.  This uses existing e-health technology and will strengthen patient self-care with enhanced nursing supports and training.<\/p>  <p> Co-ordinated care between primary and secondary care will provide rapid access to specialist opinion and will support identification of heart failure patients in GP practice.  It will also provide specialist day care advice to general practice for rapid but non-urgent cases.  Appropriate use of specialist advice and avoiding need for hospital and outpatient attendance has been a key target of this programme.  Recognising that giving GPs access to senior specialist advice in a structured and timely manner will avert the need for OPD and emergency department referral, led to the development of a consultation service where GPs, practice nurses and specialist staff interact using web conference technology to discuss and manage cases collaboratively.  This also allows simultaneous education for the health care professionals as they discuss relevant cases.  I will deal with the Deputy's other questions in my supplementary reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000029#BB00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1443616200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I welcome the contents, particularly in the context of the national clinical programme for heart failure.  The health failure policy toolkit can have a role in this.  It has been rolled out across Europe and there should be liaison on this.  I intend to follow up with the Department on this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State has acknowledged many times, there is constant negativity around our health services and the negativity is so pervasive and persistent that it often overshadows and ignores the thousands of positive outcomes every day in every hospital and primary care unit.   The negativity is bound to affect staff morale, etc. but it cannot be used to detract from the task before us.  Ensuring the health service is efficient and provides timely, effective treatment is a mammoth task.  I acknowledge the Department's role and the demands it faces regarding all illnesses and conditions.  It is difficult to decide on how to allocate resources, particularly when there is constant strain on the national resources.<\/p>  <p>  Under the national cancer strategy introduced by a previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 1996 and its successor, which was published in 2006, cancer services have been transformed and, therefore, I hope a unified approach to heart failure can be adopted throughout the country and across Europe, which takes on board best practice and the best models.  The health failure policy toolkit can work and there should be credit where credit is due.  The strategy on cancer care under the former Minister, Mary Harney, has worked in many ways and has contributed to improved outcomes.  Ultimately, the improvements in cancer outcomes have proven beyond doubt the positive benefits of the development and use of clear national strategies.  I hope this can be done for heart failure.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the contents of the policy toolkit and development strategy for tackling this condition in conjunction with that has been planned and rolled out.  As our population ages, this condition will become more prevalent and it will cause more serious issues, including financial problems, which will land on the desks of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000029#BB00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1443616200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this significant issue.  Three of the 11 hospitals involved are outside the greater Dublin region - Wexford, Cavan and Sligo.  I agree with him there should be services in every significant area of population.  I constantly say that the solution to overcrowded hospitals is within primary care and this is where this programme needs to go.  This morning, we launched the diabetes in primary care programme, which will be delivered throughout the country in a primary care setting.  It is about the management of a chronic disease and this is where the heart failure programme needs to go as well.  That is where it is heading and we will increasingly provide for the management of chronic conditions in the primary care sector, of which HF will be one.  I do not believe in the doomsday scenario, nor does the Deputy, but one must make one's case.  If Healthy Ireland has an impact on how we live our lives and ensures we do not end up with heart failure because of alcohol abuse, tobacco use or inactivity, the future will be much brighter.  However, a significant cohort will always end up with HF and we need to ensure they are managed in their communities where they feel most comfortable and where they are best known.

There is no doubt that there has been an assault on the hours available to home helps across the country over the past number of years.  A total of 1.4 million fewer hours are available now compared to 2010.  From a policy point of view, it does not make sense to curtail the number of home help hours available to families that are under huge pressure and stress trying to care for a loved one at home.  Home helps are an integral part of the delivery of health care, as patients transfer from an acute hospital setting to a home care setting.  However, people are scrounging on a daily basis to access additional hours.  They contact local public representatives, including Deputies, to beg and plead for more hours.  The number of hours available is not sufficient to cater for the demand.<\/p>  <p>  There is a key problem regarding HSE-employed home helps who are being blackguarded to a certain extent.  People who have a contract for X hours cannot secure additional hours.  I cannot understand the preference for private companies that provide home help hours.  When one does the sums, it does not make economic sense to be preferential towards private companies.  It must be acknowledged that HSE-employed home helps have provided a critical, integral service in our communities for many years but the notion that they must work a set number of hours and cannot access additional hours is distasteful.<\/p><p>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would revisit that policy, which seems to be ingrained on the part of HSE management, to reduce, on a continual basis, HSE employed home helps and preference private companies.  If there was a logical or an economic reason for doing that, one could understand it but, by any stretch of the imagination or assessment, there is no benefit gained from operating in this way.  I ask the Minister of State to revisit that issue in the broader context.<\/p> <p> There are instances where people are being provided with a half and hour of home help care.  What can a person do in half an hour?  There is a need for the Minister of State to fundamentally review the number of hours of home help care available across the country.  Taking account of the regions, there has been an appalling assault on the hours available.  Some 1.4 million fewer home help hours are being provided than was the case in 2010.  We have an aging population; the demographic curve is in that direction.  The stated policy is to transfer people from an acute hospital setting to a home-care setting, yet Government policy in this area leads to the opposite being the case.  One of the main reasons we have overcrowded emergency departments - and bedlam and chaos in them on a continual basis - is that we cannot transfer people from an acute hospital setting back to a community-based or home-care setting.  An integral element in ensuring that people can remain at home is their level of access to home help care.<\/p> <p> In the context of the budget, I urge the Minister of State to not only review the number of home help hours available nationally but also to ensure that home helps employed by the HSE are treated fairly and with dignity and that they are not be continually blackguarded in terms of their hours being consistently reduced and priority and preference being given to private companies.  It does not appear that the Minister of State can inform me as to why that is the practice, whether there is a rationale for it or whether a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out.  I have been contacted by home helps whose hours have been significantly reduced from 40 to 15.  Their basic original contract was for 15 hours, yet they had been working many hours in excess of that for the past number of years.  However, when it came to the renewal of their home help hours or providing care for a new client, those hours have been given to private companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000029#BB00400","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443616800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I am aware of the time constraints and the fact that the clock is ticking.  The question the Deputy put down relates to the need for the Minister for Health to improve working conditions for home helps.  The Deputy has moved into the broader region and I may be able to deal with that issue in a response to a supplementary question.<\/p>  <p>  I  thank the Deputy for raising this issue. While there will always be a need for long-term residential care for the older people in our society, it is important that those who wish to stay in their own homes and communities are supported and facilitated to do this and for as long as possible.  It is also important that we support the return of those who have required acute hospital care to their homes.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the HSE will spend &euro;330 million on home care packages and home help services including &euro;185 million to provide 10.3 million home help hours.  These services are provided in two ways, either directly by the HSE or by private or voluntary organisations funded by the HSE.  Home help services are provided mainly by staff directly employed by the HSE.  However, in the greater Dublin area, Wicklow and Clare, home help services are provided by voluntary providers on behalf of the executive.  The terms and conditions of home helps have been the subject of detailed consideration.  A home help contract introduced for HSE employees in 2014 followed on from a lengthy consultative process on a range of issues that commenced in 2012.  The discussions took place between the HSE and the unions under the auspices of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  The annualised contract which emanated and was accepted is fundamental to both parties as it matches the actual workforce to the changing needs of the service.  It also gives certainty to employees by way of guaranteed weekly minimum paid weekly minimum paid hours.  Voluntary providers are funded under section 39 of the Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has in place service level agreements with these providers which set out the level of home help service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and which contain requirements in respect of standards of care.  As the home helps employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, the HSE does not determine the salaries or other terms and conditions to apply to these staff, including pension arrangements.  Accordingly, the arrangements offered by individual providers will vary. The pay and superannuation terms and conditions of the staff concerned are not subject to the control of the Department of Health and they are not classified as public servants. The granting of any pension entitlement in such circumstances is a complex matter.  Access for home helps in voluntary organisations to a pension has been the subject of a number of Labour Court recommendations involving SIPTU, IMPACT and the HSE.  Implementation of a Labour Court recommendation on payment of a gratuity to the home helps employed by the section 39 organisations has been hindered in recent years by the budgetary situation and is further complicated by the fact that the HSE is not the employer.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the issue was discussed during the recent Lansdowne Road talks and that the parties reached agreement on a process for giving formal consideration to the matter. The parties agreed to establish, in the short term, a working group to examine a number of issues, including gratuity payments for home helps.  This process will now be progressed following the recent ratification of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  As Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, I am committed to providing the necessary supports and assistance to allow our growing elderly population to remain in their homes and to provide good working conditions for  those who can facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000030#CC00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1443616800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I am aware that there were long, protracted discussions and negotiations in the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in the context of trying to find an agreed basis for contracts for HSE-employed home helps.  A home help who had X number of hours calculated on a base year - and I understand the number was roughly 80% of that - would have a set minimum contract but they would often have been given additional hours.  The difficulty is that their hours in excess of the minimum contract are being pared back and given to private companies.  As a result, there is a preference in the allocation of hours over and above those in the minimum contract which the HSE is obliged to honour.  In case after case, home helps employed by the HSE are only being given the minimum contract hours.  The contract refers to minimum weekly paid hours.  There is no necessity for the HSE to deny them extra hours.  Home helps across the country are still receiving the base minimum contract number of hours but they have been working extra hours in recent years.  When the time comes to review their hours, those in excess of what is stated in the minimum contract are being given to private companies and the home helps hours are being reduced to the minimum.  In this way, the HSE is meeting its basic obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Why is there an obsession among HSE management, and as is evident in policy, to deny HSE-employed home helps extra hours when additional hours are being allocated to an individual?  That seems to be the case.  I have spoken to many home helps - I spoke to two of them before I came to the Chamber - and they have confirmed that is the case.  They are now receiving the minimum number of hours when they would have been allocated many more hours up to now.

This really gets to the heart of the matter because we are going to have to put money into meeting targets and dealing with climate change.  This is why the Government does not want to commit to these targets and why it did not want the afforestation targets I proposed in the forestry Bill.  Generally, the Government does not like targets because they are measurable and specific.  It likes very general targets that can be pushed way out into the future so it cannot be held accountable as to whether tangible progress has been made towards meeting general aspirational targets, and as we know with so many of the Government&rsquo;s aspirational targets announced a few years out.  For example, in response to one of the topical issues of the moment, the Government said it was going to get rid of homelessness by 2016.  Here we are approaching 2016 but we are going in the opposite direction in dealing with the problem.  It sounded very good when it was initially proposed.

They sound good now but often will not materialise unless there is a clear tangible roadmap towards the achievement of those targets and where we can measure our progress on a yearly basis.<\/p>  <p>  That is why many of us on this side of the House are pushing for more specific binding targets.

If we do not, then we are not serious about dealing with climate change.

Basically, it provides that the national mitigation plan would specify the projected levels of emissions once the policy measures outlined are agreed.

We are proposing that we should specify clearly the projected levels of emissions once the policy measures outlined have been agreed.  It is the logical thing to do.

The purpose of this amendment is to embed a little more detail in the legislation.  As it stands the Bill does not require that the plan achieve anything at all.  There are no targets, measurements or solid objectives, just fluff about the ill-defined low carbon economy.  This amendment would mean that, in theory, the plan had some type of objective or at least those drawing up the plan would have to make an argument for the decisions that made some type of logical sense as regards the specific outcomes of individual actions specified in the plan.<\/p><p>I do not know if people noticed it, although I am sure some did, but yesterday Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of the England, made an interesting statement about this very issue.  He outlined in very stark terms the financial risk of global warming and he acknowledged there was a danger the assets of fossil fuel companies could be left stranded by tougher rules to curb climate change.  He said the exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge, with 19% of FTSE 100 companies being in natural resource and extraction industries.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come.  ...once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.<\/blockquote><p>He went on to say the carbon budget the world could afford, if it is to meet the 2&deg; Celsius target, amounts to between one fifth and one third of the world's proven reserves of oil, gas and coal.  If that estimate is even approximately correct, he said, it would render the vast majority of reserves stranded - oil, gas and coal that would be literally unburnable without expensive carbon capture technology, which itself alters fossil fuel economics.  A wholesale reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilise markets.<br\/><br\/>Those like Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, have not been the ones we have associated very much with taking strong action on climate change.  I think people are slowly waking up.  I would like the Government to take his thoughts on board because we seem to be very slow to wake up to what is happening.  Scotland was doing things better many years ago than we are doing now.  It is not good enough and the Government needs to reconsider its position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000033#FF01000","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443618600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>The response to everything we have raised in terms of projections and targets is that we do not need these things in Ireland because we are already the subject of EU targets.  Of course, that is to be completely blind to the reality that, while we may be subject to those targets, we are also on target to miss them and be well off the radar in terms of achieving them in any meaningful way by 2020.  This means the Irish taxpayer will be the subject of massive fines, apart from the fact Irish and world humanity is going to be jeopardised by a failure to come to terms with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, the Bill does not require the national mitigation plan to achieve anything - that is the reality.  What this amendment seeks is that it would be a requirement in the plan to include projected national emissions as a goal.  I do not believe that is unreasonable; in fact, it makes perfect logical sense.  For the Government to refuse to take this into account shows the same type of mentality we had on the earlier amendment, when the Minister was quite happy for the Government of the day to railroad through whatever was put forward and undermine participative democracy in this House.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace is correct.  We are dealing here with very serious issues and, in some ways, with the future of humanity.  Even those at the higher levels or elements of the capitalist system are coming to grasp that our world is jeopardised by our inability to deal with this.  The problem is that while we are talking one thing, the reality of what we are delivering is quite the opposite.  We need to be much more radical in our thinking and much more definitive in the plan we put forward.  There are some allusions to a way forward in the Bill before us but no meat and no substance.  When we weigh up the Bill with all of the other actions the Government has stood over, the reality is that we know this country, far from reaching its targets, is moving further from achieving those targets.<\/p>  <p>  That is why we say austerity is contributing to this.  In fairness, the group in Canada headed up by Naomi Klein have put forward the Leap Manifesto, which is based on tackling climate change in a serious way.  That manifesto, which was put to public representatives, states that austerity itself is a fossilised form of thinking that has become a threat to life on earth.  What they mean is that systematically attacking low carbon sectors like education and health care, as the Government has done, starving public transport and forcing reckless energy privatisation demonstrates a fossilised form of thinking which is a threat to life on earth.  We can draw parallels here in our system.<\/p>  <p>  The manifesto refers to needing the money for that great transformation in how society is ordered, and we need the right policies to achieve that.  Ending fossil fuel subsidies, a financial transactions tax, increased resource royalties, higher income taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, a progressive carbon tax and cuts to military spending - all of these measures are real \"producer pays\" measures which could tackle the emissions we are seeking to deal with.  Instead, we have a waffly, fluffy Bill that does not actually set out to achieve anything and, meanwhile, other policies are being implemented which ensure we will not reach our targets and that we are actually heading in the opposite direction.<\/p>  <p>  I believe this amendment is worthy and should be included because it measures what we should be doing and, in some way, anchors this plan to some form of reality, which would then have an impact on other aspects of Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000034#GG00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1443618600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I have made the historical point once before and it is always a point that strikes me very forcefully, so I will make it again as I think it very relevant to the debate about climate change and the future capacity of our society to sustain itself.  The historical point is this.  The reason the great civilisations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, which were the first great civilisations created by human beings, collapsed was that the people who ran those civilisations failed to invest in and sustain the infrastructure and basis on which those civilisations had arisen.  Great advances in technology, in industry and in knowledge which had led to the development of those societies were completely undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people who ran them, who started to use that wealth and resources, not to sustain their civilisation, but essentially to aggrandise themselves.  This is symbolised in things like pyramids, where the massive pyramids built were of no use to the society but were just monuments to the power and self-importance of the rulers and Pharaohs.  Similar things were done in ancient Mesopotamia.  This was instead of investing in infrastructure, both human and physical, and the means through which those societies sustained themselves.<\/p>  <p>  In those days, it was the question of irrigated canal systems around the great rivers which allowed those societies to rise.  That same scenario is now playing out in the world where, literally, the basis of our civilisation is being undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people at the top.<\/p><p>They have the technological, industrial and intellectual capacity to sustain our civilisation and help it progress and develop in the interests of the whole of humanity, but they fail to do that and instead use all the wealth and resources to aggrandise themselves, spending on wasteful, damaging and dangerous things that threaten to undermine the basis of society.  That is what is going on.<\/p> <p> We look at the terrifying displacement of millions of people in parts of the world because of what the western world has done in those places and think it is bad now, but we have yet to see the impact of runaway climate change.  It is already a major contributory factor to displacement of millions of people in these areas, but displacement will get out of control if we do not take action now.  The scenes we have seen in the past few weeks will be as nothing.  They will pale into insignificance compared to what is coming down the line unless we deal with this matter.  Countries like Ireland, with its reputation as a green country, are deeply implicated by failing to act on this matter which is having a devastating effect in the developing world.  Our CO2 emissions are 80 times greater than countries like Malawi, but these countries are suffering the devastating consequences of what we have done and are doing to the environment.  Despite this and the consequences being wreaked on these countries, we still think in our narrow self-serving way that we should not do anything that might impact adversely on our short-term, narrow self interest.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Stanley pointed out, it is not in our self interest.  In the whole of Europe, Ireland is one of the countries set to be worst hit by rising sea levels.  This will be a mammoth cost to the State.  We have already seen the impact of flooding, but the costs we have seen to date will be as nothing compared to the cost that will affect us in the coming years if we do not do something about it now.  Yet, the Government sets its face against doing anything concrete.  It must be seen to do something, so we get a Bill full of vague, meaningless aspirations but with nothing we can be tied to, nothing that will cost us anything.  As Deputy Clare Daly rightly said, this is linked to austerity.  Ultimately, our inability to invest in the sort of long-term measures necessary to deal with this is the flip side of the coin of paying out &euro;8 billion in interest to the bankers and the bondholders - modern pharaohs in historic terms.  They are the modern version of the pharaohs who dug the grave of ancient civilization.  The same gang is doing it for our civilization, while we are on our bended knees obeying their every command and refusing to take any action in a range of areas.  <\/p> <p> Climate change is one of the most important issues, this global question of whether our planet can sustain food production and prevent massive flooding that will put significant parts of the globe under water, including parts of this country.  Parts of our country will be devastated, as we have seen from river flooding already.  Yet, the Government has set its face against change and seems uninterested.  It wants to be able to say it passed the Bill, but it is not really interested.<\/p> <p> Earlier I gave an example of this lack of interest that drives me mad.  When I proposed specific amendments to the Forestry Bill when it was going through the House, proposing annual targets for greater levels of afforestation, the Government's answer was \"No\".  It was not interested.  A shocking fact that many people in this country are unaware of is that the State forestry company, Coillte, is not allowed engage in afforestation, because of EU rules.  That is madness, yet nobody is raising it as an issue.  We are talking about dealing with climate change, but the State forestry company which was set up to plant trees is prohibited from planting them by EU state aid rules.  It is madness but the Government does not want to do anything about it.  Instead, we continually submit to the people who inflict this madness on us or to those whose economic interests or personal or corporate wealth is dependent on us doing nothing.  We act as their lickspittles and servants.<\/p> <p> The culmination of this is a Bill that will do nothing and in four, five, ten or 15 years time, when the crisis has got worse, the Government of the day will blame the previous lot, who are then all retired, and say it is their fault.  That Government will then say it will do something and will come up with another plan that will be long on aspiration and short on detail and the same process will continue.  It is time to stop this nonsense and be specific and that is what this amendment is about.  Be specific and be tied to targets.  Any government can be measured against specific projections on CO2 emissions and targets to assess whether it is serious.  If we did this now, we would discover very quickly that we are not serious at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000034#GG00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443619200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Cowen as amendment No. 35 is in this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000035#HH00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1443619200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will press my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000035#HH00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1443619200,"counter":599,"content":"<p>By serendipity, I am in the Chamber this afternoon, due to a change of schedule.

However, I doubt it.<\/p><p>What Deputy Boyd Barrett said about the collapse of civilization is correct.  It is when the titans of the day build monuments to themselves in their own interest that a greater number of people, the citizens of the world suffer.  The pyramids of old were made with blocks of stone, but today's pyramids are the quantitative easing in the financial markets and the credit pyramid.  That credit pyramid is controlled by far too few people.  These people are getting fewer and that is where the danger lies.<\/p><p>It is interesting to reflect for a moment on the great exodus from the Middle East through eastern European countries to western European countries.  Rivers of humanity are moving west with only the clothes on their backs.  The relevant committees here in the west then try to segregate and grade these people on whether they are true refugees or economic migrants.  How absurd.  Then, from abroad, the giants of our small country dare to comment on these matters and this grading.  They themselves are economic migrants because they do not like paying tax in the country of their birth.  I do not want to name these people, but everybody knows that six names pop up in this regard.  Sometimes these people pay tax by self-assessment, by way of a charity cheque to their home town schools or hospitals.<\/p><p>The wealth and capital these people have has earned from 6% to 8% minimum over the past 25 years, as authoritative writers and researchers have explained.  To make understanding this easy, I invite everybody here to see the easy 50-minute version of what people like Stiglitz, Piketty, Krugman and Carmen Reinhart have put hundreds of hours into writing.  They can see it on a home-produced David McWilliams programme - 50 minutes of the truth.  The establishment here thinks it can accept what its advisers, who provide little press release snatches of what might sound good for the <i>status quo<\/i>, say but it is not the truth.<\/p><p>It leaves maybe up to 2 million people unnecessarily hurt by the unfair divide that has taken place in the so-called recovery.<\/p> <p> The truth is simple.  It is simply explained and, as Deputy Daly said, Bills like this are fluffy palliatives, that is all.  They do not specify or get concrete but on 15 October, there will be a very concrete formula of algebra to tax the middle, the lower middle and the very low.  It will be so concrete that, like the 93 year-old lady yesterday, they will be suddenly snapping out of the hypnosis of fear in court or with bailiffs at the door.<\/p> <p> It is strange, but we are here to talk about these things and to legislate, not to confuse.  We can make the laws simpler, less complex.  Imagine reading a book when, every now and then, a new page or half page was put in and one was taken out.  It would not make sense.  The simplest income tax return form is now 26 pages long.  The little lady was told, \"Well, if you ring up a number, you can get an explanation about the documentation\" that came from the department of broadcasting or whatever it is called, but she cannot do so.  The truth is that if one rings a so-called lo-call or free 1850 number, one gets a menu which even I, who am fairly okay on the uptake, have trouble understanding.  Button one is this, button two is that and button three is the other.  One waits and tries to hold but will it be button one or could it be button six?  This is for an elderly person - ring up and get it explained.  She cannot even get through and, if she does, the call might be sent to a call centre in Scotland or Mumbai.

Banks enter into loans with people to house and raise a family for up to 30 years, and only a sixth of the way through the original loan term, they say, &quot;We are changing it and splitting it.&quot;  They say to people they think they can handle part A for the rest of their working lives and that they will freeze part B until 25 years later.  By the way, they win all the time, because when people retire on a State pension, if they are lucky, they will activate the other loan with the cumulative hidden interest.  That is the climate those families live in.  If they cannot honour - listen to the word &quot;honour&quot; - the restructured nonsense, the bank has gone on with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000036#JJ00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1443619800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley's amendment mentions emissions.

Do not talk about recovery; it is an outcome at the moment.  It is recovery for those few who own the capital and the wealth - the 6% to 8% growth, steady for the last 25 years.  Those guys over there in numbers are afraid to write an assessment invoice to the multinational corporations to cough up.  Forget 12.5% - say even an 8% effective rate of tax.  The Government has not got the guts to send out the invoice.  They would pay it.  I have done the research.  They would not even blink.  That is the truth of it.<\/p>  <p>  Like the weather and climate change, which the Bill is all about, they are even getting to that point now.  When they had their last conversations, these people, the OECD and so on, said, \"We have got to recognise realities and it will be happening anyway.\"  In the meantime the open goal was missed.  There was a national recovery opportunity to say to the multinational corporations, \"Our people are hurting\".<\/p>  <p>  It is all because boards of banks created a credit pyramid, bringing us back to where we started in this conversation.  Nobody else did.  It was not the developers, by the way.  The papers have got all that wrong.  The balance sheets prove where the problem was - it was credit.  The proof is that the banks are, by their own admission, correcting their balance sheets to the proper loan to deposit ratios.  That means they must have made a mistake, and as they say, they are correcting it.  If they made the mistake, why are the people paying for it with the second split mortgages?<\/p>  <p>  I have taken a little liberty, but these things are all connected.  If the Minister of State does not see that they are connected, then we are missing it.  We are being juvenile about things.  We have got to get honest.  These are the things that should be discussed in Cabinet.  These are the big picture responsibilities, not the little selfish things about how to get in and whether we have a good representation and saying,  \"A few more roads down in Cork to Limerick - that should do it\" for this constituency and that.  That is not the way to think.<\/p>  <p>  Anyway, I am glad I came in.  I heard very relevant and valuable contributions.

In the meantime other countries have gone even further than that.  In Ireland, however, we are presented with legislation without targets.  The plan for tackling greenhouse gases will be presented in two years' time despite examples of what needs to be done being evident across the world.<\/p><p>The UNIPCC report indicates there is a 95% certainty that climate change is occurring mainly because of greenhouse gases released by human activity, above the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.  If the Minister of State is serious about tackling climate change and averting environmental disaster, we need to take rapid action.  We know what needs to be done.

There are ambitious targets to be met in Harvest 2020, which the agriculture sector has gone a long way towards meeting.  The issue that will arise will be that of trying to meet the capacity and keeping within our greenhouse gas emission limits in terms of our international obligations and whatever national obligations we set out.  <\/p><p>There is great pressure to increase output.  We must be careful how we manage this because if we do not do it the right way, the Government of the day, whatever its composition will be, will have to buy carbon credits to offset any overrun of greenhouse gas emissions if we do not take remedial measures and if we do not diversify.  We have very strong beef and dairy sectors and they must be protected and improved.  The jobs being created in those sectors are very welcome, particularly the new jobs in the food industry.  That is all positive, as is the increase in our exports in that sector.  However, there are limits in terms of market demands.  Without going into this in great depth, we know from what has happened in America that beef exports have not been the silver bullet that people thought they would be.  The beef and dairy sectors have their limits.<\/p><p>Twelve months ago the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, called for a significant increase in dairy output, that there would be no fear of it distorting the market for dairy produce.  Many farmers might disagree with that now, with those markets which they are serving showing a downward pull on prices.<\/p> <p> We need to look at other areas in farming where we can produce.  We also need to look at those sectors in which we are importing a substantial amount of food produce which could be produced here.  The beet sector is one.  The indigenous sugar beet industry was closed in 2006.  The plan then was to build apartments on the sugar factory site in Carlow on the banks of the River Barrow.  The only building on it now is the tower from the old beet plant with the thistles and buachal&aacute;ns growing around it.<\/p> <p> This amendment addresses the need to diversify into more mixed farming.  In some ways, it is going back to the future.  We used to be a significant sugar beet growing country, a position to which we need to go back.  In the context of this Bill, sugar beet is important because it can act as a break crop, as well as a good cover crop in acting as a carbon sink.  Those of us who have ever worked in a beet field will know it is a broad-leafed plant for several months, meaning it is a good covering crop and excellent as a carbon sink.  It does not emit greenhouse gas whereas cattle do.<\/p> <p>We need to be looking more at developing the tillage sector and root crops, such as sugar beet.  Research and practice on the Continent shows sugar beet can be used not just in sugar but also in bioethanol production, proving it is a viable industry.  This State imports about &euro;400 million sugar products every year, a substantial amount of money going out of the State, affecting the balance of payments.<\/p> <p> This is an opportunity to look more seriously at this area.  The Minister will be aware of attempts to restart the indigenous sugar industry.  We must try to have a plant operating the whole year around.  This is a win-win.  It does not generate greenhouse gas emissions.  Sugar beet is a good cash crop and, for several months of the year, it is a valuable carbon sink crop as it is a broad-leafed covering crop.  From June, a good beet field would be completely covered in green right up to when the beet is pulled in October.  I have often seen it left in the ground as late as December.  It is important we look at that and diversify.  I tabled this amendment to further develop the tillage sector, mixed farming and particularly crops that can act as carbon sinks.  It makes sense from an environmental, a financial and a social point of view.<\/p> <p> Week in, week out, we talk about rural development and developing local economies.  The loss of the sugar beet industry had a significant impact on the midlands and the south east.  One can blame the previous Government for that and get into the blame game but tomorrow is the first day of the future.  Greencore wound up with the bulk of the compensation package for the closure of the sugar factories while farmers got some of it.  The former workers and contractors did not get a whole lot, however.  I remember being at meetings when the sugar factory was closed and it was like being at a funeral.  Farmers were annoyed.  Beet is a good sustainable cash crop and very good for crop rotation.  Now, farmers are growing other break crops for grain and barley but these are not good cash crops.  Farmers and experts will maintain beet is good for the ground in giving back nutrients to the soil.  This makes sense from an environmental, economic and social point of view, as well as importantly getting money into our local economies and keeping people working locally.  I implore the Minister of State to accept this amendment in the spirit it has been put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000044#RR04100","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I strongly endorse Deputy Stanley's amendment.  Monoculture or overdependence on one or two agricultural sectors is a very dangerous game.  We need to diversify enterprise and industry generally, as well as agriculture.  The idea we would have an ever onwards and upwards beef export industry or we can solely rely on the beef and dairy sector is a mistake.  It makes us vulnerable to any sort of serious fluctuations, increased competition, diseases and other factors which could potentially hit a single sector and, therefore, make the entire economy vulnerable.  We learned about the folly of overconcentration on a particular sector with the property crash.  It would be devastating if we did not learn the same in the areas of agriculture which we have prioritised.  One has to have diversity in this sector basically for safety, sustainability and protection of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know as much as Deputy Stanley does about the sugar beet sector and the sugar industry.  However, it is an amazing fact that even in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, people regularly approach me to decry the collapse of the indigenous sugar industry and that it was a national tragedy to allow it to happen.  The passion and conviction with which this point is put, a point echoed by Deputy Stanley, coming from an area very much affected, indicates the need to take the resurrection of that industry seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Another important sector in which we have desperately underperformed and allowed to decline is forestry.  Of course, there were historical reasons it was devastated under British rule.  It is an absolute tragedy and shame that in the country in Europe which has the best conditions for growing trees, we have the lowest level of forest cover.  This is a perfect crop for addressing climate change, CO2 emissions, as well as dealing with the consequences of climate change and environmental damage and yet we have failed spectacularly to develop the sector.  In so far as we have developed it, again it has been on a monocultural basis with one crop being prioritised, which has questionable effects on soil and water quality, as well as making it vulnerable to disease.  This is an area in which we should be diversifying and expanding to a significant extent.<\/p><p>There are many other such areas but a focus on the diversification of crops to develop industry, enterprise and agriculture could be beneficial in terms of meeting our targets.  It would be environmentally sustainable and good economically, socially and in every other way.  This must be a key part of our moving towards a sustainable future and dealing with climate change.<\/p> <p> It is a reasonable and sensible amendment and I see no reason the Minister of State would not accept it.  It is very much the direction in which we need to go if we are to think outside the box and widen our horizons.  In some cases, we need just go back to things we used to do.  This was a forest-covered country.  We also had a sugar industry.  Both of those have been devastated but there are things in these areas we could do terribly well, realising multiple benefits at every level.  The Minister of State should accept the amendment.  More important, however, this Government and future Governments need to take the spirit of the amendment seriously in addressing not just climate change but also a sustainable economic and environmental future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000045#SS00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443624000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I have listened with interest for the past few minutes to my learned colleagues from D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Portlaoise speaking about the sugar industry and its benefit to the country over many years, which is true.  There is one particular and important point my colleague from Portlaoise omitted, however, which is that his colleagues in the European Parliament recently voted to restrict the production of sugar within Europe.  At the same time, we are trying to ensure there is a viable industry here.  It is important to make the point that we cannot have it both ways.  Either we want it or we do not.  In the past it was very important to us to have an industry such an this one but it was taken from us by the people to my left, who seem to forget that fact whenever it suits them.  It is important that my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in are not hypocritical about the situation.  They are looking for an industry to return, something we all want, but have a different view on it in the European Parliament.  That should not be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we have diversity.  We have diversity at present in agriculture, which has changed considerably over the past 20 or 30 years.  That point must also not be forgotten.  Beef and dairy farmers are constantly monitoring what their cattle are producing to ensure it can be minimised to best effect.  They also have an important role to play in terms of the future.  We cannot keep blaming agriculture and farming in general for the current situation.  It is important that we move on from that.

There will be, and already is, a full engagement with all sectors, including the agricultural sector, to identify appropriate and sustainable carbon sinks.  That will be the opportunity to include these mitigation measures.

The purpose of these amendments is to enshrine the independence of the advisory council into law.  It is very much based on the statutory framework for the Fiscal Advisory Council.  The amendment is modelled on a provision in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and section 8(1) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  If it is sufficiently important to enshrine the independence of the Fiscal Advisory Council in law, I do not see why there would not be a similar logic to doing so for the climate advisory council.  We are talking about the future of humanity and I, therefore, think it is sufficiently important.  To quote Friends of the Earth on the subject:<\/p><blockquote>The independence of the Fiscal Advisory Council is underpinned by law.  The same protection is essential for the Climate Advisory Council, especially with ex-officio members who might otherwise be looking over their shoulders to their Boards and stakeholders.<\/blockquote><p>That is essentially it.  I am not sure if it was the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, or the Minister who signalled on Committee Stage a preparedness to incorporate this provision into the legislation.

Despite the fact that I may have issues with some of the recommendations of the Fiscal Advisory Council, I see the benefit of having an independent group of economists assessing the wider economy, what the Government is doing, its budgets and setting out whether it thinks there are dangers.  The reports and figures it produces are very useful.  In that sense, it is quite a good model and one which should be followed in this area of equal if not, arguably, much greater importance, which is an area that concerns the management of our environment so that it remains sustainable for human existence and society.<\/p><p>It does not get much more important than that.

The key point, however, is what is stated in the report from the all-party environment committee.

If the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, is expected to produce its report within ten days, this is at least as important and should be on a par with it.

I am surprised by the practice because when information is available in county councils, it is provided to councillors almost straight away.  Over the past four and a half years, I have been surprised by the Government's system of making announcements and having launches, but Members have to wait until they get the newspapers the next day to find out what was said.  I know this situation is slightly different, but where an annual report is available to the Minister, it should be available to Members and the public within ten days.  There is no reason for it not to be.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister wants the public to buy into this, we cannot do it in a semi-secret way or by way of delay or procrastination.  The more open we are the better.  We have nothing to fear and we want the public to be involved.  Perception is sometimes everything.

By way of explanation for what is already in the Bill, the 30-day timeframe is to provide an opportunity for the annual report to be seen by the Government before it is published.

The first periodic review will, of course, be an important one, in that it is specifically charged with analysing the progress made in meeting our mitigation targets up to the year 2020 under the EU&rsquo;s effort sharing decision of 2009.  Of course, I understand why some would wish to see this timeframe shortened but I believe that we also have to be realistic in what we can expect of the council.<\/p>  <p>  The council is not a full-time entity, although it will have at its disposal a secretariat to be provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Moreover, it will require a certain amount of time to bed down the operational structures of the council and then to begin its work of collating and analysing all available relevant information and data.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect the council to do all this, and turn around a major review of mitigation policy and implementation in Ireland, within just six months.  <\/p>  <p>  We all want the first periodic review report to be a substantive and challenging piece of work, and to genuinely add value to the work being undertaken by the State&rsquo;s institutions in achieving progress on mitigation.

Given the capabilities of some of the personnel on the expert advisory council and the importance of its task, nobody is going to shoot them if they do not produce a biblical version of the council's findings but they should be able to produce a comprehensive body of work.

The amendment seeks to insert specific reference to possible contributions from different sectors of the economy and different sources of emissions.  This is critical because performance is uneven.  If one looks at the European Commission report on Ireland earlier this year, it graphically makes the point and sets out why we need to specify the different areas.  That report stated that agricultural emissions in Ireland were expected to remain stable between 2005 and 2020.  Although this was technically accurate, the statement glossed over the fact that agricultural greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 9% by 2011 but were now increasing because of Food Harvest 2020 due to the expansion of livestock numbers, particularly dairy cattle, which meant that emissions were already up 4% in the past two years and were predicted to rise up to 2025.  Clearly, this is one sector of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The report dealt with emissions in transport which, again, we are trying to specify here.  It stated in respect of transport, which is the second largest non-emissions trading system sector in terms of emissions, that emissions are expected to increase significantly between 2005 and 2020 due to the lack of public transport.  That has not been addressed.  It looked at the continuing use of coal and increased domestic peat use that has meant that domestic heat carbon emissions rose by 2.6% in 2013 over 2012 levels, with no strategy in place to achieve high levels of household insulation and so on that would deal with this and allow us to switch from coal to low-carbon sources.  We need to specify by sector.  It is very important and contributes to a more bottom-up and meaningful approach to this.  It is critical that we would do this and it feeds into the other discussion we had about who decides about this.  It is much more democratic and accountable to specify it in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000053#AAA00600","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1443627600,"counter":919,"content":"<p>This proposed amendment calls for the expert advisory council to report and provide advice in respect of proposed annual targets - an interim target for 2050 and a final target for 2050.

The amendments are fairly self-explanatory.  They set out the details of the reports that wold be carried out if we had national emissions reduction targets.  Apart from the fact that it has ambitious targets, what is interesting about the Scottish Act is that it has copious detail as to how their advisory group would operate, the work it would do and the contents of the reports it would compile.  There are chapters on the duties of public bodies relating to climate change mitigation, adaptation programmes, land use, forestry, energy efficiency, waste reduction and recycling.  In effect, what Scotland did was write the framework for the mitigation plan into law as part of their climate legislation.  This begs the question as to why we are here, six years later, discussing a Bill that has no targets and no details of any plan and specifies that the plan, whatever it consists of, does not have to exist for another two years after this Bill comes into force.  By the time we have monitored our progress on our first mitigation plan the EU will be knocking on the door telling us to pay up for non-compliance.  <\/p><p>We need joined-up thinking on the issue and we need to start taking action as soon as is humanly possible.  Never has an issue hammered home the idea that everything is connected so powerfully as climate change and yet here we are shirking our responsibilities to the wider world.  Anyone who has read <i>This Changes Everything<\/i>by Naomi Klein will see how this connectivity is very important because everything is connected.  It relates to many areas of how we organise society and the planet.  <\/p><p>We are near the end of the debate on this Bill.  It is not going to be the Bill we would like to have because it leaves much to be desired.  One of these days a group of politicians in Government will wake up and see that things need to be different.  We do not suffer from severe flooding and do not get huge hurricanes or droughts but the truth of the matter is that many parts of the world do and, sadly, we are not playing our part to change that.  We seem to be walking with our eyes closed.  We do not even seem to have an appetite for doing anything about it and it is very frustrating for anyone who takes a long-term vision of where we are in the world today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000056#DDD00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1443629100,"counter":938,"content":"<p>This is the last batch of amendments on what should have been an historic item of legislation for Irish society but which is, unfortunately, a bitter disappointment.  We are launching a last-ditch effort to make it a bit better than it is and all of these amendments are designed to work with legislation, such as the Scottish Act on which we based many of them.  That would have brought about real commitments to nationally-binding emissions targets.  The Minister has repeatedly stated over the past day and a half that we do not need to have this at all and it is a complete and utter irrelevancy as we are all right - we are covered by our legislation because European targets already bind us.  However, we are already not going to meet those targets.<\/p><p>The Minister's faith in the EU and UN for setting targets is misguided.  The 2030 agreements are widely considered to be a climbdown that will make keeping us within the threshold of between 2&deg; and 3&deg; very difficult, if not impossible.  There are already reports that the COP21 Paris talks are being infiltrated by dirty energy lobbying groups who have done their best to undermine international agreements.  At the COP19 Warsaw meeting oil and gas companies, which are obviously key players in causing climate change, actually sponsored some of the talks while the President in Poland co-organised a counter-summit with the coal industry.  The UN has itself proactively worked to bring business, including fossil fuel industries, into the talks and these big businesses have done all they can to block progress, from undermining the science to proposing pie-in-the-sky technological fixes or straightforward public relations spins such as the idea of clean coal.  Everything is being done to ensure they keep profiting regardless of the consequences for the climate.  It is true that some of the more far-sighted administrators of capitalism, such as those who spoke at the banking meetings, have seen that this is damaging and destructive to everybody but lobbying is interfering with what people are trying to do.<\/p><p><i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported recently on a challenge by An Taisce over a planning approval for a &euro;65 million road-widening scheme on the N86 between Tralee and Dingle.  Its core argument was that an environmental impact study should have been carried out on the project.  There was also a report that found that cuts to bus services would leave areas without any bus services at all.  We are building roads without any consideration of the environmental impact while cutting bus services and failing to properly invest in rail.  The NRA is allowed to do whatever it likes, whatever the consequences in terms of transport emissions, and we are continuing to give corporate welfare subsidies in the form of oil and gas fields as a present to fossil fuel companies.  We have to see the Bill in this context.<\/p><p>We are saying we are going to do things, in a waffly way and without much content, but in reality the Government policy is to do the opposite.  An indictment of this is our attitude to public transport, which is completely regrettable.  We undermine rail transport and the delivery of metro lite all around the garden to the airport will not get us back on track in that area.  We have not had any serious rail delivery nor have we had wave energy, offshore wind farms or geothermal stations, all of which we need if we are to seriously address climate change.  Not only do we need the political will to invest in renewable energy as a core part of Ireland's public infrastructure, it is also critical to our collective survival on earth.  We need the political establishment to stand up a bit more to the fossil fuel giants that are happily burning away, regardless of the consequences to ourselves or future generations just as long as profits can be made.  This is all indicative of why we need emission reduction targets.  It is not just because we cannot trust the international process, which is currently being undermined by lobbyists.  The neoliberal policies implemented by this Government are having a negative impact and binding national targets which are independently assessed on a regular basis are the only hope we have of forcing the arm of the parties that comprise the Government and that support policies of austerity to ensure they give a damn about issues that go beyond one election term to another.<\/p><p>We need nationally binding targets but we also need to look beyond that to what we do next.  This Government, like its predecessor, has been incredibly subservient to the unelected powers in Brussels and Frankfurt, enthusiastically embracing neoliberalism, privatisation, undermining public transport and so on.  All these issues contribute to climate change.  We, therefore, need more than targets - we need a new type of politics in Ireland, which has the foresight to put the good of society as the first benchmark rather than the profits of those who proclaim the benefits of the free market.  What free market, private individual will spend money on smart grids, light rail, citywide composting systems, building retrofits, visionary transit systems, and urban redesigns to stop us from spending half or our lives in traffic jams?  Private industry will not deliver the type of infrastructure that is necessary if we are to tackle climate change.  Ms Naomi Klein stated:<\/p><blockquote>The private sector is ill-suited to taking on most of these large infrastructure investments.  If the services are to be accessible, which they must be in order to be effective, the profit margins that attract private players simply aren&rsquo;t there.<\/blockquote><p>She gave examples from Paris where air pollution meant that the city banned cars for a day and so on.  We should have a free public transport system in reality to encourage people out of their cars.  The Government is doing the opposite.  The cost of transport has increased by more than 60% in the past five years, services are being cut, the rural train system of almost a century ago has been utterly decimated and initiatives that were put forward in the public good have been consumed by for-profit businesses.  That is damaging for everybody.<br\/><br\/>These amendments are important in salvaging something from the Bill.  The Government has allowed Ireland to be used as a laboratory in some ways whereby it is experimenting with treating the population as a national resource to be mined for cash, with wealth transferred from the many to the few and this just cannot go on.  Neoliberalism cannot tackle climate change.  We need a new way of doing things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000056#DDD00400","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443629700,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that Ireland will very much play its part in tackling climate change.

I am sure all sectors in the State will rise to the challenge and the national mitigation plan will be the vehicle for the delivery of progress in this area, utilising innovation, alternative energy, new technologies and new work practices.  It is only by deeply engaging with the sectors and the stakeholders that we will achieve sustainable progress through this plan, about which I am confident.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendments provide for the Minister to lay a range of reports in respect of domestic mitigation targets before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

It is just not good enough for a Government as strong as this to introduce legislation as weak as this.  It is only creating an appearance; it is an illusion; it is like a mirage.  The legislation needs teeth and the teeth that have been offered in the amendments by Deputies Wallace and Daly are calibrated and they demonstrate a measurable intent to do something.  They are not just wishful thinking or aspirational; they are calibrated.  Scotland has given us a working example of how this works.  Just because the EU has delivered watered down versions as a result of strong lobbying in these areas does not mean that we should accept proportional watering down.  If anything, we should add a little concentrate to this because, as previous speakers said, everything is joined up.  It is not only about the physics of the realities around us that apply; the financial obligations of the State and of companies to the people are related; and, therefore, they need to be defined, clear and reasonable.  That is what is proposed.  What are the Government parties afraid of?  They should not be afraid.<\/p>  <p>  In a few months, if not earlier, the Government parties will seek to secure a concrete number of seats.  They will aim at seats and they will not adopt a wishy, washy attitude of, \"We'll do our best\".  They will number crunch and they will give all their supporters targets.

That is due to the Government's inaction and refusal to do anything about it.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, we have a rent crisis.  That also comes down to the Government's inaction, it failure to do anything to address it, its failure to introduce a system of rent controls or rent certainty for clients and its steadfast refusal to increase rent allowance limits because it does not want artificially to inflate the market, as it has said, but yet it is quite happy to see people becoming homeless because their landlords have racked up the rent and they can no longer afford to pay it.  The Government is quite happy to pump money into the hotels around this city to house families while they are waiting for it to deal with the housing crisis that it has manufactured.  It has not taken any action to address this issue and that is the problem.  The plan the Minister announced in recent months, which will take years to initiate and which is all back-loaded in terms of funding, will not deal with the issues or the crisis.

If one heard that description in any other country, one would wonder what the hell was going on, were thousands of people dying or being imprisoned or tortured, but in a sense that is exactly what is going on.  If one meets people on the housing list - people whose children and their children are living with their mothers in houses - people who are struggling, with the support of high rent allowance or no rent allowance, to pay the high rent charged by the landlord, one will see that they are close to the edge, on a knife-edge or blade-edge, of living in terrible conditions and then they could find themselves out on the street.  That is how close it is.  Somebody used the analogy that if a family is in the middle-income category in America, that family is close to being impoverished.  The position in Ireland is that if one does not have a reasonable wage, if one cannot pay the rent or if one's landlord is overcharging, one is close to, and on, the edge.  The Simon Community was correct in what it said - this is a humanitarian crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Any Deputy or councillor worth his or her salt speaks to the people who come into their consistency offices and those people may start to cry, may be distressed or, sometimes, they may be suicidal and all for what but the constitutional right to own a house, or have a house or live in a home.  It is unacceptable and unimaginable that in 2015 the number of people on the housing list would climb.  The Minister can speak about five years of a recession but we must remember that the five years prior to that Ireland was regarded as one of the richest countries in the world and one of the most prosperous countries in Europe.  We are now at the stage where more than 100,000 of our citizens are homeless.  It is a humanitarian crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000058#FFF00800","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1443630300,"counter":962,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the debate and I will be strongly supporting the motion.  What I want most to happen as a result of this debate is for action to be taken to address the housing crisis.  For years we have seen under-investment in social housing.  We also have seen the reality that 5,000 people State-wide are living in emergency accommodation, with an estimated 2,298 people living in emergency accommodation in Dublin, 1,275 of whom are children, and an estimated 80 plus families present to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on a monthly basis.  This is the reality of what is happening an the ground.  We also have the situation of those who are homeless.  The number of homeless people sleeping rough has doubled.  The fourth aspect to this debate is the fact that families who are renting are being turfed out of the houses they are in because the landlords want to get them out or want to sell their houses.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to examine the proposals in this motion.  He needs to review Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000, with a view to amending legislation temporally in order to provide social housing in a more timely manner.  Second, he needs to increase the direct funding to local authorities to commence a long-term plan of social housing expansion.  Third, he needs to provide the legislative framework for local authorities to be able to access Housing Finance Agency loans off balance sheet.  These are very important issues.<\/p>  <p>  Another important issue that is often ignored is the fact that Dublin is full of empty plots and sites.  NAMA is creating a hyped up market in land.  This excludes the developers or builders and rewards the speculators.  A \"use it or lose it\" tax could be introduced to force the speculators to sell to the developers.  Also, a tax on land hoarding would bring down the price of land.  Those are some proposals in this area, and the Minister should have a look at them and get on with the job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000058#FFF00900","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1443630300,"counter":963,"content":"<p>The real tragedy of this emergency is that it was perfectly predictable.  The families who I have been meeting for the past two to three years, and not two to three months, have been struggling to find accommodation within the rent caps, which were way below market rents.  They are no different from other families.  They all find it impossible to comprehend that homelessness is something that can happen to them.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis has presented even further challenges to charities, which are trying to provide services for homeless people with more complex challenges.  They should not be entities that are criticised.  The problem is that we are back to making quick-fix solutions.  The one statistic that keeps cropping up is that there is a huge need for housing units to meet the needs of single people or couples, and at the same time there is a huge under-use of buildings that could be brought into use.  Initiatives on the fiscal side could potentially deliver some of that accommodation quickly and free up larger accommodation for families.  The financial contribution scheme, for example, was very popular in the Dublin city area and if that was replicated around the country, it would provide accommodation for older people, which would have the effect of freeing up houses for families.<\/p>  <p>  While there is nothing wrong with modular or system-built housing, it needs a two-staged approach.  For example, if accommodation is built near universities, it can then become student accommodation over time and it has a longer lifespan.  It does not mean that it is permanent accommodation for the people who are temporarily accommodated in it.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is that the housing assistance payment scheme will cause serious administrative problems for local authorities, but that has not even been thought about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000058#FFF01000","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1443630300,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate and generally support the motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The current crisis in social housing provision is as a direct result of the this and the previous Government's policy of effective privatisation of the sector, whereby responsibility for the provision housing for those in need of social housing has been transferred to the private sector to private landlords and subsided by the State.  I am dismayed and angry at the Government's response.  It is the same response we have seen for the past six or eight months.  It is like the child who has his or her finger stuck dyke trying to stop the water coming through.  The housing crisis is continuing to get worse.  We know the figures involved - 5,000 people Statewide are living in emergency accommodation and an estimated 2,298 people are living in emergency accommodation in Dublin.<\/p><p>Of these, 1,275 are children.  There are up to 130,000 people on the housing waiting lists.  Families are couch-surfing or sleeping in cars or, in the case of one family, sleeping in the Phoenix Park.  Yet in the first quarter of 2015, only 20 social housing units have been built and 187 voluntary housing units provided.  That is not dealing with the crisis.<br\/><br\/>The regulation of the private rental sector should include enhanced security of tenure.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 only provides for four years for security of tenure.  That should be raised to at least a minimum of ten years, possibly even 15 years.  That can be dealt with in one Bill either tomorrow or next week.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to address the right of a landlord to terminate a tenancy on the basis that the property is to be sold.  More families affected by this provision are attending our clinics every week.  It should be changed to simply give a right to a landlord, or to a bank which has repossessed rental accommodation, to sell the property with the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  This would not cost the Government any money and could be dealt with in legislation immediately.  The rent cap should be introduced for a minimum of two to three years, if the Government is not willing to go all the way with it.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has rightly called this a humanitarian crisis.  It should be described as a national emergency.  The Government should request the European Commission to allow it provide the moneys needed to deal with this humanitarian crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000058#FFF01100","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443630900,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Deputies Brendan Ryan, Jerry Buttimer, Anthony Lawlor, Michelle Mulherin, Arthur Spring, &Aacute;ine Collins, Dan Neville and Patrick O' Donovan will be sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000059#GGG00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1443630900,"counter":967,"content":"<p>We have a serious housing problem.  The root cause is simple, namely the lack of housing supply.  We are dealing with it through the Housing Strategy 2020.  When we emerged from the troika shackles and were first in a position to do so, we set out an ambitious housing strategy, costed at over &euro;3.8 billion.  We have begun to build social housing units again.  In Fingal County Council, local authority houses are again being built in Balbriggan, Balrothery, Lusk, Swords and Ballyboughal.  The number of void units in Fingal has been reduced from 201 in December 2013 to 28 as a result of Government funding.<\/p>  <p>  Some local authorities still have a problem with voids, however, which is unacceptable.  The planning process and building of homes does not happen overnight.  The lag between the announcement of funding and turning the key means we need other emergency measures.  The private rental market, as well as rent supplement, still has a role to play in solving this crisis.  There are calls from some in opposition and the non-governmental organisation, NGO, sector to raise the rent supplement threshold across the board.  I do not believe, however, this would solve the problem as it would serve to further inflate the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory discretionary power of community welfare officers to set an agreed rent over and above the rent supplement limit is an important tool in tackling the threat of homelessness resulting from rent increases.  Community welfare officers are using this discretion in Fingal when they can and it is helping to keep people in their homes.  It must be expanded to all areas.<\/p>  <p>  The real tool we need to combat extortionate rent increases is rent certainty.  This was a recommendation made by my colleagues and I on the Labour Party&rsquo;s housing committee.  It needs to be brought in urgently as it has been talked about for far too long.  It is immoral for a landlord to hike up rent without having to compare it to another measure such as the consumer price index.

I have confidence that with Labour in government we can and will solve this problem.  We need a strong, sensible and multifaceted approach.  What we do not need is what we have seen from Sinn F&eacute;in at local level.  Its councillors supported a full 15% reduction in the local property tax in Fingal County Council and other areas to the detriment of housing and homelessness budgets.  Neither do we need what we had in Fingal and other areas when councillors from People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance voted against the provision of social housing in Balrothery and Balbriggan.  Nor do we need anti-tax socialists crying crocodile tears about the housing crisis and then refusing to take responsibility to help when the opportunity presents itself.  We need every stakeholder and organisation, be they political party or approved housing agency, to pull together to deliver solutions.

It beggars belief as to why that money has not been drawn down.  In 2015, Cork County Council was allocated funding for 71 units and Cork City Council for 122 units.  In real terms, that is &euro;3.6 million but not one claim for a drawdown has been processed by the city.  That does not make sense to me.  Despite this, the councils have got 41 houses back into use, a development which I commend.  Cork County Council has got &euro;1.4 million, with a drawdown claim of over 30 units which the Department is processing.

No houses were delivered under that provision because of High Court cases taken by Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s friends, the builders and developers.  Since the crash, no houses have been delivered under the 20% rule.  It is amusing then to hear tonight that Fianna F&aacute;il is looking to bring the provision back, so as to assist its builder and developer friends.

As we all know, every Member accepts that there is an emergency social housing crisis, which is the result of years of underinvestment.  We know that one of the principal ways to address this crisis is to commence immediately a major social housing building programme, but the main reason this has not happened is quite obvious.  Five years ago this economy was bust and borrowing money at an unaffordable rate of 15%.  Admittedly, during the boom years, the previous Government could and should have done more to deal with this developing crisis but that did not happen.  As a result of this Government's goals and management of the economy, as a nation we can borrow money at a rate of just 1%.  This is the reason this Government is able to initiate a new building programme.  For the past two years, the Department has begun to find new projects through local authorities and voluntary housing associations.  It has also introduced the housing assistance payment scheme, which is far less cumbersome and more effective than the rent allowance scheme.  This Government is working hard to develop a rent certainty scheme, which must be constitutional first as well as being fair to the tenant and the landlord.  We need all sectors working together to solve this problem.<\/p>  <p>  We have a huge opportunity to regenerate our smaller towns and villages.  There are 130 ghost estates in Cork.  I am sure the people of Cork would be delighted if it was possible to work with the local authorities to get those estates viable and ready for families and homeless people as soon as possible by assisting the local authorities purchase and refurbish these houses.  This Government has begun the process.  The current improving state of the economy will ensure that progress can and will be successful over the medium to long term.  I welcome the announcement yesterday of the &euro;3 billion capital programme.  Short-term solutions must be found for the homeless and families who through no fault of their own are about to lose their homes.  To be really successful in dealing with the housing crisis, we need both the private and public sectors working together.  Many houses are needed not just for people who require social housing but also for families willing to rent or buy houses.

I wish to deal with a specific area, which is homelessness and people with serious mental health issues.  Our mental health is as important as our physical health and it is essential for Ireland's economic and social recovery.  Whether personally or through family, friends or colleagues, everyone is likely to be affected by mental health difficulties at some point in their lives.  The next Government must ensure people with mental health difficulties can be assessed for and have access to appropriate social housing with tenancy sustainment services in order to support their recovery.<\/p>  <p>  Between October 2012 and September 2013, every nine and a half days someone was discharged into homelessness from the Tallaght mental health service.  According to the Housing Agency, nationally 1,034 people with a mental health disability were on the housing lists nationally in 2013.  Those are the latest figures I could obtain.  Having a home is essential to maintaining one's mental health.  People using the mental health services should have access to appropriate social housing, if required, to support their recovery.  It is unfair and wrong that people, having been treated, are being discharged from mental health services into homelessness.  We must ensure there is an adequate supply of social housing places for people with a mental health disability in order to prevent homelessness and unnecessary long stays in hospital.  This may require allocating a number of new social housing units to people with a mental health disability.<\/p>  <p>  We must fund sustainable support for people with a mental health difficulty so that they can maintain their tenure, which will prevent homelessness.  We must ensure that rent supplement and the housing assistance payment is provided at a level that reflects the real cost of rental accommodation so that people with a mental health disability can have security of tenure.  We know the difficulties people with a mental illness already have in obtaining housing under a tenancy due to the stigma surrounding mental health, although this is a debate for another day.  The combination of official rent contribution increases and tight rent limits means that individuals in competitive rental markets such as Dublin are increasingly at the risk of homelessness.  For those with a mental health disability living in rented accommodation, the insecurity of tenure can lead to a deterioration in their mental health as can homelessness itself.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a higher prevalence of mental health illness among homeless people than there is in the general population.  They are also more likely to be alcoholics and suffer from drug dependency.  Some 20% to 25% of homeless people, compared to 6% of non-homeless people, have a severe mental illness.  Others estimate that up to one third of homeless people suffer from mental illness.<\/p>  <p>  Studies have found that there is a correlation between homelessness and incarceration in prison.  Those with a mental health illness or substance abuse problems are found to be incarcerated at a higher frequency than the general population.  Yesterday, I attended and was involved in the launch of a project to look at the level of mental illness in our prison population and young people.  A high proportion of our prison population has a mental health challenge.  Some 65% of people in prison have a mental health challenge and a further 35% have an intellectual disability.  It is unclear how many people within the prison population have both a mental health challenge and an intellectual disability.  This is an area that is rarely debated in relation to homelessness but a very serious one none the less.  The project, which is based mainly in Ireland and is supported by Trinity College, Dublin and internationally, was launched in the European Parliament yesterday.  It is important that this research is supported.  We hope the project gets the required support and funding, both nationally and within Europe.

Voluntary agencies do a great job in general.  In particular, they look after special housing needs and sheltered housing better than anybody else and much better than local authorities can.  Of course, this was a great opportunity for the Government of the day, which will remain nameless, to wash its hands of responsibility and to hand it over to the private rental market.  There was no housing policy, no plan and no provision for the future.  All that was done from time to time was a count of the number of people on the various housing lists.  They were then counted again, after which people said there were a few things wrong with the application forms and some of the people should be struck off because they were not really in need of a house.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime it became more obvious that the Department of Social Protection was supposed to fill the housing void and provide the funding over a prolonged period to pay for the houses that the applicants for local authority houses required.  Housing policy was handed over to the Department of Social Protection, much to the annoyance of that Department and the various Ministers in the intervening period.  It was an appalling disaster and we are now reaping the whirlwind.<\/p>  <p>  Some Members of this House have said in the last couple of weeks that this is a crisis which has only become obvious now and that the Government should have done something about it.  Four and a half years ago was way too late to have done something about it, and if any Member of the House thinks that a problem of this nature can be resolved in six weeks, six months or six years for that matter, they are wrong.  It requires emergency measures in the first instance and a long-term plan.  In fairness to the Government, it has introduced a plan.  It might not be sufficient to meet the requirements that are now envisaged by the Opposition, but it was introduced by the Government.  Nothing had been done previously.  Previously, the issue was postponed from next week to next year to thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The problem now is that there is an urgent need to deal with the immediate emerging problem of homelessness, which is caused by a shortage of supply.  That is strange when one considers that we had a housing boom just a few years ago and Members of this House were talking about demolishing houses all over the country, saying bulldozers should be used and so forth - so much for that plan and for their insight into the future.  The Government's policy is correct.  We need emergency housing in the first instance and we need it quickly.  We must recognise that people cannot exist without a home.<\/p>  <p>  The last point I wish to make is important.  I have listened to people over a number of years expound the theory that Irish people have a predilection towards ownership of their houses which they should not have.  We have all heard this debated many times.  Why should they not have it?  We have a right to own our houses.  In particular, it is important that the householder has an opportunity to pay his own mortgage as opposed to the landlord's mortgage.  I do not see the merit in paying somebody else's mortgage if it costs the same to pay one's own.<\/p>  <p>  There is another issue, which we have inherited from our history.  We have a feeling that we should own our own house.  That is built into every person in this country.  It has a benefit.  The benefit is that the person has an investment, something they wish to retain, improve and work for.  They have an incentive to do what they wish to do for themselves and to provide for themselves, and they will do it.<\/p>  <p>  Another point I wish to raise has also been raised by other Members.  Where have the local authority loans gone?  Every effort was made to squeeze them out of the system, and that has succeeded to a great extent.  It is virtually impossible to qualify for a local authority loan.  The nonsense that takes place to assess a person is laughable.  For a ten year period it was made impossible for people in that income bracket to qualify for a loan and they were squeezed out of the market.  As they were squeezed out of the market, they became more vulnerable.  We should look again at the local authority loans fund with a view to ensuring that it is re-opened.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, under the 1966 Act the local authorities have a function in respect of housing.  They have a two-pronged system whereby they build houses with the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or they offer loans to people who wish to build their own house.  An earlier speaker already referred to the possibility of private sites.  This was very successful in many schemes throughout the country.  There was great work where people in the relevant income bracket built their own homes.  They simply had to qualify under the local authority guidelines and they were able to build their own house on a serviced site.  It was an excellent provision.<\/p>  <p>  All of those things happened in the recent past.  They were all well capable of being resolved satisfactorily.  If they had been addressed, planned for and if provision had been made for them, we would not be in the current position.  There would have been an adequate number of houses.  A local authority, such as the one of which I was previously a member, must provide 800 houses per annum, either by loan or by direct build.  That is the way it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000061#JJJ00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1443632100,"counter":987,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on an issue that affects all constituencies.  It is not just an urban issue, but affects every town and village in the country.  People want to hear about possible solutions as well as a plan for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned something in the House on a number of occasions and I urge the Minister to examine it.  In the city of Dublin, within walking distance of this Chamber, there is a university with approximately 16,500 students.  I do not have a copy of the register of electors for Nassau Street, Molesworth Street, Kildare Street, Grafton Street and O'Connell Street, but I presume very few people live in those streets now compared to the number that lived there 40 or 50 years ago.  If we have building stock in urban, town and village areas that is vacant, is there something we can do to incentivise the people who own these properties to put them to use for people who need to be housed?  Of course, there is.  As I have said previously, it can be done through an examination of the system of commercial rates and the incentivisation of people to upgrade their existing facilities and convert them into units in which people could be housed comfortably and safely in a modern facility.<\/p>  <p>  There is no need to go 15 and 20 miles from the heart of a large urban centre such as Dublin, Limerick, Cork or Galway to try and solve this problem.  Around the world large urban centres such as Amsterdam and Paris are living cities.  We have cities in which nobody lives.  There are thousands of empty units throughout Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, but no plan to address that.  At the same time, Dublin City Council, for example, is reducing the local property tax by 15%, costing approximately &euro;11 million.  That &euro;11 million will be taken directly out of services.  South Dublin County Council will take out &euro;5 million.  One could house a large number of people with those amounts.  The Government will take its share of responsibility but county and city councils throughout the country do not have Part 8 provisions ready, do not have sites ready, have not sought planning permission and have no idea where they would put houses if they won the lotto, for want of a better word, and received all of the money they required tomorrow morning.  They have no plans in place.  The reason is, as Deputy Durkan said, that this problem has been sat on for a generation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and other Deputies will be aware that not a single rural house has been built by local authorities for probably more than a decade.<\/p><p>It is said there is no housing problem outside the 50 km\/h speed limit zones in parts of this country, which, of course, is not the case.  There are sons and daughters of farmers in smallholdings in the west and south who simply cannot afford to build a house.  As Deputy Durkan said, they bring a site to the table.  In previous years, the local authority would have financed the construction of a house but those people are now on the same housing list as tens of thousands of others because they cannot access loans because the conditions attaching are so onerous.<\/p> <p> There are things that can be done, although I am not for one minute saying there is a panacea.  There are problems in regard to housing repairs for elderly people and the situation relating to voids is scandalous.  No wonder this is the case if there is a city council that can take &euro;11 million from its budget because it says it does not need it while at the same time it has hundreds - if not thousands - of units that need to be upgraded in order to be let.  There is a question of morality.  If a local authority such as Dublin City Council can afford to take &euro;11 million from its budget while having thousands of people on its housing waiting lists, then the councillors who voted for this need to take a look at themselves and ask if this is the appropriate use of resources.  I do not believe it is.  They should have taken that &euro;11 million and, within four weeks, tried to find how many of those void units could house families.<\/p> <p> We have all experienced this issue as public representatives.  A huge number of people are offered local authority houses and refuse them.  They have no choice but to the refuse them because, in many cases, the houses are in areas that are blighted by antisocial behaviour.  Local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have failed tenants in those local authority housing estates for years by not looking after them.  If we are going to have a discussion in regard to local authority housing and social housing, we need to include the existing tenants who, in many cases, have been abandoned by local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Durkan said, what we need is a long-term plan.  We do not need falsities and pipedreams.  We need a short-term programme in the context of modular housing and emergency accommodation.  However, as Deputy McDonald will know, NAMA offered 5,753 properties to local authorities and only 1,068 of them were taken up, which shows there is a deep-rooted problem in local authorities when it comes to the housing crisis.  It is not just the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000061#JJJ00300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443632700,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Pearse Doherty, who is sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, &Oacute; Snodaigh, McDonald, Stanley and Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000062#KKK00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1443632700,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I listened to the debate earlier and it is very clear who is to blame.  It is every single local authority in the State, it is every single county manager and city manager and it is the councillors who sit there.  The Government has provided everything but, somehow, all of these local authorities have colluded to make sure that no houses are built and no houses which are currently not fit for purpose are being repaired.  For some reason, they have done all of that with the support of local authority members.  It is simply unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  I would agree with one aspect - and one aspect only - of what I have heard in the last while from the Government spokespersons, namely, there is no quick-fix solution to this crisis.  This crisis will take time to resolve.  However, there are things that can be done immediately that will help to solve the situation we are in.  We have heard from the Government backbenchers about there being no quick-fix solutions.  It is as if they came to office just yesterday when they are in their fifth year of Government.<\/p>  <p>  This is a crisis that did not happen overnight.  We did not all wake up one morning and find there were thousands of people homeless and hundreds living on our streets.  It did not happen overnight.  It was pointed out time and again by agencies and by people working at the coal face in dealing with these issues that this was going to happen.  At budget time every year, when I talk about those who are homeless, I have stated that the budget measures the Government has brought in will make the situation worse.  It is very clear that the policy of this Government is to accept the fact of homelessness.  It cannot cut capital spending in the way it has done and pretend there would be no homeless crisis.  The Government parties went into this with their eyes wide open.<\/p>  <p>  The Government talks about a six-year plan of &euro;3.8 billion to try to resolve some of this problem, although it will only house a third of those who are currently on the waiting list.  I recall one of the first decisions the Government made when it entered office.  It was made on 31 March 2011 - the Government did not need a six-year plan then.  It was on just one day that it handed over &euro;3.1 billion to the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank, to the poor craters who invested in the broken bank and got paid 100% by the Government.  Yet, the Government cannot scrounge up enough money to deal with the crisis that has been happening on its watch for the past number of years and prior to its entry into office.  The fact is that the Government has been tolerating homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  There are things that the Government can do.  As finance spokesperson, I see it all the time in terms of how the Government has bowed down to the banks, how it has allowed the banks to evict people from their houses time and again and how it has weakened the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  In recent weeks the Supreme Court ruled that it need only take one part of that code of conduct into account when dealing with repossessions, that is, the fact that there cannot be repossessions within the moratorium period.  When I brought forward legislation in this House to put the code of conduct on a statutory basis, however, the Government said it was not needed because the code was sufficiently robust.  Again, Sinn F&eacute;in has been proven correct.<\/p>  <p>  The homelessness crisis and the housing crisis can be ended.  However, politics is all about choices.  In the last budget the Government decided to put more money into the pockets of the wealthiest people.  At the same time, some Government Deputies, when they come to Dublin, spend the night in hotels where families are now being accommodated.  They are aware of the pain and the suffering this is causing those families, and some Members have told very humane stories about how it affects children and will affect children well past the time when all of us have left this Chamber in years to come.  It is scandalous that they cannot find within themselves the means to declare this a national emergency.  When it is declared a national emergency, we can do different things.  We can make sure the funding is found; we can make sure that the NAMA properties are used.<\/p>  <p>  This is the despicable thing.  The State owns thousands of houses right across the country but, as the Taoiseach has said, NAMA is there to make a profit.  Of course NAMA is there to make a profit; that is why it was set up.  However, we can change the law under which NAMA is governed if we so wish and if we desire to end this crisis.  Instead of selling those houses to speculators, we can decide to take them into our ownership and provide them for social housing and the needs of the homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000062#KKK00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1443632700,"counter":991,"content":"<p>One hundred and thirty thousand citizens across this State are in need of a home, representing an alarming increase of 40,000 from four years ago.  That is the Government record.  It is estimated there are now 5,000 people, including over 1,000 children, homeless and living in emergency accommodation in this country.  Focus Ireland is reporting that homelessness in Ireland has increased by a staggering 76% since January.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the Dublin Simon Community recently referred to this horrendous situation as a \"humanitarian crisis\".<\/p>  <p>  This is not an issue that is exclusive to Dublin, however; it is a national emergency.  My constituency office is visited every day by people who are at their wit's end waiting to be housed.  Some of these people have been on housing waiting lists for years and they are clearly at breaking point.  It was recently revealed that there are 28 vacant council houses available in my home county of Monaghan.  It beggars belief and defies logic that these houses are lying idle when there are over 1,300 applicants - individuals and families - on housing waiting lists across the county.  In the neighbouring county at the other end of the constituency, County Cavan, there are 68 vacant council houses and approximately 1,146 applicants on the waiting list for social housing.<\/p><p>In that county, there has been a decrease of &euro;148,467 in the provision for refurbishment funding from 2014 to the current year, 2015.  People are on their knees, but it is clear the Government is blind to the reality facing so many vulnerable individuals and families.  All we hear time and again is talk of the so-called &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; and &ldquo;stability&rdquo;, but the reality is that many of Ireland&rsquo;s families are not feeling any recovery.<\/p> <p> The Government's housing policy thus far has been nothing short of abysmal.  Social housing provision has been grossly neglected, with years of little or no investment.  A vigorous social housing construction programme must be a priority.  Spiralling rent costs must also be tackled.  For families on rent allowance or those on low incomes, it is simply not possible to meet the demand of increasing rents.  Therefore, we are calling for an immediate increase in rent supplement and the housing assistance payment.  Similarly, legislation is also needed to protect tenants in the private rental sector to ensure they have greater rent certainty and increased security of tenure.<\/p> <p> People are on their knees and it is imperative that this crisis is dealt with effectively and as speedily as possible.  Urgent and adequate action is needed to address the issue to ensure there is housing for all who need it.  People have a right to housing, to somewhere they can call \"home\".  Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined a number of additional measures geared towards tackling this national emergency which would be more properly referred to as a national disgrace.  In the interests of all those currently homeless or in danger of losing their homes, we hope all parties in the D&aacute;il will support our motion.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister of State to consider withdrawing the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000062#KKK00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443633300,"counter":993,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Ellis a chur an r&uacute;n seo os comhair na D&aacute;la ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id seo.

The Government is in place four and a half years, yet we have not seen any action taken that has had an effect on housing waiting lists or on homelessness in this and other cities.  The opposite has happened.  Any effect the Government has had since coming to power has been negative and now we have a greater housing list than ever before.  We have an increased number of rough sleepers, in Dublin in particular.  I know about Dublin, but other Deputies could speak for their cities.<\/p>  <p>  Men and women do not choose to sleep on the street in winter or summer for the fun of it.  Sleeping on the street is a cry for help because they have no alternative.  If nothing else, I wish that this message got through the thick skulls of Government Members sitting here day in day out without taking action.  I have heard statements from the Government saying it will look into the matter.  They have been looking far too long at this issue.  I heard the claptrap from Deputy Patrick O'Donovan when he spoke about a long-term plan.  The problem with the Government is that it has long fingered every plan and action that should have been taken from day one.  Some of the plans and actions that should have been taken were cost neutral.  Simple steps that could have been taken were not taken, although they might have helped.<\/p>  <p>  The Government could have taken simple steps, such as ensuring local authorities had a quicker turnaround in terms of their voids.  It could also have taken steps like the proposals mentioned in our motion.  The current and previous Governments have not taken simple decisions.  This has meant that the regeneration of parts of my and other areas have never gone ahead.  This is not just about sites that are shovel ready, as Deputy O'Donovan proposed.  There are a number of sites in places like Ballyfermot where planning permission was given previously, but these sites are sitting idle.  There has been no movement on them since the current Government came to power and since the previous Government made a hames of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Look, for example, at St. Michael's Estate, Cherry Orchard and the likes of Cornamona, where there was a senior citizens' development but it has been knocked down.  It is a serviced site and a developer could begin on that site in the morning.  Look at a site under the control of the Government - it is an OPW site - in Inchicore.  Planning permission was granted for 200 houses on that site, but the builder's business collapsed.  That should not stop the State stepping in and going ahead with those buildings.  Another site in the locality was earmarked for housing and the owners applied for planning permission, but the HSE bought the site and intends to use it as a builders' depot for the children's hospital, a laudable project.<\/p>  <p>  In my area and other areas of our cities there are sites, houses, homes and buildings which could be easily converted at cost and made available for those on the housing lists.  If we walk around this neighbourhood day or night, but particularly at night, we will see people sleeping in doorways.  Sleeping rough is now at a level I have never seen before.  This is a national crisis.  The Government should recognise this, because when it came into power, it produced emergency measures to deal with banking and other issues.  However, it never addressed the human or humanitarian crisis.  It never produced emergency legislation to deal with a rent cap on private rented accommodation or to purchase compulsorily or acquire property suitable to address homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  This is madness.  It is long past the time for words.  We need action and if the Government is not willing to take action, its members should get out of their seats and let somebody else take the action that is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000063#LLL00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1443633300,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Nothing means more to any parent than the welfare of his or her children.  We all want to do the best for them, to care for them and give them the stability they need from the moment they are born.  We want to give them the start in life they deserve.  That cocoon of comfort, care and stability is not a reality for all children.  Homeless children are traumatised on a daily basis at a time when they are at their most vulnerable.  Their formative years are being lost to this man-made crisis.<\/p>  <p>  It has been nothing less than harrowing to listen to this debate, knowing that real people lie behind the stories and statistics.  Homelessness touches not just those without a roof over their heads, but those who come into contact with them and none more so than those at the front line of the homelessness crisis, the people who face this reality on a daily basis.  Let me tell the Minister of State of the experiences of a primary school teacher in my constituency and about how the plight of Dublin's homeless children has impacted on her, on her school and on the young children attending that school.  I cannot overstate the great sense of frustration she feels knowing that nothing is being done for these children or for what seems to her as the hopelessness of her position and these children while she and her fellow teachers try to cope with what seems at times like a tidal wave of despair.<\/p>  <p>  In her school of 345 pupils, 5% of the children are homeless, 17 primary school children in one Dublin school.  These young citizens in their formative years should have stability in their young lives, be doing their homework in a secure environment, be playing and developing friendships.  Instead, these children face problems that any adult would have difficulty coping with.  These homeless children live in hotels, guest houses and B&amp;Bs.  The really unlucky ones have been known to sleep in parks in our city and in cars.  Like with the old tenements, many families occupy a single room.  The children have nowhere to play, they cannot call for their friends and there is no space for toys.  Most toys had to be dumped when families lost their homes.<\/p><p>There may be no room for toys because the family's whole life, its worldly possessions, are contained in the bags it carries with it day to day.  The homeless child cannot do the normal childish things, like running around and playing or messing, because if he or she does, the hotel might decide he or she cannot stay.  Teachers tell me stories of mothers trying to wash the school jumpers in the hotel bath and drying them in the room, as a consequence making everything damp.  There are no washing facilities.  There are no cooking facilities in the hotel or bed and breakfast either.  The possession of a toaster or microwave could lead to the family being thrown out of its accommodation.  Families live on cheap takeaways because they cannot cook for themselves.<\/p> <p> All the while, the children worry because they know how precarious their position is.  They are tired when they get to school because it is very hard to get a decent night's sleep sharing a room with one's whole family.  Their schooling is disrupted.  They often arrive late for school because their hotel or bed and breakfast is so far away.  They are perpetually insecure and many of them are perpetually on the move.<\/p> <p> All of us know how important school is for any child.  For the homeless child, it is often the one constant in his or her very disrupted life.  We know it is getting harder to find accommodation for families.  We know that hotels do not want any more homeless people staying in them and that the idea of \"self accommodating\" is just not working. <\/p> <p> Picture this - parents making the rounds of hotels, begging for a room at the inn for themselves and their family.  How degrading and utterly humiliating for any parent and how deeply shameful that any child would witness this.  The children are worried and anxious and they feel hopeless.  They cannot do anything to help.  They see the stress and pressure on their parents and see their desperation.  They are experiencing a life no child in Ireland, in any civilised country or modern European economy should ever have to experience.<\/p> <p> This is not a crisis; it is a catastrophe.  The plight of homeless children in modern Ireland is a tragedy.  Is it going to take a greater tragedy for the Government to act?  It will not acknowledge this.  May I ask the Minister of State, what is his benchmark for a \"crisis\"?  What greater crisis could any country have than to have its young children sleeping on the streets?<\/p> <p> I for one am fed up of the Government's finger-pointing and bleating.  It is no good to these children.  We need a plan and immediate action.  I note that none of the Minister of State's colleagues from Fine Gael or the Labour Party are here.  What a terrible pity.  They need to engage with this issue and do the right thing by these homeless children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000063#LLL00300","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443633900,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the catastrophe which Deputy McDonald has just outlined.  A number of times earlier this year, the Government made a big play of addressing the housing issue.  I received its capital investment plan but there is nothing new in it on housing and dealing with this important issue.  The figures we have seen will only deal with a tiny percentage of those who are on the waiting list and would benefit from the new houses that are coming on-stream.  While all new houses are welcome, not enough is being done.<\/p>  <p>  If it was in Government, Sinn F&eacute;in would increase the availability of funding for the local authorities to ensure that long-term solutions are put in place for social housing.  The legislation that went through the House before the summer break, which reduced the social housing contribution under Part V in private housing developments, baffled me.  I was chair of a housing strategic policy committee, SPC, when that was in operation.  Although it was not a silver bullet, it was certainly part of the solution.  In the case of County Laois, we were getting 18% of all new builds.  They were being bought by the council, not given to them.  There was a level of success there.  It could have been improved on and not everything was done right, yet I would say it was 80% or 90% successful, which is better than 0%.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of vacant sites, I proposed a Bill earlier in the year and outlined the need for derelict sights to be utilised and for developers and those who are sitting on sites to either use them or lose them.  There are 123 such sites in the county.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have available, I want to outline a few figures for the Minister of State.  NAMA has made 6,500 residential properties available for social housing, according to my information and has made that known to the Minister of State's Department and to the councils.  However, it has only confirmed demand for 2,500.  There are only 1,500 already tenanted.  There is obviously a logjam and I would like to know what is happening.  This is an issue I have banged on about in the past and will again.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is holding up voids as being the solution.  They are a solution.  Looking at the list of voids, County Roscommon, with a small council, has 113 houses empty.  County Mayo has 145 while in the case of County Laois, there are only four voids out of over 2,000 properties.  There would be four houses empty any week, anywhere.  The private sector would not have as good a record as that.  The voids are not being left empty in County Laois.  In the case of County Kildare, there are 39 out of a bigger housing stock, which is not massive.  Work is being done filling the voids.  We do not want to blame the local authorities for all of this either.<\/p>  <p>  There are in the region of 7,000 households on the waiting list in County Kildare.  In the case of County Laois, a much smaller county, there are 1,773 on the waiting list.  Going by areas, there are 367 seeking housing in Mountmellick; 419 in Portarlington; and 1,150 in Portlaoise.  In the town of Monasterevin in south Kildare, there are 536 households seeking housing and not a social house has been built in that area for over 20 years.  The figures are astronomical.  <\/p>  <p>  Focusing on solutions, the Government always asks what the Opposition has put forward.  We put forward 22 separate measures to solve the problems.  I will not read them all out but there are a few which I will highlight.  They include: increasing funding to local authorities; reversing the prioritisation of State-subsidised private rented accommodation, its effective privatisation, through the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS and social leasing; bringing this to the attention of the European Commission and have it declared a national emergency; and capping.  This needs to be done and I know the Minister, Deputy Kelly, keeps talking about it.  For God's sake, he should go and do it.  The issue of NAMA needs to be addressed and the Government needs to set up municipal trusts so that money can be borrowed by local authorities off balance sheet to fund houses.  The Minister should restore Part V to 20% and bring the legislation to the House in order to do that.  We should also examine the feasibility of a rural resettlement scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000064#MMM00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1443633900,"counter":997,"content":"<p>It is good to see the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has joined us - &quot;Angry Alan&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000064#MMM00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1443633900,"counter":998,"content":"<p>Happy P&aacute;draig.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000064#MMM00400","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1443633900,"counter":999,"content":"<p>He is angry at people who say they are not going to pay for their water.

What makes me angry is that we paid huge amounts of money to developers for turn-key housing at the top of the market, and although the Minister's Government inherited an opportunity to get a very good deal for the taxpayer by purchasing blocks of housing at the bottom of the market, it sat on its hands and let the opportunity pass.<\/p><p>What makes me angry is the fact that there are people working in this city earning a decent wage who cannot afford to pay their rent because rents are going through the roof.  It makes me angry that the Minister, who is deputy leader of the Labour Party and sitting in a Chamber with a statue of James Connolly, cannot find it in his heart to take on the vested interests who put up rents in the city and all across the State.  I am angry that he cannot confront greed and defend young people and young families who need to put a roof over their heads.  I cannot understand how this crisis continues year after year.  I have come to the view that it is now a policy, a decision of the Government to leave the market to itself while talking about capital plans and five-year investments.  In reality, there is very little more on the table than would have been on it in the first place.<\/p> <p> What is the Minister going to do about it?  What is his strategy?  What is the Government to do for my county, where almost 200 council houses and a very significant number of private sector houses are empty?  There are almost 3,000 on the housing list.  They are ordinary people.  Sometimes the best wisdom is derived from speaking to everyday people.  They ask me how there can be so many empty houses across County Donegal.  They ask why the Government does not pull the banks and NAMA together and why there is no strategy to ensure the houses are accessed and that people will have a chance to have a roof over their heads.  Why can the Government not ensure that people pay a reasonable rent reflecting what they earn in this city and across the State?  How come the Government allocates the housing assistance payment or rent supplement at a level that means people have to find hundreds of extra euro to pay their rent?  One will never get a house for the amount of money the Government allocates to people.  It tells people it has given them housing assistance and rent supplement and is doing all of that but the reality, which the Minister knows, is that in any town or city across the State, the amount of money allocated does not reflect the rental values.  If one goes to the local estate agent to find a property, one will need to pay hundreds of euro more than one is receiving if one is to rent it.<\/p> <p> I say to \"Angry Alan\" that it is time to really find the right people to get angry with.  It is time to have a strategy.  It is time to go back to what his party is supposed to be about.  He has only got a few months to save his bacon.

There were some very constructive contributions and others that were not so constructive.  There is no doubt that this issue extends beyond party politics.  We all need to work towards solutions and that is what our people expect and need.<\/p>  <p>  I assure all the Members that the Minister and I are absolutely committed to dealing with housing.  Only today, we met all local authority chief executives and directors of housing from all around the country to discuss their plans and ensure solid progress will be made on the implementation of the social housing strategy.  We must remember that the local government sector comprises the housing authorities, and they have assured us that they are absolutely committed to delivering on the targets they have been set.  These targets concern the projects they themselves submitted to us for approval.  These projects have been approved.  They are shovel ready in every local authority area in the country.<\/p>  <p>  In the relatively short period I have to conclude the Government's contribution to this debate, I will try to focus on the key issues that arose during the Members' contributions over the past two evenings.  With regard to homelessness, in the short term while housing supply is being ramped up and while the modular housing and other proposals are being developed further, a range of measures is being implemented to address the current homelessness issue and prevent further cases from arising.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to tenancy protection, the tenancy sustainment protocol, operating in conjunction with Threshold in the Dublin and Cork city areas, continues to provide supports to persons in urban areas where supply problems are most acute.  Over 1,200 of the 4,000 cases dealt with were supported with increased rent supplement limits on a case-by-case basis.  Plans are actively under way to extend this protocol to Galway city, and officials from the Department of Social Protection are engaging on this with the council in Galway and Threshold.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the allocation of local authority tenancies, the ministerial direction issued by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, which requires local authorities to prioritise the homeless and vulnerable householders in the allocation of tenancies under their control, has been extended and will apply until 31 January 2016.  A high-level task force on social housing and homelessness, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, meets weekly to oversee the identification and delivery of properties to accommodate homeless families in the Dublin region.  This process has overseen the delivery of a NAMA property recently, an apartment block in south Dublin that is now operating as a 65-unit homelessness facility with a single assessment centre for the homeless families.  The acquisition of approximately 100 units, which will be ring-fenced for homeless households, is currently in progress.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the local authority housing programme, I have already said and repeated today to the chief executives that the funding has been allocated.  The project proposals submitted by the local authorities in all areas have been approved, but now we need to see them delivered.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with speakers on boarded-up units in local authority ownership.  It is not acceptable that they lie vacant when funding is being made available for them.  I acknowledge that in the past, local authorities did not have the funding to do up the vacant units and bring them back into beneficial use.  The required funding is now being provided and the chief executive officers of the local authorities are now committed to eradicating the voids in their jurisdictions, which voids have been referred to by many Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  A significant programme of returning void local authority units to productive use is now in operation nationally and specifically in the Dublin City Council area, where approximately 500 units have been brought back into use to date this year.  A further 180 projects are in progress and another 257 are planned.  Over 2,300 void units were brought back into use last year.  Funding for approximately 2,500 units is in place for 2015.  Therefore, it is not fair to say there is no action on voids.  The record speaks for itself.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies might want to double-check their figures on voids because the picture painted today by the chief executives of the authorities offers a completely different perspective from theirs.  There is a challenge for all of us.  Local authorities are being funded.  We said to them specifically today that if they have more voids that need funding, they will get it.  I encourage Deputies to ask the chief executive officers and their local authorities to make their submissions.  We are considering how we can streamline and shorten the local authority project delivery process.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding what NAMA can deliver, 1,400 houses and apartments were delivered to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing use, and they are on track to deliver 4,500 new residential units in the greater Dublin area by the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  There is much more I would like to say but I am constrained by the time limits.  The Government is determined to deal with this crisis.  As with everybody else, we understand the challenges that families face.  We are representative of the very same families as the Deputies opposite.  It behoves all of us, including the Opposition, Government, local authorities, councillors and society in general, to respond to this crisis in a proactive way because the people who need the houses are depending on us to deliver them.  We will do all in our power to provide the funding but we need local authorities, approved housing bodies and everybody to get behind the effort to ensure we deliver the houses the people so badly need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000065#NNN00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1443634500,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>To be honest, what the Minister of State just said does not reflect the reality on the ground.

I know very well the effects of homelessness and the Minister knows the reasons why.  It affects my family directly and I have spoken about that in the past.  The responses I got from some of the Minister's own party colleagues go to show that it is not just he who is arrogant.  The whole Labour Party is arrogant when it comes to homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  In the time left, I want to talk briefly about some of the solutions.  There are solutions which the Minister could implement immediately.  I have a particular interest in drug addiction when it comes to homelessness.  One of the biggest issues for recovering addicts is that when they come out of rehab they do not have step-down facilities.  They are being forced back into homeless hostels where drug use is rampant in many cases.  That is not the environment into which we should put people who are trying to beat addiction.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, some people on the methadone programme may be getting their methadone administered through a homeless hostel.  Last week, I met one young girl in an accident and emergency department who, for whatever reason, had a falling out with a particular hostel.  It should be remembered that we are dealing with people who have chronic addiction and mental health issues.  As she was asked to leave the hostel, she slept that night in a multi-storey car park and missed her methadone that day.<\/p>  <p>  The following day she went to the accident and emergency department in Cork to try to get some methadone.  However, due to the delays in our health service and because they would not administer methadone until she had a psychological evaluation and had spoken to a psychiatrist, she missed her methadone for a second day.  Anyone who knows anything about addiction will know that if someone does not take their methadone for 48 hours they have to go back to a 20 millilitre dose.  This young girl was on 70 millilitres at the time.  However, because of a policy failure which forced this girl back on to the streets, she could not access methadone and had to start again at 20 millilitres, which was insufficient.  Her only solution, rightly or wrongly, was to go back out and start using heroin again.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  Over 50% of people on our housing lists are single persons.  They have no hope of being housed under the Minister's social housing building programme.  He is talking about houses for families, which is all well and good, but not every homeless person is part of a family.  There are individuals with mental health issues, drug addiction and other social issues that prevent them from independent living.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been talking recently about how we are going to solve the crisis by building 150 modular houses.  That is great.  The 150 houses will cater for those who will become homeless this month and next month, but no one else will benefit.  The Minister says it is an interim measure but unfortunately I do not believe that.  Direct provision was supposed to be an interim measure, as was housing people in hostels and hotels, yet they are now becoming permanent measures.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about the RAS and HAP schemes as solutions.  I do not know what it is like in the Minister's county council in Tipperary, but I know what is happening in Cork City Council.  People come to my constituency office asking to get out of RAS because it is not working for them.  They are in sub-standard accommodation.  That is the reality.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not want to eat into Deputy Ellis's time because I know he wants to conclude the debate.  I will therefore finish on this point.  The Minister is right to say that we all have to work together, but we can only do so if the Minister is willing to sit down and listen to people like us and Fr. Peter McVerry, and not criticise us.  The Minister should not say he has all the solutions while we do not have any.  We have solutions and we need to implement them.  The first thing the Minister should do is declare a national emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000066#OOO02700","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1443635100,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate.

Volunteers who deliver meals, hot drinks, clothes and other supports have bailed out this Government, as well as the previous one, by their duty.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the Minister's amendment and his response to our Private Member's Bill that he and his Government colleagues are failing to recognise the extent and depth of this crisis.  He talks about this crisis using the language of the business world, with an emphasis on Ireland's competitiveness.  A more humane approach in his analysis is needed, however, given the extent to which homelessness affects the lives of so many people - men, women and particularly children.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has conceded that this crisis is a humanitarian one, yet there was little of that sentiment in his response to the opening debate on this motion yesterday evening.  He has listened as speaker after speaker called on him to take action in elevating the status of this situation to what is fundamentally needed, which is the declaration of an emergency.  In the Minister's speech on this debate yesterday evening there was a complete absence of any reference to our proposal to liaise with the European Commission in declaring an emergency.  Over three years ago, the Government announced that it would end homelessness by 2016 but the Minister has failed in this and the Government has repeatedly failed to tackle the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  When Jonathan Corrie died last Christmas, the Minister pulled together housing bodies, local authority CEOs, charity groups and politicians for an emergency meeting from which he emerged claiming to have worked out an effective response to the crisis.  In this he has failed miserably, however.  It is also true that far from ending the crisis, the number of people sleeping rough on the streets nightly has doubled to 130 since Jonathan Corrie's death - a stark reality compounded by the death of another homeless person near Leinster House last week.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to point to the Minister's current allocation of &euro;493 million so far this year to local authorities and housing bodies to construct just 2,900 units.  This level of provision is totally inadequate and is far from ambitious.  It is clear that given only an average of 400 social housing units have been delivered annually for the last three years, the Minister's entire strategy hinges on the private sector delivering further rental and leasing agreements, with a transition to HAP.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The voluntary housing bodies are delivering more due to their ability to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency in addition to other financial institutions.  This tells us that the plan the Minister announced a year ago for a six-year programme with investment of &euro;3.8 billion in total - &euro;2.5 billion for the first three years and &euro;1.3 billion for the remaining three - is not delivering.  The first year of the programme is already over and there is little evidence to support claims of any great success in social housing provision.  Our Bill proposes the renewal of the financial contribution scheme for senior citizens, which would provide a significant contribution to be retained and ring-fenced for future social housing.  I call on the Minister to reinstate this scheme.  <\/p> <p> We acknowledge benefits around elements of the Urban Regeneration Bill introduced earlier this year, particularly around ending get-out clauses for developers.  However, we call on the Government to restore the original 20% for social and affordable housing under Part V in order to bring the position here into line with other European countries.  We see this as an appeasement of the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues and developers in general.  Local authority senior management seems have limited its remit to the operation of social housing lists and in general terms, moving away from the issue of social housing delivery itself.  Does the Minister believe that the ideological persuasions of some chief executives and senior management could have an influence on this shift of focus?  Does he see them as a block or hindrance to the delivery of social housing?  If so, what will he do?<\/p> <p> Regarding the role of NAMA, we welcome the conversion of office, retail and former residential property space into accommodation but this process needs to be accelerated.  We call on the Government to introduce emergency legislation to change the function of NAMA to maximise social gain through the transfer of NAMA properties to local authorities.  This would take the function of NAMA beyond the provision of a social dividend and solidify its role in the State's development of social housing, which will benefit the taxpayer in the long term.<\/p> <p> There are several factors feeding into this crisis, as the Minister stated yesterday evening.  The staggering increase in homelessness is a result of uncontrolled rent levels, predominantly in large urban centres.  Not only are those people on rent supplement and RAS at severe risk of homelessness but those with jobs are absolutely squeezed and forced to live in substandard conditions as they cannot afford ever increasing rents.  I welcome any acknowledgement on the Minister's part that rents must be regulated.  However, given that the country has slipped into a state of emergency, I call on him to take immediate action to introduce rent control and security of tenure, as this Bill proposes.<\/p> <p> The mortgage to rent scheme has delivered just over 100 units throughout the country, an appalling return on a scheme that has the potential to be maximised, ensuring people remain in their homes.  In addition, considering the current rates of mortgage arrears, mortgage to rent, in conjunction with an urgent cap on mortgage interest rates, could be implemented by the Government to help address the difficult situation facing people in mortgage distress.<\/p> <p> We believe that every citizen of this country has a right to adequate provision of housing to ensure a quality of life for all our people.  We call on the Government to support our solutions to this crisis and to recognise the degree to which this crisis has pervaded our society.  With that in mind, we call on the Minister and all Deputies in this House to support our Private Members' motion.  We reject any attempts to water down or amend what is a very important Private Members' motion with massive repercussions for our people and their rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000066#OOO02800","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1443635700,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 69; N\u00edl, 39.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Dessie Ellis and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000067#PPP00200","aye":["1062","980","974","1079","989","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1093","1087","1099","1006","986","994","1091","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1014","1085","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1033","1012","1088","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","1082","977","1004","1070","985","1056","955","1060","1058","1069","1073","1061","1081","966","1074","1013","1025","1048","961","978","1010","950","1024"],"nay":["1199","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1195","1101","1037","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1108","1094","960","954","983","1008","1017","1090","993","981","987","1202","969","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","1203","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443635700,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>Question put: &quot;That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443635700,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1443635700,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>As a teller, under Standing Order 69 I propose that the vote be taken by other than electronic means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000067#PPP00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1443635700,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>As Deputy Ellis is a Whip, under Standing Order 69 he is entitled to call a vote through the lobby.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000067#PPP00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"vote","time":1443635700,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Question again put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 68; N\u00edl, 40.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Dessie Ellis and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000067#PPP00600","aye":["1062","980","974","1079","989","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1093","1087","1099","1006","986","994","1091","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1014","1085","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1033","1012","1088","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","1082","977","1004","1070","985","1056","955","1060","1058","1069","1073","1061","1081","966","1074","1013","1025","1048","961","978","950","1024"],"nay":["1199","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1195","1101","1037","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1050","1094","960","954","983","998","1008","1017","1090","993","981","987","1202","969","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","1203","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443635700,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.40 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 October 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
