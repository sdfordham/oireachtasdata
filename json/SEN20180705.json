The teratogenic effects of valproate, as the Minister of State will be aware, were first reported in the 1980s and have been widely accepted since the mid-1990s.  Last year, the French regulator said women taking valproate were four times more likely to give birth to babies with malformations.  The types of birth defects attributed to the drug include spina bifida, autism and developmental problems as well as neural tube defects, malformation of limbs, digits and organs and cleft palate.  Bipolar women taking the drug were twice as likely to give birth to children with major birth defects.  The FACS Forum Ireland is the umbrella group of organisations that have come together to advocate for better services and supports for families and children affected by foetal anticonvulsant syndrome.<\/p> <p>The crux of the matter is that parents were not informed of the risks or risk reduction measures that needed to be put in place.  Therefore, they continued to be prescribed valproate during pregnancy.  The European Medicines Agency introduced measures to strengthen the warnings and restrictions on the use of valproate in women and girls.  In February of this year, following a further review, the agency issued additional instructions aimed at further reducing the risks of this drug.  While there are no definitive Irish data on how many children may have been affected by exposure to valproate, the FACS Forum Ireland estimates that more than 400 children have been affected since 1983, and I know some of these children.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin has indicated that 43 children have received a diagnosis of foetal anticonvulsant syndrome.<\/p> <p>We urgently need an independent investigation into the historical prescribing of valproate to pregnant women.  If the Minister of State or the Minister has decided that an independent investigation is not warranted, I want to know in detail why.  We need an investigation to address whether and how existing cases of FACS could have been prevented; whether appropriate and timely information was provided to healthcare professionals and patients in line with knowledge at the time; whether appropriate decision-making processes were in place concerning the treatment of women taking valproate in line with knowledge at the time; whether appropriate regulatory steps have been taken over time to ensure patient safety; and how a system of redress should be established to meet the lifelong care needs of children and the impact of diagnosis on their families to avoid the need for legal solutions for already burdened families.<\/p> <p>I believe the valproate project group has met many times, but we are still waiting for the Department of Health to sign off on funding for the group.  Has this funding been signed off on?  This is one of the main things I want to leave here knowing today.  If the money has not been signed off on, why not?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In November last year the French Government approved a &euro;10 million fund to meet compensation, and it said that was just a starting point for what it needed to do.  In February of this year the British Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced a review of how valproate concerns were handled in the past.  A do-nothing approach is not acceptable in this State.  Appropriate services must be put in place for these children and their families.  Valproate-related disabilities are complex, wide-ranging and individual.  Obtaining diagnosis in Ireland is difficult and lengthy.  Treatment often involves attending a multitude of unconnected and uncoordinated speciality services.  Families often have more than one child affected, and in many cases are caring full time for a number of children.  It is critical that appropriate supports are put in place.  I know families who are desperately in need of therapies and treatment which they cannot afford.  Parents have to give up work to care for these children with disabilities that were avoidable at the time.  They have no income, and they have no means of getting the support and services they need.  That must be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#A00600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I accept it is a hugely important issue which criss-crosses my own portfolio relating to children with disabilities.  As she noted, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health recently published a report on sodium valproate and the foetal anticonvulsant syndrome, FACS, following a meeting with FACS Forum Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the HSE.  The joint committee's report includes a number of recommendations, all of which are being considered and are being implemented by the HSE, the HPRA and my own Department.  The first three recommendations made by the joint committee relate to measures recommended by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, on foot of a review of valproate medicines which took place in 2017 and early 2018.  Following the European Commission's decision to endorse EMA recommendations, valproate medicines are now contraindicated in women who are able to have children, unless the terms of special pregnancy prevention programme are met.  This programme includes measures to ensure patients taking Valproate are fully aware of the risk and the need to avoid becoming pregnant while taking it.<\/p> <p>I am happy to report the HPRA has made significant progress in implementing the EMA's recommendations that fall under its remit.  In March, for example, the HPRA approved an application to include a warning on the outer carton of the drug packaging in the form of a visual symbol and box warning.  The HPRA also approved an application to include a visual warning symbol on the drug's blister pack.  In early June, the marketing authorisation holder distributed the new Valproate educational materials approved by the HPRA to all relevant healthcare professionals and patient groups.  These educational materials include a patient guide, a healthcare professional guide, a patient card and an annual risk acknowledgement form, as recommended by the EMA.  Several of the recommendations made by the joint committee relate to providing a clear diagnostic pathway for children suspected of having FACS, and establishing support services for children and families affected.  This ties into the work of the HSE Valproate response team which developed a draft plan to address these particular issues.  Officials in my Department and the HSE are working together to identify the requirements for infrastructure and resources.  The joint committee also made recommendations concerning an investigation into the historical use of Valproate, as well as a consideration of the issue of compensation.<\/p> <p>There are several projects planned or early in progress that will give us a much clearer picture of the numbers affected by FACS., and of the information provided to patients and doctors at different points since the drug was fully licensed.  It is appropriate to allow these projects to conclude in the first instance.  <\/p> <p>Finally, I will need to give the issue of compensation further consideration, as recommended by the committee.  This issue is particularly complex given the number of different parties involved to one degree or other, where a woman is prescribed and dispensed sodium valproate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#B00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Karen Keely, chairperson of the Organisation for Anticonvulsant Syndrome, Ms Valerie Brenann, Ms Danielle Delaney, Ms Beverley Dunne and others to the Gallery.

It is one I have been kicking around since entering the Seanad.  Given the weather over the past number of weeks, it is particularly timely.  We know that weather does not recognise borders, so it makes perfect scientific, social, economic and agricultural sense that neither would those who provide us with our weather information.  There are people who move, go to school, work or farm on both sides of the Border, and in periods of adverse and emergency weather alerts we should operate in a more cooperative and cohesive way to ensure people are kept safe and have access to the fullest information available to them, given the nature of the Border and how open it is at the moment.  The Minister will have noticed on many instances over recent weeks, whether on \"The Late Late Show\" or Met &Eacute;ireann, the Six Counties in the north east have been amputated from many maps.

We have had debates here on the marine spatial strategy.  Latterly we have also tried to do that on a whole-island basis and engage with our colleagues across the Border as well.<\/p> <p>The response to all emergencies is appropriately locally led in the first instance.  Local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive are designated as the principal response agencies.  Local authorities are further designated by the framework for major emergency management as lead agency for co-ordinating the local response to severe weather events.  The generic response arrangements enabling the three principal response agencies to collaborate are set out in &ldquo;A Framework for Major Emergency Management&rdquo; which was published in 2006, together with a range of other guidance documents and protocols.  That is something we keep under constant review.  Local authorities liaise with the other principal response agencies - the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - and, where necessary, activate interagency structures to manage the response and incorporate a range of other agencies as well as communities themselves.<\/p> <p>Protocols in place in both this State and Northern Ireland provide guidance on the co-ordination of response and recovery during emergencies.  These protocols reflect the required responses to major emergencies in the Republic of Ireland and major incidents in Northern Ireland.  While emergencies can have different terminology in both jurisdictions, they effectively recognise the same types of events and incidents.  A range of bilateral arrangements are in place between local authorities and relevant agencies on both sides of the Border to cover the response to major emergencies that may occur in Border areas.  As the Senator said, the line on the map is not recognised by weather events.<\/p> <p>A number of service level agreements and memoranda of understanding are in place with agencies in Northern Ireland by virtue of the work carried out between individual emergency services on both sides of the Border, along an area classed as the Border corridor.  These agreements are for task-specific resources, which in the event of an emergency could be activated first.<\/p> <p>Fire services in counties along the Border corridor currently have both formal and informal arrangements regarding mutual aid support in emergency response situations.  Both jurisdictions provide assistance when requested from their colleagues across the Border.  For example, Donegal fire service has a formal memorandum of understanding in place with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service covering the response to fires.<\/p> <p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is designated as the lead Department for co-ordinating the response to severe weather.  When the local-level response is stretched or when national-level assistance is required, the Department convenes a national emergency co-ordination group, NECG.  People have seen that in action during the previous two status-red weather warnings we had in the past 12 months.  The NECG co-ordinates the response measures in place and deals with emerging issues.  The NECG will arrange for relevant Departments and agencies to liaise with their equivalents in Northern Ireland as required.<\/p> <p>The national steering group on major emergency management has approved \"Host Nation Support Guidance for the Principal Response Agencies\".  This document details arrangements that would be required and activated in the event of Ireland requesting international assistance, including in respect of assistance received from Northern Ireland.

I am sure the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister for Education and Skills and I know he will relay my concerns.<\/p> <p>The Government&rsquo;s plan to increase provision of multidenominational and non-denominational schools is dependent on choice.  With this in mind, surveys of parents of preschool children were completed in recent months.  These surveys of parents in 16 areas across the country commenced the schools reconfiguration for diversity process to fulfil a key action in the Action Plan for Education, which aims to make Ireland&rsquo;s education and training service the best in Europe by 2026.  <\/p> <p>These childcare surveys should use approved methodology to identify the exact needs of the whole community by gathering information in a systematic way.  However, I have been contacted by a number of my people in my area who felt they were not consulted during this survey.  In fact, they felt actively excluded.  Tullow with 4,673 citizens is the third largest town in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency only surpassed by Kilkenny city with 26,512 citizens and Carlow town with 24,272 citizens.  Tullow is now the 94th largest population centre in Ireland.  The town and surrounding areas have nine primary schools, eight of Catholic patronage and one of Church of Ireland patronage, and one post-primary school, which provided educational facilities for the town and the surrounding hinterland.  <\/p> <p>Tullow is an important service centre in north-east Carlow and has a significant role in accommodating future population growth and economic development of the area.  This role in County Carlow and its growing population urged an examination of the need for multidenominational and non-denominational school for the town to see if there was an appetite within the area for an Educate Together school.  <\/p> <p>The anonymous survey asked parents to indicate if they were happy with the current primary school provision and what type of primary school they would choose for their children.  However, if a child was not attending an ECCE-approved preschool in the area, his or her parents were not asked their opinion.  Parents who work outside of Tullow and place their small children in a cr&egrave;che or Montessori closer to their workplace for convenience were not consulted.  Public health nurses who have access to the information of all children in the target group were not consulted to balance up the numbers to ensure all parents were consulted.<\/p> <p>In the survey, some parents, whose intention is to send their child to an Educate Together school already in another area closer their work, were asked their opinion.  The numbers then do not give a true reflection of satisfaction with the currently available choice.  Given that only a fraction of the population of potential primary school children had access to the survey, it indicates that the survey results cannot possibly give a true reflection of the need or desire for a multidenominational or non-denominational school for primary aged children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->No parent of a child currently in the school system who did not have a younger sibling in ECCE-approved preschool was asked for his or her opinion.<\/p><p>We have a problem getting DEIS status in Tullow.

I am taking this matter on his behalf and I will set out for the Seanad the position in terms of the schools reconfiguration for diversity process.<\/p> <p>In January 2017, the Minister announced new plans aimed at accelerating the provision of multidenominational and non-denominational schools across the country in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the programme for Government commitment to reach 400 such schools by 2030.  He would like to point out that the previous model of patronage divestment yielded only a limited number of schools for transfer to multidenominational patrons, and only ten since 2013.  He believes that this new schools reconfiguration for diversity process, which will involve the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system.  He also believes that lessons have been learned from the previous process.<\/p> <p>The main provision of the schools reconfiguration for diversity process involves a survey of preschool parents across specific geographical areas and the potential for a subsequent transfer of patronage of a school by the existing patron to a multidenominational or non-denominational patron on the basis of a report on the survey outcomes.  This process consists of two separate and distinct phases.  The identification phase includes the current roll-out of surveys across 16 pilot areas, including Tullow, and is being conducted by the educational training boards, ETBs.  This phase is under way.  The ETBs have identified, on the basis of census date, towns or areas where there is likely to be demand from families for a greater diversity of school patronage.  The ETBs have worked with Childcare Committees Ireland, CCI, to establish evidence of this demand among a cohort of preschool parents, via surveys being facilitated by the relevant local city and county childcare committees in conjunction with the CCI.  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and existing patrons or landowners concerning the possible transfer of existing schools to accommodate a demonstrated demand for diversity of patronage.  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of indicated demand arising from the surveys and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.  These reports will be published on the website for the Department of Education and Skills, with quarterly reports on implementation.<\/p> <p>The second phase relates to implementation.  In the event that the identification phase reveals a level of demand for multidenominational schools sufficient to justify transfer of at least one school from denominational to multidenominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to this.  There will be a role for the existing patron or landowner in consulting with local community and school interests.  The development of protocols for the implementation phase is proceeding.  It is clear from the discussions that have taken place that all parties, including church authorities, want the process of the selection of a new patron to reflect the wishes of the parents and school community.  In agreeing the protocols for the implementation phase, the Department of Education and Skills will be clear that, in arranging for transfers of schools to multidenominational patrons, the choice of alternative patronage should be based on principles of transparency and co-operation, and reflect the wishes of parents.  The Minister for Education and Skills has already stated his belief that the best way to achieve this will be to hold a public meeting where each prospective patron can make his or her case to the school community, followed by a vote of all parents within that school community whether they attended the meeting or not.  It is envisaged that in most cases transfer will be by way of voluntary live school transfer rather than the amalgamation and closure model that formed the basis of the previous patronage divesting process.  It is expected that in many cases the school property will simply be leased at a modest or nominal rent from the existing landowner.<\/p> <p>I hope that I have clarified the position and reaffirmed that Tullow, and other areas, are being considered in a proper and clear way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#D00150","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

I am aware that the Government is particularly anxious to get the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 through the House.  It is a priority as far as it is concerned, and it is very important to the Government that it be passed in the Seanad before the summer recess.  The other proposals regarding the Order of Business are quite acceptable but I would like to hear the views of the other Members of the House on this particular matter.<\/p> <p>I accept the establishment of a committee of the Seanad relating to Brexit.  It is important and significant.  The last committee prepared a report.  I would like to see more emphasis on the implementation of that report, or at least its promotion, before we go into another report and have another deadline at the end of December, because the countdown to March 2019 is on.  That is the month in which the United Kingdom proposes to leave the European Union.  The period between now and then is crucial.  After that time there will be no more contesting of the European elections.  That is a fact.  I do not see any prospect of a reversal of the decision via another referendum, despite what we might hope for.  From my experience, as a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and as a representative of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, for the meeting next week in Vienna, I do not believe there will be any change in the situation in the United Kingdom in the near future from either the Conservatives or the Labour Party.  The priority must be that all the resources of the State are used to ensure that we get the best deal possible for this island.  We are an island off an island off the coast of Europe.  I respect the value of a seat on the United Nations Security Council, which is important.  We had one before and I do not believe it created a great reaction or contributed much to the economy.  I believe the resources of the State should be focused solely on Brexit, and that all contributions and ideas should be considered.  <\/p> <p>I gave a lecture last Tuesday at the National College of Ireland.  It is a college that is working on solutions to problems.  It is very advanced in the area of cloud computing and it is now investigating what would need to happen to ensure a seamless border which would not have to be controlled.  I accept that the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic must remain as it is now, without any barriers whatsoever.  I also understand the concerns of the Democratic Unionist Party, which does not want to see a border down the Irish Sea.  Negotiations are continuing.  We look forward to the outcome of the negotiations of the British Government at Chequers tomorrow.  I hope that it will take a united approach.  At the end of the day, our interests are primary and vital but I also believe that a good deal for the United Kingdom should be a good deal for the Republic of Ireland.  <\/p> <p>It is important that the proposed committee is established and that it meets as soon as possible.  We should remember that work is going on elsewhere as well - I am the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs - and I hope that committee will be up and running as quickly as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G00800","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Arising from the proposal for the Order of Business and the first motion, which is to be discussed after the matter to be taken without debate relating to proposals to meet and consider Committee Stage of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill further on Monday, I want to indicate a few things at this stage, without anticipating the debate on that proposal, which I presume we will discuss further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>That matter is to be taken without debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>The Senator has only one bite of the cherry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G01100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Now that I have seen the GRECO report, I really feel that the attitude of the Government on this matter has been shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G01200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#G01300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There has been concealment and deception and it is wrong.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is all motivated by a desire to slip things through so as to satisfy the ego of one person in a hurry.

It is a hard-working body, which serves this House very well.  It works and assists the Members of this House in doing their work well.

I have been contacted by many people, mostly women, who are unable to receive their entire pension entitlements due to the 2012 changes.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long called for the reform of the way the contributory pension is calculated but we do not want to see bad legislation replaced by new legislation that will see others affected.  I welcome that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, launched a public consultation recently on the proposed changes but I am worried that these changes, as they stand at the moment, may end up with a different category of people being unable to access a full pension.  It is being reported that up to 40 years of social insurance contributions will be needed to qualify for a full State pension.  This is completely unobtainable for those who became employed in 1988 and will be retiring in 2020.  The most they can amass is 32 years, leaving them considerably short.<\/p> <p>There is also the issue of the women born before 1950 who are not being looked at.  This is age discrimination and it is not acceptable.  Older women should be looked at first.  Their retirements are turning out to be really miserable.  They need fairness but they also need the money that is owed to them paid back to them and that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>The Department has confirmed that over 40,000 pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes will be contacted from autumn 2018 and will be invited to have their pensions reviewed.  I hope that by that stage, this new anomaly can be addressed.  It is not good enough to strive for the fairest possible solution that leaves people in an impossible situation, quite literally unable to do anything to change their past contributions.  The sense of helplessness adds to the frustration felt by many of those affected.  Pensioners already face huge challenges in planning for the future, and they do not need further cause for concern that they will not have enough to get by in later years.<\/p> <p>Recently, an assistant principal officer at the Department stated it was difficult to do something that was fair and affordable at the same time.  A fair system would allow both the average and the total contributions model to continue to include self-employed and part-time workers.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister to come into the House to discuss the issue of pensions and the anomalies within the pensions system that are pushing many people, as they retire and as they get into their elder years, into poverty.

For the best part of a century, we turned our eyes away from those brave men and women who went to war in 1914 to 1918.  Today, it is quite respectable to have a couple of First World War medals.  We are all searching around in our drawers to dust off the medals of our grandparents and great grandparents.  Let us give them some thought over the weekend.  Anyone who has ever been out to the Somme or any of the other grave areas in France will know that it is heartbreaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#J00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>At this time of year, especially with the sun shining, it might seem strange to raise this subject, but it is one I have raised many times.  Every winter there is flooding and coastal erosion, and nowhere more so than in The Burrow in Portrane.  One family has had to abandon their home there, 13 other families face the same prospect and two businesses will also have to leave unless action is taken.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, on coming to The Burrow in Portrane.  He understands the problem and has shown great interest in it.  Fingal County Council is coming to the completion of the measures that it needs to take immediately to protect the remaining 13 homes and those two businesses, and it needs approval from the Minister of State and funding to implement those plans.  Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister of State to come before the House to outline that he will give approval to this, which I know he wishes to do?  We do not want 13 families to lose their homes to the sea, along with two businesses.  They deserve the help of the State to be able to stay in their homes, particularly in the midst of a homelessness and housing crisis.  I hope that the Minister of State will take action immediately and allow us to do this work in the best conditions during the summer, not in the middle of the storms of winter.<\/p> <p>I also welcome confirmation by the insurance industry that it will make funds to a dedicated Garda fraud insurance unit, something that the insurance alliance has been calling for and now the insurance industry is interested.

Nine new cases of cervical cancer have come to the fore.  The fact that it can be shown in advance whether the drug will have a good effect on a person is exciting for the patients.  The HSE should trial this on patients and make it available as soon as possible.  It is cost effective because it can be shown in advance whether it will work for a patient.

The manner in which it has been handled by Government is very disappointing.  I was under the impression we had entered a new era, the politics of consensus.  What we have is that an individual's pet project, which he wishes to see over the line, and the members of Government collectively trying to facilitate that.  That is very disappointing.  What is going on is clear.  We had our suspicions and Senator McDowell highlighted what our friends in Europe thought during the week.

That highlights the difficulties for local authority members, and he put it that we were asking people to do a full-time job for effectively a part-time wage.  I know that Government has belatedly grasped this issue and is conducting a review.  I hope a report will issue shortly on the terms and conditions for councillors.  It is vitally important that the report is fast-tracked and that we reach a conclusion.  Local democracy is the most important layer of democracy.

We really have to consider that these are core jobs and the community cannot function without the work of people on these schemes.  There has been no replacement for the jobs initiative, JI, scheme.  These were core staff who paid the wages and ensured the community employment programmes were up and running, there was work to be done, the pitches were marked and childcare was provided.

I am concerned about the report this week that shows there has been an increase in the number of racist incidents and in racism.  This situation is not unconnected to the type of language used to describe migration across Europe.  It can be at the lowest level with the subtlest of dog whistles, in the outright racism by other leaders in Europe, in the suggestions that we have a problem, that migrants pose a danger and hence we need to control them and in the very dehumanising treatment of migrants.  We have criticised Trump at length due to his policy of separating children from their parents on the Mexican border.  However, we need to ask questions in Ireland and Europe about racism.  Today, representatives of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.  One representative of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res said that last week was the \"deadliest\" week on the Mediterranean Sea with the highest loss of life.  Are we happy to allow people drown in the Mediterranean Sea and thus act as a deterrent?  We cannot use children, families or human beings as examples.  We cannot dehumanise them.  Devaluing people sends a very negative signal, all of which is connected to racism.  The articles on the report pointed to certain factors such as Brexit, Trump, the political narrative on migration and whether migrants create pressures when we know that they are an asset to society.<\/p> <p>I urge the Government to consider a practical suggestion.  In the past I had the honour of being a board member of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI.  It was a constructive State body that was created to drive constructive and positive discussions on inclusion and anti-racism.  Unfortunately, the NCCRI and the Combat Poverty Agency were dissolved at the beginning of the recession.  That was the exact time that we needed organisations to tackle poverty and issues like racism.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask whether we can revisit the question of creating a new national consultative committee for racism and interculturalism or a similar initiative.

Tomorrow the workers in Lloyds Pharmacy will take their fourth day of strike action.  Lloyds Pharmacy is owned by the McKesson Corporation, which has annual revenues of &euro;198.5 billion.  Yesterday evening we had a presentation from some of the workers.  I regret to say nobody from the Fine Gael side took the time to come along.  We heard a couple of interesting facts.  The first is these people are extremely poorly paid.  We heard from one lady who, after working for Lloyds Pharmacy for 15 years, received a pay increase of the princely sum of 5 cent an hour, which brought her up, after those 15 years, to &euro;10.50.<\/p> <p>The second fact is the McKesson Corporation deals with unions all the time.  For example, it owns United Drug and has no problem with doing a deal with the unions there.  It recognises them and pays decent wages.  Interestingly, the workforce of United Drug is predominantly male while at Lloyds Pharmacy the workforce is almost exclusively female, and they have been completely denied the right to collective bargaining.  It is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the State and the workers are denied even a basic sick pay scheme.<\/p> <p>My point is we have this huge corporation earning millions of euro in taxpayers' money through the HSE medical card scheme and something needs to be done about this.  The Government needs to address this issue of companies flagrantly disregarding the industrial relations machinery of the State, flagrantly disregarding the Labour Court in this case, and flagrantly disregarding workers' rights and continuing to receive massive largesse.  Last week, we united to call for full support for Lloyds Pharmacy workers.  We need to re-echo this call.  These people are fighting for fundamental workers' rights and they are being treated appallingly by one of the richest corporations in the world.  I contend that one of the reasons for this is the predominantly female workforce.  If we want to understand the gender pay gap look at how Lloyds Pharmacy is treating its workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#M00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of French Delegation","time":1530783000,"counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#M00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>May I at this stage, before I call the next speaker, say <i>bonjour<\/i>to the French friendship group visiting the Parliament.

It is an important committee.  I call on the Deputy Leader to bring the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation before the House to talk about the interaction she has had with her counterpart in the UK regarding the trade between Ireland and UK.  It is probably as important to the UK as it is to Ireland because it has a trade surplus approaching &euro;6 billion with Ireland.  It has a lot of companies depending on exports to Ireland as we have companies depending on exports to the UK, with certain sectors very exposed.  I would like to hear what the Minister is doing to support Irish exports to the UK market.<\/p> <p>The second issue I want to touch on is to call for a debate on the pensions crisis facing all of us.  The reality is that many people today who are in their 20s, 30s, 40s and even 50s will have little or no State pension availability by the time they reach pension age as a result of the lack of investment in the pension fund.  People are ageing.  They are now expected to work longer before they become eligible for a pension.  The interdepartmental working group identified that outside of the public sector, 60% of Irish employees have no occupational pension.  Therefore, they are dependent solely on the State pension, which will not be there come pension age for these people.  This is a crisis.  It does not get highlighted because it is not in the electoral cycle, but it will be in the electoral cycle in ten or 15 years when it will be too late to do anything about it.  Now is the time.

I commend and thank the Deputy Leader of the House who made a remarkable speech on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  It was a brave and courageous speech and I would expect nothing less from her.  That distinguishes leadership and politics.  I acknowledge a whip structure is in place for political parties as opposed to Independents, but she had the courage of her convictions when she spoke and set out her stall.  I acknowledge that because it is the mark of a politician and someone with leadership who is prepared to decipher the difference between blind loyalty to a political establishment and taking a reasonable and rational view of things.  There is also the fact she is an experienced lawyer.  This brings an awful lot of weight and I acknowledge it because it was a significant and important contribution.<\/p> <p>It is very important that we have this GRECO report today.  I played back the contributions of the Minister yesterday and it was absurd.  We had the Minister tell us in the House that he had not even read it.  Then he told one of the Senators not to worry that he will allay all of our fears.  Yesterday evening he told us he had a look at it yesterday.  I am putting out an appeal here today.  Today at Cabinet it was agreed to publish the report.  I want the Minister to tell us what day he received it because he did not answer us the other night.  I am putting him on notice now that if he does not do so this very day I will make a freedom of information request of the Department of Justice and Equality to ascertain who, be it the Secretary General or the Minister, received the GRECO report, when it was received and when it was brought to the Minister's attention.  He failed to give us any clarity on this matter.  I want to put on the record that this day I will put in a formal freedom of information request to the Department with regard to the Secretary General, the Minister and his staff.  He has time today when he comes back in to clearly clarify the point.<\/p> <p>We have an opportunity to defend the judicial independence of our State.  We have an opportunity to ensure our Constitution is in no way eroded with regard to the independence of the Judiciary and the appointment of its members.  I will make another appeal, as my friend, Senator Michael McDowell, said earlier, to have respect for the Bills Office.  Do not push an enormous amount of work on the Bills Office for the next Stage when we complete this Stage.  It also has a hard job to do.  We must respect that and value it.  I hope we will give it the time and space to let it do its work in terms of preparing for the next Stage of the Bill.  I acknowledge the staff.  I particularly acknowledge the Bills Office and the Seanad Office for the support they give us an ongoing basis, but particular the Bills Office regarding this matter.  It is important the message goes out loud and clear from here.  We generally as Senators are not prepared to make unreasonable demands of the Bills Office on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#M00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I want to put on the record of the House my disbelief that last night Ireland passed into law a Bill that actually endangers nature and the wildlife of this island, a Bill that is anything but a Heritage Bill.

At a committee meeting a year ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, told me:<\/p><blockquote>It needs to be understood that we have to live down there.

I look forward to the day a progressive Government repeals the Heritage Act because, quite frankly, it is trash.

There is nothing decided in that regard at this point.  I am of a similar view that time is required between Committee Stage and Report Stage, especially on a Bill as large and important.  Time should not be an issue.  In fairness, we have spent ten hours on Committee Stage, notwithstanding my comments on the Bill itself.

Senator McFadden raised the Defence Forces and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  She is a constant voice for the Defence Forces, and outlined many issues.  The Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, should come in to discuss the issues which she and Senator Craughwell have raised on a regular basis.

It is an issue that might be served well by tabling a Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>On the issue of Garda investigations for insurance fraud, I have dealt with much insurance litigation over the years and I found it frustrating as a lawyer to deal with cases where I know the plaintiff is clearly trying it on.  For every one of those, there are plenty of genuine cases.  However, that behaviour increases the overall cost.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, will have to come to the House to address that.  Significant resources are needed by the Garda, as are training and innovative ways of dealing with insurance fraud.  Everyone would welcome this from the point of view of bringing down the overall cost of insurance for businesses.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of cervical cancer and the Scally review.  She acknowledges Dr. Scally needs to be given the space and support from the HSE when it comes to the availability of documentation electronically, which was a frustration for him.  I agree with her point about a clinical trial, which would make eminent sense.  Such a trial would be the most cost-effective approach for women in those circumstances.  It is something I would push for as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik proposed an amendment to the Order of Business and raised the GRECO report.  I do not disagree with her that we should be given sight of that.  She also raised the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  I am not sure if that will be in the House before the end of term but I will inquire and revert to the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne also raised cervical cancer issue and backed a call for a trial drug that has been used by a county woman of hers to great effect.  Any woman in a situation like that would like to have access to such a trial or the drug.  I agree with her on that.  She also mentioned a good news story about National Science Foundation awards.  It is an initiative that is worth supporting, highlighting and building on.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher also raised the judicial appointments Bill.  He then mentioned the councillors' terms and conditions, which have been raised on all sides of the House.  Councillor Geoghegan from Waterford was on the radio this morning.  I have come across many councillors who simply do not see the point in doing the job for the reasons the Senator outlined.  We need to have a good conversation about the idea of wanting councillors to do a full-time job for a part-time wage.  We should either make it a full-time job, or truly have a part-time expectation from the job.  That would involve major review and change in how we approach local government.  It would be worthwhile, and more meaningful than talking about terms and conditions, if debate how we should approach governance structurally.<\/p> <p>Senator Humphreys raised the jobs initiative scheme, JI, and the services it provides in communities.  It strikes me as a matter on which he might get a helpful answer through a Commencement matter.

Reducing insurance costs is a very challenging area but is clearly an issue.  The Senator asked for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House.  I do not have access to this Minister at this precise moment, but I imagine we would have a difficulty getting him in today.  I am sure we would have a lot of questions to ask him if we were to get him into the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#N01000","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>He was having his breakfast two hours ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#O00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>It is more an issue for Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in technical terms, but clearly it is relevant to the transport area also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#O00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>He is not confined to his own Department.

I was pleased last December when the Government announced that eligibility for a general practitioner, GP, service without fees was to be extended to all people in receipt of a carer's allowance payment.  Following further examination of the proposal, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, confirmed in April that this measure should also be extended to persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to provide a general medical and surgical service free of charge to persons in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance, both full rate and half rate, or carer&rsquo;s benefit.  This Bill will result in approximately 14,000 additional people being eligible for a GP visit card.  It will enable them to access vital GP services without having consider their ability to pay for the service.<\/p> <p>Becoming a carer for a loved one is a life-changing experience.  Each day can bring new demands, new highs and new lows.  The 2016 census noted that over 195,000 people, that is,  4.1% of the population, provided unpaid assistance to others.  This amounted to a total of 6.6 million hours of care per week.  Some of this care is provided on a 24-7 basis by family members or unpaid carers.  Carers come from different walks of life and enter into their caring responsibilities at different stages in their lives.  Their reasons for beginning this journey, however, are the same.  They are all motivated by their love for the person they are looking after and they also have an expert knowledge of the person that no one else could have.  While there are many positive and rewarding aspects to caring, it can also place physical and emotional demands on carers who are trying to balance their own well-being with the needs of those for whom they care.  <\/p> <p>It is also recognised that being a carer can have financial consequences, with many carers having to either reduce their working hours or even give up work entirely.  This is, of course, often done unselfishly but nevertheless it is important to recognise that this can create a burden on carers in a variety of ways.  In recognition of the significant contribution and commitment that family carers make and the concerns they face, the Government developed Ireland&rsquo;s first national carer&rsquo;s strategy in 2012.  The strategy sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided to carers by Departments and Government agencies.  On healthcare, the strategy recognised the need to support carers in maintaining their own physical and mental health.  <\/p> <p>We do recognise, however, that both time and money constraints can sometimes make this very difficult.  The question often asked is, who cares for the carers?  There is no doubt they need and deserve acknowledgement, understanding and support from their fellow citizens and from their Government.  To that end, a number of initiatives have been progressed in recent years to aid carers.  These include increases of &euro;5 in the social welfare payments made to carers in budgets 2017 and 2018 and an extension from six to 12 weeks for the continuation of these payments after the death of a person who was cared for or his or her entry into residential care.  This has gone some way to ease the financial burden on the shoulders of carers.  <\/p> <p>Last December, it may be remembered, an additional investment of &euro;10 million in respite care services was announced.  This will deliver greater provision in respite care for people with disabilities, enable more carers to take a break from the daily caring routine and provide them with much needed time to maintain their own health and well-being.  The provision of a free GP service is another important milestone in the Government&rsquo;s continued support for carers.  It is another major step.  The provision of high-quality GP care, centred on the needs of carers, is essential to ensure that carers' own health does not deteriorate.  This is particularly the case because we know that their health tends to deteriorate gradually as their hours of caring increase over time.  The Health Service Executive has indicated that carers will be able to apply for a GP visit card from 1 September 2018.  If we do this today, we can move fast.  Applicants will be facilitated to make either a paper or online application.  <\/p> <p>The provisions of the Bill are straightforward and I will outline the main provisions.  Section 1 provides the relevant definitions, section 2 provides that the HSE&rsquo;s appeals process be extended to encompass this service and section 3 provides that the HSE&rsquo;s current \"ordinarily resident\" framework be extended to this new service.  Section 4 provides for a GP medical and surgical service to be provided free of charge for persons in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s benefit or full or half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and for the assignment of a GP of choice, where practicable.  That enables the HSE to request the necessary documentation from applicants to establish if they are, or continue to be, eligible for this new service.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for the Long and Short Titles of the Act and the relevant commencement provisions.<\/p> <p>All of us will be touched by caring at some point in our lives and that is the experience of most Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il, whether we take on a caring role or need care ourselves.  For me, this Bill is about looking out for people who spend their time looking out for others.  Caring for those in need provides a major contribution to health and social care in Ireland.  Our Government recognises the major contribution carers make to the welfare of others and we aim to strive for a society that respects, values and supports these carers.  The needs of carers are being considered across Government and I would hope that we will receive cross-party support on this important legislation.  To conclude, I am pleased to bring forward this legislation.  I take this opportunity to stress the importance of enacting this legislation before the summer recess in order that this service can be in place for carers in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#T00700","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am very happy to support this Bill, which will provide for eligibility for GP services without charge to be extended to all those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance is a payment to people on low incomes looking after a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness, including mental illness.  Similarly, carer&rsquo;s benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for a people in need of full-time care and attention.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite grant, now the carer's support grant, were introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  I spoke to the Minister earlier about an issue that I have also spoken about to our health spokesperson, Deputy Donnelly.  I have also been working on it with Senator Murnane O'Connor, who has been doing great work with Ms Catherine Cox, who looks after the carers in Carlow.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Keith Swanick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A cohort of people lose the carer's benefit after 104 weeks, but, of course, they continue to care for people.  This cohort, which numbers 6,000 to 8,000 nationally, should also qualify under this scheme.  <\/p><p>In seeking submissions from the general public to the loneliness task force we received a significant volume of correspondence from carers.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, there are 360,000 family carers in Ireland.  Family carers provide care and support to a person with a disability, chronic condition, mental health concern or long-term illness.  They care for the person in their own home and as a result are usually confined to the home unless there is a suitable respite service, or another family member is available at that time to take over caring responsibilities.  The majority of family carers in an Irish study reported major restrictions on their social or leisure activities, with isolation being a problem for many.  They take up the mantle of caring for others with their own health often suffering as a result.<\/p><p>The Bill intends to remove the financial barrier to accessing a GP to encourage people to seek treatment at an earlier stage, rather than delaying the decision to seek care until the point at which the illness has progressed to the point where it requires hospitalisation, which is a much more expensive form of care.  In the next 30 years, the number of people in Ireland aged over 65 will double and the number aged over 85 will almost quadruple.  We are living longer than our ancestors could ever have envisioned, but inevitably as we grow old we will all experience the ailments and disabilities which are part and parcel of ageing.  We need to look after our most vulnerable and those taking care of them.<\/p><p>Despite my bias, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the horrendous condition of general practice and how it is being crippled under the current Government.  There is no point in giving GP visit cards to carers if there are no GPs to look after them.  GPs have faced repeated cuts.  There is an almost complete breakdown between GPs and the HSE with regards to retention and recruitment.  According to some estimates, seven out of ten GP surgeries are no longer taking new patients.  This is an important aspect of this Bill; it is not a tangent.  If we are to provide carers with GP visit cards, we need to have doctors to see them.  An inclusive process is needed.  Contract negotiations are meant to be under way with one union, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  However, the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, services 2,500 GPs.  We are not going to get unilateral support, and we are not going to get a contract negotiated and agreed unless all stakeholders are at the table.  <\/p><p>In August 2016, the Minister for Health stated: \"I think it is absolutely essential that we have the new contract negotiated and I want to see the NAGP as part of that... what I am doing is saying very clearly that when we get down to negotiating the GP contact, which I expect to happen by the end of the year, that the NAGP need to be in the room\".  That is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#T00800","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, taca&iacute;m leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  I would also like to welcome the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>This is welcome legislation.  The extension of the GP visit card to these categories of people is a welcome development, and the Minister of State has spoken clearly about the importance of carers to us as a community.  I speak from personal experience, like many others here.  I live with a person who is being cared for by my mother.  Everything the Minister of State said about the need to care for carers resonates strongly with me.  It relates to the interconnection of the physical, emotional and mental needs of carers and the inevitable stretch on the welfare of the primary caregiver that can make a dramatic difference in people's lives. <\/p> <p>The carer's allowance is a means-tested payment extended to 77,000 people on low incomes.  As countless reports and investigations in recent years have indicated, these people are under enormous physical, emotional and financial pressure as they care for loved ones.  Many of us watched the \"Prime Time\" special on this topic last December.  It shocked many people, showing as it did the problems faced by carers in stark terms.  I fully support the move to grant GP visit cards to people on the carer's benefit or the full-time or half-time carer's' allowance.<\/p> <p>However, in light of the concerns expressed by Family Carers Ireland and no doubt expressed to the Minister of State personally, does the legislation go far enough?  Family Carers Ireland points to a larger cohort of people, those in receipt of the carer's support grant.  The grant is not means-tested and it results in a &euro;1,700 annual payment to 105,000 people.  There are many people in receipt of that grant who do not qualify for the carer's allowance due to their income exceeding the means test., yet, in many cases, their need for additional supports may be just as urgent.  Would the Government consider extending the GP visit card to this cohort of people as well.  It is a larger cohort; it would no doubt cost extra were it to happen.  I do not know whether it has been costed or how much is envisaged.  The proposal before the Seanad will cost &euro;10 million per annum.  How much more would it cost to extend the GP visit card to those in receipt of the carer's support grant, formerly the respite care grant?  How much is involved?  Is it within the Government's plans?  Does the Minister of State think it will happen, and if so will it happen soon?<\/p> <p>We also have to be mindful of the problems facing GPs, even as we seek to widen access to GP visit cards.  The NAGP has pointed out  that GP practices are badly stretched, with widespread reports of people having difficulty finding a GP to take them on as patients.  The president of the NAGP, Dr. Maitiu O'Tuathail, spoke eloquently about these problems during the recent referendum campaign, as the Government sought to place even more pressure on GPs through the new abortion proposals.  His predecessor as president, Dr. Andrew Jordan, said that GP services could be as extinct as the Tasmanian tiger unless the Government intervened.  The Minister for Health has repeatedly said that GP services should be at the heart of  a new community-based system of healthcare, but where is the investment to make that aspiration a reality?  The scheme proposed in the Bill, and any extension of this scheme in the future, which I would strongly support, must be accompanied by a significant rethink of the way GP services are resourced currently and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#U00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Before I call on the next speaker, I would like to welcome our visitors to the Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#U00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for bringing forward this important legislation.

That can include trying to access services, working with services, arranging a GP call for the person they are caring for, taking them to the GP or the hospital or attending clinics on an ongoing basis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The people being cared for need ongoing support within the health services.  The proposal that carers, who are getting the carer's allowance, should get support themselves is very welcome.  The cost of providing a nursing home bed is approximately &euro;1,000 per person per week.  In many cases, care is being provided seven days per week so there is no break from it.  It is important, therefore, that we recognise carers and give them the support they require.<\/p><p>We need to do a lot more long-term planning.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill seeking to regulate home-care providers properly.  We are to have an increase in the population.  An additional 20,000 people per annum will reach the age of 65 and an additional 2,500 per annum will reach the age of 85.  That will pose challenges in itself.  The health system, as structured, will not be able to accommodate that increase.  Therefore, the people who provide care must be given support.<\/p><p>We also need to examine other areas.  I recently raised home care provision with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Representatives of home care providers whom I met reckon we need up to 10,000 additional home carers within the next few years.  We need to examine the social welfare system.  Someone working for three hours per day for five days per week will automatically lose any allowance he or she is getting under the social welfare system.  We need to restructure the system to encourage more people to up-skill and train to provide home care.  I refer to those who do not want to work 37.5 hours per week who would provide home care to people who do not have the benefit of somebody living in their house and caring for them.  This Bill, however, provides important supports for those who are so dedicated and committed to providing care to people, whether the latter are family members or others to whom they are very close.<\/p><p>It is interesting to consider the census data.  Over 60% of the carers are women.  Over 40% are aged between 40 and 59.  If one is in that age category and the person in care passes away, it is extremely difficult to re-enter the jobs market.  It is a huge change in life.  One must take time out of one's career to provide full-time care to a family member or close friend and one is at a huge financial loss in doing so.<\/p><p>I welcome this legislation, which offers the necessary support.  We need to reconsider what additional supports we can give to carers to make sure they receive the necessary recognition for the work they are doing.  Until quite recently, we were not giving that recognition.  We need to do so.  I thank the Minister again for introducing this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#U00400","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the Bill and its improved provisions for carers.  Carers are unsung heroes.  Sometimes they get fed up.  I say that because behind the unsung heroes is the hard reality of how they live and how we support them in what they are doing.  They deserve our respect, compassion and support.  They are the very reason for our amendment.  The contribution they make to our society is unquantifiable from social, community and financial points of view.  It is welcome that this Bill aims to improve the State services that are afforded to carers.<\/p> <p>Our carers deserve full access to all medical services.  Providing for medical and surgical services only, as this Bill does, is not enough.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports a full transition to universal healthcare for all citizens.  We need a national health service based on need, readily accessible from the cradle to the grave and funded by progressive taxation.  Fine Gael supported this concept in 2007.  It was in its famous, or perhaps mythical, five-point plan.  Two Fine Gael health Ministers have since come and gone: current Senator and colleague, Dr. James Reilly, and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  It was, in fact, the current Taoiseach who scrapped the plans.  The problem with the plan was that it involved privatising our health system through insurance contributions.  It was selling off our health practices to the highest for-profit bidder while leading to higher and higher prices for patients through premiums. That is evident from the deterioration in care given in some cases, as in the case in the headlines early in the week.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile, however.<\/p> <p>This plan was flawed, unfortunately.  Sl&aacute;intecare came along and recommended a universal single-tier health and social care system in which everyone has equitable access to services.  This is the correct approach.  We support it and have advocated this model for considerable time, best referenced in Sinn F&eacute;in's better4health document, which we launched two years ago. <\/p> <p>Where is Sl&aacute;intecare?  There is a fear that civil servants are now watering it down.  This is unacceptable.  The cross-party committee will not accept it and the people, or all the people we represent, will not accept it.  In planning for universal healthcare, we should be transitioning as many qualifying people as possible over to full medical cards.  There can be no half medical cards, no GP-only cards or any other watered-down provisions.  It needs to be all or nothing.  Every week we deal with people trying to gain access to a medical card, including the gravely ill.  I was dealing this morning with a woman in her 40s diagnosed with breast cancer.  She has no job any longer because of her illness.  She has had to jump through hoops trying to access her health entitlements.<\/p> <p>The Minister will know that I tabled an amendment in this regard that would allow for a provision within this Bill to give access to drugs and medicines to carers on top of the proposed services.  This amendment was ruled out of order due to a cost to the Exchequer.  I understand this but I want to outline to the Minister today why this amendment is important.  Many carers give up work entirely to care for their loved one.  They cannot feasibly continue a career while giving 24-7 care.  They devote their lives to keeping their loved ones &ndash; our citizens &ndash; at home and with their families.  At times, this is a really difficult decision to make.  It involves a complete change in lifestyle.  As Senator Swanick alluded to, it often results in a life of isolation and being hidden away.  <\/p> <p>This is about a lot more than money; the time that carers save the State is colossal.  There should never be a situation in which carers, because they have had to give of all or part of their income through leaving the formal workforce, cannot afford prescription costs and medicines.  It is a fairness issue.  Considering how much carers save the State, the very least we could do in return is offer a safety net to them.  They should never be counting pennies in an almost empty purse.  The &euro;5 increase that the Minister referred to has completely vanished.  The profits of the gas and electricity companies and the increases in rent have completely negated any &euro;5 increase.  The cost, according to the research document, is &euro;2.8 million per annum.  What I propose would be fairly cost-neutral if the efforts and everything done by carers, who effectively have mini treatment hospitals or centres at home, were accounted for.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the amendment.

More than that, I will take a moment to thank sincerely all the carers for the Trojan compassionate work they do.  They are the warriors at the front line.  We are starting the process of looking after them but we could do a lot more.  I hope the Minister of State will take seriously the suggestions made today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#V00200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and his officials.  This is a good day in terms of giving much needed support and respite to people and families.  It also has great benefit for the person who is being cared for, because the burden that is on their loved one weighs heavily on the person who is being cared for.  That is also to be acknowledged today.<\/p><p>I want to go back to a very useful document, namely, the Bills Digest written by Diarmaid O'Sullivan, which includes the policy background.  The documents notes that the &quot;Prime Time - Carers In Crisis&quot; special in December and the work by Rosita Boland in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>highlighted issues, including insufficient respite care, insufficient home care, dealing with challenging behaviour, which is one to let our minds rest on for a while, the detrimental impact of caring on carers' mental and physical health and concerns about what will happen to those cared for when the carer passes away.<\/p><p>We are making an important step today, but it is important to contextualise it in what still needs to be done.  A Programme for A Partnership Government states:<\/p><blockquote>Carers are the backbone of care provision in this country.  In 2012, the first ever Carer's Strategy was published.  We are committed to implementing it in full.  We wish to see greater involvement of family carers in the preparation of care plans, aiding the provision of care, together with more accessible training and respite care, to facilitate full support.  We also support an increase in Carer's Allowance and Carer's Benefit as well as improved access to counselling supports for carers.<\/blockquote> <p>I want to draw a relationship between this statement in 2016 and the fact, it would seem, that a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme delving into the crisis was what spurred this very welcome move.  Perhaps that is not the case, but it is the way it looks.  We have seen issues that have come into the public domain where families have made their personal situation public and where there has been a response.  I simply want to say that if there is no correlation between one thing and the other, the Government really needs to come out and show this is the case.  For a lot of people, there is still a sense that things will get responded to in some way when people are out there in the media, and that is not helpful.<\/p><p>We all know Family Carers Ireland, which was the Carers Association.  We have all benefitted not just from its advocacy work but the very practical work it does in every parish and townland in the country keeping people and their situations together.  One of the key issues it has, while welcoming the Bill and recognising it as a positive step, is that it is very frustrated at the decision to limit the card to carers in receipt of carer's allowance.  This imposes a means test by virtue of the fact the carer's allowance is means tested.  As such, this decision is at odds with the Government's commitment to introduce universal free GP access to all ages.  This means that while children under the age of six and those aged over 70 are granted a GP visit card regardless of their means, carers are treated differently.  This point has already been made by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and others.<\/p><p>I want to focus for a moment on people who receive the carer's support grant.  They are often what might be described as the squeezed middle.  They do not meet the means test.  In Diarmaid O'Sullivan's work we see that the majority of carers are women and most of them are between 40 and 60 years of age.  They are significant years, particularly for women but for adults in general.  They are looking over their shoulder in terms of children and family development and looking at ageing parents.  It is something that needs to be taken account of.<\/p><p>There is also the issue of the number of years that some people spend caring.  For some it is a two, three or five year stretch and for others it can start in their 20s or 30s.  I know the Minister of State is live to this issue, and it comes back to the idea of families being squeezed.  Many of the people being cared for need their houses adapted in some way or other.  We are not dealing with that today, but the housing adaptation grant is highly means tested.  If people have reasonable, but not great, means it is another thing they cannot get their hands on too easily.  There are issues that relate to the carer's support grant.  Often, one of the adults in the house has already had to give up work and forgo significant income that would help that household.  These are people of working age.  There is a squeezed group of people who do not meet the means test but who are really under pressure.  Having said that, I am very happy to see this and I welcome it very strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#W00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I welcome the Bill because it is a very good step in the right direction.  As others have done, I acknowledge the tremendous work done by carers in this country.  They provide care out of regard and love in many instances for those for whom they care.  Others do so through a commitment of wanting to help others.  It is important that through the Bill we have another small acknowledgement of the great work they do.  As has been pointed out by Senator Colm Burke, many give up their most productive years and find themselves trying to re-enter the job market in their late 50s and 60s, which is a daunting task, yet they do so willingly and knowingly.<\/p> <p>There are many other carers who will not be included in the Bill, and I hope that will be the next step in expanding free GP care without means testing because they also need help.  As others have pointed out, it is not so much a case of the money and the relief, it is also the acknowledgement of what they do.<\/p> <p>I hope the resources will be put in place for GPs to provide this care because, as others have pointed out, we know there is an issue with a lot of GPs retiring and others closing their lists out of fear of not being able to provide a safe service because of the numbers they are increasingly being asked to cater for.  We need to attract back some of our younger doctors who have left this country.<\/p> <p>With regard to the contention of Senator Devine that universal healthcare was to privatise our health service, it certainly was not.  It was a realisation and recognition of where we are now and how the two systems are intermingled.  It was to allow those who cannot afford insurance to be supported by the Government to have insurance and have it paid for by the Government in many instances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I worked in the system for all of my adult life.  I know that hospitals see private patients as a resource and look upon public patients as a cost.  I will be criticised for saying what is true but it is the reality.  If a hospital is given a fixed budget, once that budget runs out, how is it supposed to look after people?  If we had a money-follows-the-patient system, which I was promoting and which had started, every patient who comes through the door would mean more income for the hospital, more support for staff and more resources to deal with the situation.  That is what we need.   We cannot continue with budgets that can be blindly broken without any regard for how many patients have been seen or treated and without any regard for whether those patients are the longest waiters or not.  <\/p><p>I want to come back to what is a very good news story, a very good day for carers and a day I hope will lead to more free GP care for all people on this island.  The next group we should be looking at in the budget is the other carers who are means tested.  The other groups, the over 70s, under sixes, those with cancer diagnoses and those with disabilities, are not means tested and that is right.  This group is entitled to the same consideration.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#W00300","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I join with others in welcoming the Bill.  It is a small but significant recognition of the work of care in our society and the fact that the care given in so many homes across Ireland is a contribution to the State and to our shared common good.  The State bears a responsibility to acknowledge and support carers in their work.  There are many positive elements in the Bill.  That is why it is passing with such speed through the House.  We will come to it at a later Stage but it is a positive step that those on the half-rate carer's allowance are likely to be included.<\/p> <p>I will further underline some of the concerns of those on the carer's support grant.  There is a practical question and a question of principles.  When the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced the beginning of the process last December, a cost of &euro;11 million was talked about.  Many people who were on the carer's allowance, because it was means tested, already qualified for the medical card, which has perhaps been what allowed those on the half-rate carer's allowance to come into the mix.  Might there not also be scope, even within this Bill, to include those in receipt of the carer's support grant?  If there is a space in what was originally envisaged fiscally, I urge the Minister of State to try to make it happen as it goes through the D&aacute;il.  We cannot table a money amendment ourselves.  <\/p> <p>It is really important for all the reasons that were mentioned but also because there are issues in the means testing.  There are issues around financial independence.  When a person gives up his or her work to care for another person, the fact that his or her partner may continue to work means there is money for the household but the person who is perhaps taking a decade out of his or her career to deliver care also needs financial independence and not simply income.  That is a concern I have about the adequacy of the carer's support grant.  This includes a level of independence.  People will not have to ask their partners for the money to visit a GP or to access prescriptions.  They will not be asking for that money.  People may seek to re-enter the workforce in their 40s or 50s and will have a capital basis for a restart.  We all know the efforts that restarting takes.  <\/p> <p>There is another related concern which I realise touches more on the area of social protection but it overlaps.  There are many who are caring in Ireland who are not having contributions made by virtue of the way in which they started caring.  There is a hole in our system whereby those who were not making social protection contributions before starting to care can sometimes not have contributions made on their behalf.  They face issues when re-entering at a later point and also in terms of pensions in the longer term.  <\/p> <p>I will touch briefly on another related issue.  I join with others in saying-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#X00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Senator is running into injury time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#X00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I am into my final time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#X00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone past it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070500002#X00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1530783000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>With my colleague, Senator Dolan, I had the opportunity to co-host a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Joint Committee on Education and Skills and Joint Committee on Health.

In the year when the Minister of State is ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which I applaud him for, we need to move towards emancipation as well as care.
