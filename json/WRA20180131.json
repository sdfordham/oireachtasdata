I also spoke in some detail about the Brexit negotiations. <\/p><p>I stressed the importance of our values and how we need to keep these to the fore as we respond to the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century. <\/p><p>I said that Europe needs a forward-looking agenda with ambition and direction. Rather than looking for great institutional changes, we should focus on implementing what we have already agreed. This should include completing the Single Market, the Digital Single Market, the Capital Markets Union and Banking Union, with a view to delivering concrete benefits for our citizens in areas that directly affect their lives.<\/p><p>I outlined Ireland's 'Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe' which I launched last November and which will run until 9 May, Europe Day. Our aim with this is to facilitate an open and wide-ranging debate with our citizens. <\/p><p>On Brexit, I highlighted the unique challenges this poses for Ireland. I thanked the European Parliament for its strong support and solidarity in the negotiations to date, and stressed the need to ensure that the commitments and principles agreed in December are translated into the Withdrawal Agreement. I also noted our ambition for a close and comprehensive future relationship between the EU and the UK. <\/p><p>In their interventions, MEPs reiterated their support for Ireland in relation to Brexit.  I welcome President Juncker's statement that &quot;we are all Irish&quot; as well as the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to propose continued PEACE funding beyond 2020. <\/p><p>In addition to the debate itself, I had a bilateral meeting with President Tajani. I thanked him for his support for Ireland in relation to Brexit. We exchanged views about the future of Europe, and I expressed appreciation for his initiative in bringing forward the series of debates in the European Parliament.<\/p><p>I also had a bilateral meeting with the European Parliament&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. We discussed developments since our last meeting in September and I expressed my sincere appreciation to Mr. Verhofstadt for his understanding and commitment to ensuring that Ireland's unique concerns are addressed.<\/p><p>I also attended a lunch hosted by the First Vice President of the Parliament, which was attended by party group leaders and other MEPs. <\/p><p>I met briefly and exchanged a few words with Commission President Juncker and the Head of the Brexit Task Force, Michel Barnier, although I did not have a formal bilateral meeting with either. <\/p><p>I had a short bilateral meeting with Commission Vice President Katainen in relation to Mercosur.

In relation to the 29 sites for which grant agreements\u00a0have been signed, and subject to completion of the planning process, the number of houses committed to be delivered on each site\u00a0will be\u00a0set out in\u00a0the following table.<\/p><p>Based on the information provided by the local authorities in their local agreements and analysis of current house prices in the areas concerned, and recognising\u00a0the commercial sensitivity around\u00a0some of the details in the agreements reached, the approved projects outside Dublin are\u00a0projected to have new homes for sale towards the lower end of the bands identified, while the projects in Dublin are\u00a0projected to have starter homes available towards the upper end of those bands.<\/p><p>Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund<table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Project name<\/th><th>Total Cost<\/th><th>Projected housing delivery by 2021<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>Claureen, Ennis<\/td><td>3.66<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>Old Whitechurch Road<\/td><td>9.89<\/td><td>600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>South Docks<\/td><td>15.50<\/td><td>620<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>Midleton (Water-rock)<\/td><td>5.50<\/td><td>520<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>Carrigaline<\/td><td>0.60<\/td><td>400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>Glanmire<\/td><td>5.90<\/td><td>300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>Dodder Bridge<\/td><td>15.75<\/td><td>1500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>Belmayne Clongriffin<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><td>850<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>Cherrywood<\/td><td>15.19<\/td><td>2000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>Clay Farm<\/td><td>4.70<\/td><td>350<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>Woodbrook Shanganagh<\/td><td>4.16<\/td><td>1242<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal<\/td><td>Donabate Distributor Road<\/td><td>15.50<\/td><td>1200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal<\/td><td>Oldtown Mooretown<\/td><td>4.90<\/td><td>800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal<\/td><td>Baldoyle Stapolin\u00a0<\/td><td>6.18<\/td><td>500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare\u00a0<\/td><td>Sallins<\/td><td>0.93<\/td><td>250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Naas<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Maynooth<\/td><td>14.50<\/td><td>800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>Ferrybank<\/td><td>0.62<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>Western Environs<\/td><td>6.76<\/td><td>530<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>Mungret<\/td><td>10.50<\/td><td>400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth\u00a0<\/td><td>Newtown Drogheda<\/td><td>1.22<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth\u00a0<\/td><td>Mount Avenue Dundalk<\/td><td>3.33<\/td><td>212<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>Ratoath<\/td><td>3.15<\/td><td>266<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>Farganstown, Navan<\/td><td>5.68<\/td><td>400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin<\/td><td>Kilcarbery \/ Corkagh Grange<\/td><td>4.39<\/td><td>1000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin<\/td><td>Clonburris SDZ<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><td>1000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council<\/td><td>Gracedieu<\/td><td>1.32<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council<\/td><td>Kilbarry<\/td><td>3.39<\/td><td>400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>Brawny Road, Athlone<\/td><td>1.83<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties Data","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[4579\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on the fact that certain Dublin local authorities have yet to list properties on their vacant site register;

Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.<\/p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on their vacant site registers in 2018.\u00a0 As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register, the registered owners of the sites in question and undertaking site valuations of the registered sites. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively 238 sites currently on the local registers. 219 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim.\u00a0 In the Dublin area, 98 sites will, as things stand, be subject to the levy in January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy, holding information seminars for local authorities on 25 May 2016 and 8 November 2017, and issuing a circular letter to planning authorities on the detailed arrangements in relation to  implementation of the levy on 1 July 2016.\u00a0 My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas and so that the full potential of the measure can be realised.<\/p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in Budget 2015, a public consultation was conducted by the Department of Finance on the issue of unused zoned and serviced land with a view to examining what taxation measures might be taken to penalise land owners who do not develop such land.\u00a0\u00a0On considering the outcome of the public consultation and further to the enactment of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, the Department of Finance determined that no new tax intended to encourage the development of residentially zoned and serviced land - separate to the vacant site levy - would be introduced at that time. <\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0as announced in the recent Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase will be tabled by way of Seanad amendment to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is presently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mayoral Election","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[4549\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans for a plebiscite on directly elected mayors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government includes a commitment to consider directly elected mayors in cities as part of a broader range of local government reform measures aimed at strengthening local democracy.\u00a0In response to this\u00a0commitment, a policy discussion report\u00a0on metropolitan governance for Ireland's cities\u00a0is at an\u00a0advanced stage of preparation.\u00a0At this point in time, I expect that this report will be submitted\u00a0to Government in the coming weeks, after which it will be sent to the Oireachtas for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  At its meeting of 26 September 2017, the Government agreed, as part of\u00a0an indicative\u00a0schedule for a number of referendums\u00a0over the next 18 months,\u00a0that a\u00a0plebiscite on directly elected\u00a0mayors would take place in\u00a0October 2018.\u00a0My Department is prioritising the drafting of the\u00a0legislation required to give effect to this decision and it is included in the Government's legislation programme as a Bill to be published in the first half of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[4601\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100065#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider promoting schemes of private serviced sites in all areas nationally on which first-time persons seeking homes for the first time could build their own homes to specific specifications as was the case in the past.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>Local\u00a0authorities already have powers to make\u00a0low-cost sites\u00a0available to\u00a0individuals,\u00a0who are qualified for social housing support,\u00a0and collectively,\u00a0to voluntary or co-operative not-for-profit housing associations. <\/p>  <p>  Separately,\u00a0I am providing funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, for a targeted programme, where the local authority will make low-cost serviced sites available to approved housing bodies or co-operative housing associations in specific areas for affordable housing. <\/p>  <p>  This approach has worked well in Ballymun between Dublin City Council and the O&rsquo;Cualann Co-Operative.

The on-going costs of these agreements are funded by my Department under the SHCEP. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, AHBs can direct lease dwellings from private owners, and subsequently enter into a P&amp;A agreement directly with a local authority to make that\u00a0dwelling available to that local authority for social housing purposes.

In the case of the acquisition or construction of apartment complexes, where there are service charges that would result in a net additional cost to the AHB, the availability payment may be set at up to 95% of market rent.

The scheme is delivered by local authorities who, under the RAS model, source accommodation from the private market and, in general, enter into a tenancy agreement with the landlord and the RAS recipient. AHBs can also contribute to the scheme; in some instances, an AHB may either lease a property directly\u00a0from a private owner and enter into a\u00a0RAS agreement with a local authority, or alternatively, an AHB may own the property and similarly make it available to the local authority for a RAS tenant,\u00a0under a\u00a0RAS contract with the local authority.\u00a0Where possible under RAS tenancies, as per guidelines set out by my Department, an 8% discount on market rent is secured on the basis of the\u00a0security of the RAS payment.\u00a0At end December 2016, there were 4,467 AHB tenancies existing under RAS.

It will outline a high-level, national vision for Ireland for 2040 and will provide the framework and principles to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years (catering for 1 million extra people, 600,000 extra jobs and over 500,000 extra homes).<\/p>  <p>  The forthcoming NPF is about empowering all areas to play their distinct roles in securing overall optimal national and regional development, and sets out a growth strategy to help achieve this.

However, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year, and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>  <p>  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution established a group of eminent international and regional experts to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights since September 2014.  In December 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights announced the names and appointment of its members.  The Group is expected to travel to Yemen soon and, as per the Resolution, will report back to the Human Rights Council in September of this year on its findings.

Once facilities are operational, payments to the PPP company are linked to service performance and availability of the facilities over the lifetime of the contract, with\u00a0deductions applying when the facilities are not performing or are unavailable.

I negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the new pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511. <\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales for public servants were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  The cost across the entire public service is estimated to be over &euro;200 million. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational supports to schools.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 was published in July 2016.  The Bill which passed Committee Stage on 28 June 2017 and will shortly proceed to Report Stage is an important piece of legislation which strives to create a new more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides an over-arching framework for greater transparency and consistency in school enrolment generally and thereby gives greater confidence to parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are legitimate, reasonable and fair.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill also contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of the Bill last June I indicated that I\u00a0intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and

It was decided that such payments would be offered to those persons whose cases were not statute barred prior to their proceedings being discontinued and where the person can demonstrate that their circumstances involved sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or post-primary school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the employee had previously worked) prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.<\/p><p>For the purposes of the settlement of litigation and the Government&rsquo;s <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme, there is no strict interpretation as to what constitutes a &ldquo;prior complaint.&rdquo;  The State must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was a prior complaint but the State does not insist on a strict evidential standard in assessing the material put forward by an applicant.  A holistic analysis of the case is undertaken and a flexible approach is adopted.<\/p><p>In assessing whether a settlement will be offered or whether an applicant comes within the <i>ex gratia <\/i>scheme, the State will consider instances of abuse which occurred in both primary and post-primary schools.  <\/p><p>In assessing a case or application, the State works on the basis that a prior complaint includes not only complaints made to teachers but also complaints made to any person(s) in authority in a school.  There are no time limits to the submitting of an application and if new evidence subsequently comes to light, even where an application had been declined, a further application can be submitted at any stage.<\/p><p>Following all of the above steps and consideration of all relevant materials, the SCA makes its decision on the ex-gratia scheme application.  <\/p><p>There has been consistent legal advice to the effect that the approach being taken by the State is legally sound.<\/p><p>While the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse has completed its work, allegations of abuse should always be referred to the appropriate authority for a full and proper investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100071#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100072#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[4737\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100072#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide additional accommodation for a school (details supplied) in County Donegal; the reason the school's application for additional accommodation was refused in view of its need for additional capacity due to growing numbers and overcrowding; the options open to the school to obtain approval of additional accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department received an application for the provision of additional accommodation at the school referred to in respect of\u00a0both classroom and ancillary accommodation.<\/p><p>When assessing the application it was noted that the existing school accommodation comprises of four mainstream classrooms, two Special Education Teaching (SET) rooms, a library\/computer room, staff room and a general office.

If the teacher was not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assisted with other work in their school such as administrative duties. <\/p>  <p>  A value for money review of the scheme was published in July 2006.

This reflected the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.\u00a0 Teachers assigned to &lsquo;base schools&rsquo; or as part of a &lsquo;cluster&rsquo; were often not available to schools within the cluster, due to the needs or decisions of the base school which retained control over the teaching resource.  In addition, teachers who were confined to a cluster were not available to schools outside of the cluster.  The scheme proved to be an inefficient use of resources and further restricted the number of teachers available for substitute work across the wider school system.   <\/p>  <p>  According to the value for money review, the more efficient and cost effective use of teaching resources is to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers \"on call\" in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a Teacher Supply Steering Group to develop a strategy for teacher supply.

There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division.<\/p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  <\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions including the DMR West Division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100075#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100075#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[4928\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100075#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; of each rank attached to each station (details supplied) in each of the past ten years.","asker":"1305","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[4929\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100075#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of probationary and newly commissioned garda&iacute; who have been deployed at stations (details supplied).","asker":"1305","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>Kevin Street and Kilmainham Garda Stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.)\u00a0South Central\u00a0Division, Ballyfermot forms part of the D.M.R.

South Division on 31 December 2017\u00a0was 532 with 20 Reserves and 36 Garda\u00a0civilian staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this\u00a0the Government\u00a0has put\u00a0in place a plan for\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom\u00a0141, 137 and 118 have been assigned to the D.M.R. South Central, D.M.R. West and D.M.R. South Divisions respectively. \u00a0I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net\u00a0increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to\u00a0maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce\u00a0to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.

I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><\/b><\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute;, by rank \u00a0attached to Crumlin, Kilmainham, Kevin Street and Ballyfermot \u00a0Garda Stations in each of the\u00a0years 2007 to 2017 and the number of probationer Garda&iacute;

The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-licence use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.

This includes additional funding to support the purchase of equipment and consumables for bariatric surgery in St Vincent's University Hospital which will provide the basis for provision of additional activity in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in respect of the particular issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100081#WRT02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100081#WRT02100"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[4955\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100081#WRT02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical appliance (details supplied) will be restored as an item covered by the medical card as was the position previously; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients.  Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, long-term illness and drugs payment schemes and the high tech arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme, MMP, review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

A cornerstone of the new scheme will be the provision of pathways for increased community ownership and participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects in line with the 2015 Energy White Paper commitments. Communities and citizens are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to underpin this ambition has been undertaken.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>One of the highest ranking community measures proposes a separate &lsquo;community-led&rsquo; category for projects that are initiated or majority owned by individuals or groups within the local community.

The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. Notwithstanding this, I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could\u00a0have an important role\u00a0in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon\u00a0economy,\u00a0in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of renewable energy projects right across the country. <\/p><p>In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders.\u00a0On foot of this workshop, I have asked the SEAI to conduct a\u00a0short study to assess the likely demand for and impact of micro generation among the public. \u00a0It is my intention to launch a grant aided pilot scheme this summer for solar PV micro generation initially targeted at self-consumption and for domestic properties. My Department will work with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. <\/p><p>Following on from the RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision,\u00a0a formal application\u00a0for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100083#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100083#WRV02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100083#WRV02500"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[4675\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100083#WRV02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if it is necessary for a motorist to wear a seat belt while driving when that motorist has a letter from their general practitioner stating that they are unable to wear a seat belt due to their medical condition.","asker":"1232","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>There is an exemption from the requirement to wear a seat belt where a person holds a certificate from a medical practitioner stating that they cannot wear a seat belt for medical reasons.<\/p><p>Information in respect of such an exemption\u00a0can be\u00a0found on the Road Safety Authority's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100083#WRV02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coast Guard Services","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100084#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[4716\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100084#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the Irish Coast Guard under the 2006 framework for a major emergency event, that is, whether it is a principal emergency service; and if so, the principal agency it falls under.","asker":"1217","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The Irish Coast Guard is designated as a principal emergency service under the\u00a0Framework for Emergency Management\u00a0and is part of the Irish Maritime Administration of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

On the other hand, the lower the target rate of return, the higher the contribution required will be.  The fundamental challenge of setting the investment strategy is balancing the need for adequate returns with the ability of the scheme to tolerate risk.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority has published guidelines for setting investment strategy for pension schemes.  These guidelines are based on the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations, 2006 made under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.

For the first time, this has given the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test. When deciding to extend access to this benefit to the self-employed, Government wanted to ensure that it was on a similar basis to that of those in employment.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  To qualify for IP a claimant must, inter alia, have at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete contribution year before the date of their claim.  Only PRSI classes A, E, H or S contributions are reckonable for IP purposes.  Class S contributions are those paid by self-employed people.<\/p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions paid by formerly self-employed people are not reckonable for IP; they are reckonable for State Pension Contributory, Guardian&rsquo;s Contributory Payment and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.<\/p>  <p>  A person who applied for Invalidity Pension in 2017 must have the required 260 paid PRSI contributions and also have 48 paid or credited class A, E, H, or S contributions in either 2015 or 2016 to meet the contribution conditions of the scheme.  This is a legislative requirement and contributions outside of the reference period cannot be assessed for the purposes of establishing the required 48 paid or credited contributions.<\/p>  <p>  The Department received a claim for IP for the gentleman concerned on the 29 December 2017.

According to the records of my Department, the person has a social insurance record of 1,688 reckonable contributions and credits during that period.  The person concerned is in receipt of the correct rate of contributory pension based on this social insurance record.  The person was notified in writing of their pension award on 31 January 2017.  Attached to that letter was a copy of their contribution record, as held by my Department and upon which their entitlement was calculated.  If the person concerned considers they have additional unrecorded contributions or credits, it is open to them to forward relevant documentary evidence and my Department will review their entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the person&rsquo;s Irish record, they have 522 recorded UK contributions for the tax years 1971\/72 to 1972\/73 and 1975\/76 to 1983\/84 inclusive.  The person&rsquo;s entitlement to a state pension (contributory) EU pro rata has also been examined.  As the person&rsquo;s entitlement to this pension is at a lower rate, the person concerned is financially better off on their existing (standard) state pension (contributory) and has been notified of this decision in writing on 21 August 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and a letter of clarification about the decision was issued to them on 26 September 2017.  If the person is not satisfied with the clarification they have received, they should contact the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Government announced proposals that pensioners who qualified for state pension (contributory) since September 2012, and whose rate of entitlement was impacted by the 2012 rate band changes, may apply for a review to have their entitlement considered under a new Total Contribution Approach (TCA).  It will take some time to draft and pass the necessary legislation, and then develop the systems and procedures necessary to administer the new pension entitlement option.  It is not necessary for any individuals to contact the Department at this juncture as the Department will contact them once the legislation, processes and systems have been developed.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has no function in decisions made in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters, including the revaluation of properties. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made in recent years. Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% have had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the revaluation programme advances.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent\u00a0valuation is well established and I have no plans to change this. However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century. My Department has developed\u00a0legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates. In this regard, the Government last year approved the drafting of a Rates Bill.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Board is independent in the performance of its functions, and as Minister, I have no role in the operational matters (including sampling and testing) pertaining to the implementation of the scheme.  The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie.<\/p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p><p>The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave. The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.<\/p><p>Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.<\/p><p>On foot of this recommendation of the Pyrite Panel, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol in 2013. The standard provides the means by which dwellings that may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised.<\/p><p>In late 2015, the NSAI commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.  The standard was updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years and was published on 4 August 2017.<\/p><p>I welcome the revised standard published by the NSAI and in this context I signed the Pyrite Resolution (Standard for Testing) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 556 of 2017) on 6 December 2017. These Regulations provide that pursuant to section 14(9)(a) of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, the &ldquo;standard for testing&rdquo; for the purpose of the Act shall be Irish Standard 398-1:2017 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash;Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, as published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 4 August 2017.<\/p><p>My Department is in regular contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency with regard to the implementation of the scheme. Any amendments, which the Board consider are required to the scheme as a result of the revised standard will be given full consideration should they be submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act.<\/p><p>The latest figures available indicate that a total of 1,963 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.Of the 1,963 applications received so far, 1,523 dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.<\/p><p>A further 110 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 218 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 112 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p><p>Of the 1,523 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme: 343 are at remedial works planning stage; 96 are at tender decision; 139 are under remediation; and 945 are complete.<\/p><p>With regard to funding, a sum of &euro;25 million was\u00a0expended on the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2017.  This funding facilitated the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings.<\/p><p>An increased amount\u00a0of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2018.  This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings this year and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the Pyrite Remediation Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners. Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100087#WRZ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":663,"content":"<p>Question No. 303 answered with Question No. 301.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Planning","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100088#WRAA00300"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[4715\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100088#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 656 of 23 January 2018, the legislation that underpins each of the principal response agencies and principal emergency services.","asker":"1217","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":666,"content":"<p>Local authorities are designated as Principal Response Agencies under the provision of the Framework for Major Emergency Management which was approved by Government decision in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities operate under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001\u00a0and other local government legislation including the Local Government (Reform) Act 2014.

Through releasing the value of their land, the cost of providing rental units can be reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers.  These providers could be Approved Housing Bodies or private entities.<\/p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of the Affordable Rental Scheme is to enhance the capacity of the rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Cost rental has similar objectives but is much broader in scope, with the model based on rents that reflect the cost of delivery of a home, rather than based on the prevailing market rent. Rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included. This provides greater certainty around the rent, regardless of what is happening in the market.<\/p>  <p>  The piloting of the Affordable Rental Scheme, by the Housing Agency and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council at Enniskerry Road, provides an opportunity to prove some of the key concepts underpinning cost rental more broadly, constituting a vital step in the longer-term objective of developing a cost rental option for the wider rental sector. The cost rental sector can provide accommodation in mixed-tenure developments for social tenants, who receive rent support, and other tenants who pay the full cost rent.<\/p>  <p>  I expect local authorities to be proactive in developing and bringing forward innovative concepts regarding the use of their land for the delivery of both affordable homes for purchase and rent.  Therefore, I have asked each local authority to furnish a report to me by mid-February, setting out their plans for delivery, especially those in main urban centres. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the timeline for delivery, like all publicly funded construction projects, the development of local authority sites for cost rental homes must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework and procurement rules, the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100088#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[4758\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100088#WRAA02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his definition of affordable rental housing, as announced in the Cork South Docks project in his statement on the affordable homes initiative on 22 January 2018; if in this model, the property at the end of 25 years will be returned to the ownership of the State or if it will be owned by the private developer; his views on whether this pilot project will be a model setting the standard for best practice in affordable rental provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>I have approved a Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) project for the South Docks in Cork City for the construction of road infrastructure and parks at a total cost of &euro;15.50 million.\u00a0 This public infrastructure will stimulate associated housing delivery of approximately 620 housing units by 2021 and it is expected that these apartments will be primarily for the rental market.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The LIHAF cost reduction element is currently structured around the provision of approximately 40 apartments for use by Cork City Council as part of an affordable rent scheme that they will develop, using a rent credit to provide affordable rent to persons nominated by Cork City Council\u00a0over a 25-year period.\u00a0 The homes will revert to the developer at the end of this period.\u00a0 <\/p><p>This model was developed specifically for the LIHAF project at South Docks and is being considered as a potential pilot approach\u00a0in\u00a0the context of providing affordable rental solutions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>As part of a\u00a0package\u00a0of initiatives announced earlier this month to help alleviate affordability pressures faced by households, I am proposing to develop a\u00a0new affordable rental scheme, to be based on a cost rental model.

It is for the management of the building to implement the design strategy for fire safety and put procedures in place, including procedures for evacuation of the building, where necessary in the event of fire, and to ensure that all building occupants are aware of the arrangements in place.<\/p>  <p>  In most buildings and circumstances, the safest approach and the default option is for all occupants of the building to evacuate in the event of fire or alarm.  Special provisions are necessary for buildings, such as hospitals or nursing homes, where evacuation of patients or residents may not be feasible or advisable.  Buildings containing flats are intended to have a degree of fire resistance, and in most circumstances fires won't spread further than one or two rooms beyond the room of origin.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of buildings containing flats, the current fire safety guidance provides for two-stage fire detection and alarm.  Firstly, each flat should be provided with its own internal domestic detection and alarm system, which gives an initial warning only within the flat when fire or smoke is detected.  The strategy is that residents should evacuate, closing doors behind them, in the event of fire or alarm in their own flat.  Secondly, for protection of the shared areas of the building, a fire detection and alarm system is provided to detect fire or smoke arising in the shared escape routes, or a developing fire in an individual flat which may begin to threaten the shared escape routes.  This second system will give warning to residents throughout the building.  Generally, where residents receive warning of a fire in the building, outside their own flat, they should evacuate the building. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of very large or high rise buildings containing flats, there is provision for the fire detection and alarm system to initially  warn the occupants in the areas of the building most likely to be affected by fire.  In this way, a phased evacuation can be provided for; this helps to minimise disruption and to avoid congestion where large numbers of people are using stairways at the same time.  Following the initial warning, the fire detection and alarm system can give warning in areas more remote from the fire. <\/p>  <p>  Residents of premises containing flats should be informed regarding the strategy and arrangements in place in their particular building. <\/p>  <p>  Where fire services attend a fire in a building containing flats, the Incident Commander may decide to instruct an evacuation of the building, or, where it is considered that a fire is small, with localised effects, and can be readily brought under control, they may advise residents to stay in place while the fire is brought under control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100090#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[4809\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100090#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the process for an inspection of a residential building by a fire engineer; and the specific details that are inspected.","asker":"1301","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>Under section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed on the 'person having control' of each building, for example a Management Company in an apartment complex. <\/p>  <p>  Inspections of buildings may be undertaken for many reasons and by many parties.

The review involved discussions\u00a0with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.\u00a0 The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by\u00a0a special\u00a0delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017,\u00a0came into effect on 1 January 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in\u00a0the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017,\u00a0that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial\u00a0support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.  <\/p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): <\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes\u00a0has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231.  An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has\u00a0increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.  <\/p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes\u00a0has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.  <\/p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example,\u00a0as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: <\/p>  <p>  There has been\u00a0an increase in the level of\u00a0volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is\u00a0recoupable, from 60% to 85%.

Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in Exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes\u00a0will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment.  Significant progress has been made in increasing the build programmes of local\u00a0authorities and approved housing bodies and there are over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, which is being added to on a weekly basis.  <\/p><p>With the funding made available in Budget 2018,\u00a0the aim is to meet the housing needs of almost 25,500 households during 2018.  Central to this delivery will be the construction of 3,800 new homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, through direct build, turnkey developments, rapid delivery and regeneration programmes.  This construction programme underpinned by a multifaceted Action Plan\u00a0is, I believe, the correct way to make a fast and sustainable response to the housing crises.  <\/p><p>The Social Housing Construction Status Reports, which I now publish quarterly,\u00a0provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area.  The last published report,\u00a0which sets out\u00a0the position at the end of September 2017, shows that there were over 3,600 new social\u00a0homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase.  That report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.  <\/p><p>It will be these schemes that will form the\u00a0bulk of\u00a0the housing starts and delivery of the 3,800 homes targeted through new builds in 2018.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authorities and approved housing bodies.  However, my Department is working closely with the local authorities on delivery, including through a new Delivery Office and through quarterly meetings to address challenges and\u00a0delays that can and\u00a0do arise with individual projects.  <\/p><p>Through these contacts, my Department\u00a0working with the local authorities and approved housing bodies, is ensuring that the necessary\u00a0quantum of projects is in place to meet our 2018 construction delivery targets.  Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed and these will also form part of the delivery for 2018 and beyond.  <\/p><p>My Department does not\u00a0hold comprehensive information on the planning\u00a0process in the case of all social housing construction projects\u00a0as this is a matter for the local authority.

However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments,\u00a0including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the\u00a0Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Misunderstanding of the scheme is often to blame for discrimination and it highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents.<\/p>  <p>  In order to highlight the benefits of HAP and to provide information on the scheme to interested parties, my Department has taken a number of targeted communications actions during 2017, including the provision of a\u00a0dedicated HAP website which provides prospective HAP landlords and tenants with the information they need to understand how the HAP scheme works.\u00a0 Local authorities are promoting the scheme locally, and engaging with letting agents and landlords who might be interested in entering into a HAP tenancy, while my Department is promoting the scheme by engaging directly with landlord representative bodies and fora.<\/p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.  The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service, with effect from 19 January 2018, can now be made available in each of the 31 local authorities.\u00a0 All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The day-to-day operation of the HAP scheme is a matter for individual Local Authorities.  My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications\u00a0or\u00a0payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord\u00a0is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC)\u00a0manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.\u00a0 Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p>  <p>  Over\u00a032,000 eligible households are currently being supported\u00a0through HAP,\u00a0with over 20,000 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme and receiving housing assistance payments.  HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long term housing needs immediately their need arises.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In\u00a0general,\u00a0I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100092#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100092#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[4916\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100092#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on the proposal that developers would only be granted planning permission if houses have electric car charging points inserted from the outset.","asker":"1294","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>I am aware of proposals by the European Commission to amend Directive 2010\/31\/EU on the energy performance of buildings, on which discussions are ongoing at EU level.\u00a0\u00a0Under the\u00a0draft amendments to the\u00a0Directive, it is proposed to\u00a0introduce requirements for the installation of vehicular charging points on new and existing non-residential buildings undergoing major renovation, and\u00a0 also incorporates proposals in relation to new and existing residential buildings.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will implement the provisions of the final Directive when it is adopted and published.

The focus of Part V is currently on the delivery of social housing only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100092#WREE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":779,"content":"<p>Question No. 347 answered with Question No. 341.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":781,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 348 to 350, inclusive, answered with Question No. 338.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":782,"content":"<p>Question No. 351 answered with Question No. 335.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development Policy","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100093#WRFF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[4964\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100093#WRFF00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will expand on his plans for regional and balanced development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[4965\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018013100093#WRFF00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which he expects to positively influence measures to encourage population movement throughout the country thereby reducing congestion in the bigger population counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":786,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together.<\/p><p>The National Planning Framework (NPF), titled\u00a0Ireland 2040 - Our Plan,\u00a0will set a new long-term strategic planning and investment context for Ireland over the next 20 years. \u00a0It will\u00a0outline a high-level, national vision for Ireland for 2040 and will provide the framework and principles to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years (catering for 1 million extra people, 600,000 extra jobs and over 500,000 extra homes).<\/p><p>The forthcoming NPF will empower all areas to play their distinct roles in securing overall optimal national and regional development, and sets out a growth strategy to help achieve this.\u00a0 In doing so, the NPF presents a long-term framework that sets out how Ireland can move away from the &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; pattern of development.<\/p><p>In setting out a context for targeting future growth, the Framework seeks to enable a co-ordinated and plan-led, rather than development-led, approach to development across Ireland.\u00a0The NPF identifies the need for a strategic strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s overall urban structure, building on\u00a0the recently published ESRI research paper, titled\u00a0Prospects for Irish Regions and Counties: Scenarios and Implications.
