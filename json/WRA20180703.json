I welcome this move towards a more humane practice of border protection and immigration control. <\/p>  <p>  I very much hope that we have seen the last of this unwarranted practice and the priority now must be reuniting all of the affected children with their parents, without delay. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300069#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300069#WRC00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Staff","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300069#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[28699\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300069#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of customs officers that are employed by each port here in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>See the following table:<table><tr><th>Port<\/th><th>Number  of Staff<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Airport<\/td><td>118<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Port<\/td><td>85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shannon Airport<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rosslare Port<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork Port \/Airport<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It should be noted that Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on customs.

The local public banks in Germany are called Sparkassen. The structure of the local public banking system means that these Sparkassen are not permitted to operate outside particular, specified geographic areas. The philosophy of local public banking is not profit maximisation. Instead, Sparkassen aim to promote the development of the local, regional economy of the area in which they operate. An important aspect of the business model of Sparkassen is building relationships and working closely with the SMEs located in their regional area. <\/p>  <p>  A thorough consideration of the potential for local public banking in Ireland, based on the Sparkassen model, has been carried out by officials in my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work included a public consultation exercise, engaging with stakeholders and interested parties, as well as an analysis of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. Consideration of the proposal of how the German model of local public banking could be implemented in Ireland included a number of meetings between officials from both departments and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC. <\/p>  <p>  The report on local public banking has now been completed. Minister Ring and I circulated the report to all Government departments for comments and observations and it was jointly brought to Government at a Cabinet meeting in May.

While a number of the recommendations in the Motor Report are relevant to the area of business insurance &ndash; in particular, the recommendations regarding the Book of Quantum, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; it became clear in preparing the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance  that there was also a pressing need to examine the drivers for the rising cost of business insurance.  <\/p>  <p>The second phase work culminated in the publication on January 25 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, following its approval by Government.  This new Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, detailed in an Action Plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. <\/p>  <p>  The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:<\/p>  <p>- Increase Transparency:  enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes,<\/p>  <p>- Review the level of damages in personal injury cases:  request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, and<\/p>  <p>- Improve the personal injuries litigation framework:  through a number of measures, including: <\/p>  <p>a.  ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; <\/p>  <p>b.  tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and <\/p>  <p>c.  ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the Judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.<\/p>  <p>All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.

Louth, and recognise the serious threat that fuel fraud poses to legitimate business, consumers and the Exchequer.  I am advised by Revenue that tackling fuel fraud has been one of their priorities over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  While it is very disappointing that incidents such as this still occur, I am advised that the level of such activity is greatly reduced.  I am advised by Revenue that a total of 100 intermediate bulk containers of mineral oil waste have been detected to date in 2018, in Co. Louth.  A further 18 containers were found in Co. Monaghan, but these have been classified as historical dumps that had been previously undiscovered.  These figures compare positively when set against 500 intermediate bulk containers that were detected in 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned improvement reflects the success Revenue has had in tackling this problem and the impact of legislative changes that I and my predecessor introduced over a number of Finance Acts to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers in tackling fraud in the fuel sector.  The measures implemented by Revenue to tackle the problem included the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud.  It also included a rigorous programme of enforcement action by Revenue.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing the problem in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past couple of years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a random National Sampling Programme in 2016 and 2017, to assess the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested. <\/p>  <p>  Although the available evidence to date indicates that the new marker cannot be laundered by conventional methods, I am advised by Revenue that it remains vigilant.  A further sampling programme in 2018 was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector as well as auto fuel traders.  Data from this sampling programme is currently under analysis.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud has delivered significant success, that Revenue is alert to the resourcefulness of those involved in fuel fraud, and that appropriate action in this area continues to be a high priority.  I will fully consider any additional proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300070#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300070#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[29030\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300070#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 161 of 19 June 2018, his views on whether it is acceptable for the Central Bank to refuse to confirm the costs incurred to date in respect of the inquiry; if these costs and the estimate of the total costs will be confirmed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Central Bank that it believes that the release of the costs of the Inquiry at this stage has the potential to prejudice the effectiveness of the INBS Inquiry. <\/p>  <p>  The Inquiry is currently hearing the first module which is the first module of four, and which has been ongoing since late December 2017.

All 16 Vote groups with capital expenditure are below profile.  The main driver of this underspend is the Housing, Planning and Local Government Vote, which is &euro;157 million, or 35.4%, below profile.

As outlined in the Summer Economic Statement, published last month, the Government is determined to ensure that the budgetary strategy is based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenues.  To deliver on this objective it is essential that expenditure increases to deliver improvements in services are affordable and sustainable over the medium-term.  This will require prioritisation and realism in the allocation of resources and a focus on the extent to which public spending is delivering on key policy objectives.<\/p>  <p>  As such, as the economy has recovered, Government has provided for increases in public expenditure in recent years.  While increases in expenditure have impacted broadly across all sectors, a particular focus has been placed on ensuring the areas of Health, Housing, Education and Social Protection are sufficiently funded to support the Government&rsquo;s social goal for a fairer and more inclusive society.  <\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that these additional resources are managed in a prudent and efficient manner by each Government Minister and Department.  Therefore, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in regular contact with all Government Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is reporting to Government on expenditure levels.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles and this information is published each month with the Exchequer Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity.  In this context, the Government has set out its vision for Ireland over the medium term through the publication of Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan.  With this plan, investment levels in Ireland will continue to increase at a sustainable rate and modern public infrastructure will be delivered over the coming years which will improve the lives of people throughout Ireland and allow our companies and economy to continue to compete in a globalised world.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is also important that we continue to reform and enhance the way public services are delivered.  This can be achieved by applying management accountability, raising efficiency, technological progress and other means.  By better aligning inputs with outputs, we can ensure better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money and improve the efficiency with which these monies are allocated.  The spending review, which will be published in July, will be critical in this regard by supporting an evidence based approach to policy, and helping to ensure the consistent evaluation of existing expenditure through systematic reviews of expenditure programmes across all sectors of Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300071#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300072#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[29380\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300072#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which each or all Departments remain compliant with his Department&rsquo;s guidelines in regard to procurement and reform with the objective of achieving the best result for the economy and the taxpayer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>Public Procurement is governed by EU legislation and National rules and guidelines.

In this regard, the OGP has developed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which consists of 5 strands:<\/p>  <p>  - Legislation (Directives, Regulations)<\/p>  <p>  - Government Policy (Circulars, etc.)<\/p>  <p>  - Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works<\/p>  <p>  - General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services<\/p>  <p>  - More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the OGP<\/p>  <p>  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  The framework supports contracting authorities, including the OGP, the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for works, goods and services.  It enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their Public Procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.<\/p>  <p>  Last July, my colleague Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, Minister of State with special responsibility for Public Procurement, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that while the OGP guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP supports compliance by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the OGP's Key Account Managers are in regular contact with Procurement Officers in Government Departments and State Bodies to assist, support and remind them of their obligations in relation to public procurement.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred.

Minister Bruton is meeting with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) later this week to discuss the report and its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Securing skills supply from the education and training to the construction sector is a major focus of my Department as part of broader Government actions to increase housing supply and roll out the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework. Construction related apprenticeship registrations increased from 1,713 in 2015 to 2,314 in 2016 which represents an increase of 35%. This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963 which represented over 60% of all new registrations last year.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS and the Apprenticeship Council are reviewing pathways to apprenticeship.  The review report, due to be published shortly, will identify barriers that exist to participation in apprenticeship programmes and make recommendations for the future.  This may include looking at support for employers taking on apprentices from under-represented groups and practical support for smaller employers engaging with the apprenticeship system.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the recommendations contained in the CIF report refer to changes to the NTF levy to employers. As part of Budget 2018, it was decided to raise the rate of the NTF levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8% and, subject to progress on a series of reforms, by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020.  One of these reforms is a comprehensive and independent review of the National Training Fund (NTF) to guide strategic decisions on its structure and future direction in order to inform Budget 2019. This review will be completed shortly. It should be noted that most schemes internationally that allow rebates for employers who train directly only apply where that training is provided and funded by the employer.  There are issues with a proposal that employers who benefit most from investment from the NTF contribute less than other employers to the levy.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that employers engaged in craft based apprenticeships are benefitting significantly from the National Training Fund (NTF) as the apprentices in these programmes are paid a training allowance equivalent to their wages by their local Education and Training Board during their off-the-job training phases. This is not the case in the new consortia-led apprenticeships where the employer pays the apprentice's wage for the full duration of the apprenticeship. Further financial assistance to employers in the construction sector needs to be considered in that context.  This year &euro;122m has been allocated from the NTF to apprenticeship training, an increase of almost 24% on the previous year. <\/p>  <p>  I am very interested in exploring mechanisms of supporting smaller employers to engage with the apprenticeship system and considering further some of the recommendations in the CIF report. Work is already underway on developing a the shared  apprenticeship scheme.  SOLAS in partnership with CIF and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB) operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of such a scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.

In order to ease the situation, in the last school year I suspended the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes.

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.<\/p>  <p>   Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two-scale-point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.  That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.  Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.  Further engagement is being arranged as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue. <\/p>  <p>  In the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (issued in December 2007), the Body evaluated the pay and jobs of 109 grades across the public service, including school Principals.  The Body recommended pay increases for 15 grades, including changes to the allowance payable to Principals of primary schools and of small post-primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the PSBB would be paid as follows: <\/p>  <p>  (a) 5% from 1 September 2008, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date; <\/p>  <p>  (b) The issue of the payment of any balances will be discussed between the parties in the context of any successor to this Transitional Agreement which might be agreed between the Social Partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of this Transitional Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State&rsquo;s worsening financial circumstances.  In line with current Government policy, there are no plans to implement the recommendations set out in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body as they apply to any public servant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300075#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300075#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[29246\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300075#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the National Council for Special Education will have finalised the form for assistant technology to allow it to pass on an application by a person (details supplied) to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>Under the Assistive Technology scheme, as set out in my Department's Circular 0010\/2013, funding is provided to schools towards the cost of computers and specialist equipment, which are required for educational purposes.

Included in the submissions received was a 97 page submission from a specially-constituted committee of the judiciary.<\/p>  <p>  Following a commitment in the Programme for Government 2016 regarding a new Judicial Appointments Commission with an independent chair and lay majority, and taking into account the submissions received, a Scheme of a  Bill was published in December 2016 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2017.  The Scheme, significantly modified following issues which arose in the pre-legislative process, was published as a Bill on 30th May 2017 and has since been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is awaiting Committee Stage in the other House which is scheduled today.<\/p>  <p>  GRECO recently produced a Fourth Round Evaluation Draft Interim Compliance Report in relation to Ireland on 11 June 2018 for adoption at the GRECO 80th Plenary meeting held in Strasbourg on 18-22 June.  This Report had been produced in earlier draft in 2017 and Ireland had been given the opportunity to comment on its conclusions.  In relation to the Judicial Appointments Bill that report concluded that the 2014 GRECO recommendation in relation to judicial appointments legislation remained unimplemented, despite a formal Bill having been published and advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  GRECO had also received correspondence from the Irish Judiciary which was critical of the Judicial Appointments Bill both in terms of their view that there had not been adequate consultation in relation to the Bill and their consistent opposition to the proposed composition of the new Commission as regards the appointment of a lay chairperson and lay majority and the number of judges on the Commission.  I very much welcome the fact that the Judiciary were in a position to express their views independently to GRECO and I understand that GRECO themselves also welcomed this.<\/p>  <p>  GRECO, in this draft compliance report, expressed significant concerns regarding the proposed composition of the new Commission, in particular that a minority of judges and a strong lay representation (including the chairperson), is not in line with European standards.  This conclusion was based on a Recommendation of the Council of Europe from 2010, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2012, which among other things recommended a judicial appointments body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  My senior officials attended the GRECO plenary meeting in Strasbourg on 18-22 June and explained that Ireland would strongly question a view that the presence of the Chief Justice (as head of the Supreme Court) and the four other Presidents of Courts on the new Commission is anything other than a body &lsquo;drawn in substantial part from the judiciary.&rsquo;  It was also explained that Ireland respectfully disagrees with the suggestion in the Report that Ireland is not in line with European standards in this regard since the  Council of Europe Recommendation relied on does not equate the term &lsquo;substantial part&rsquo; to a majority of judges or, indeed, half of the membership of such a body.  It was also pointed out that the 2010 Recommendation itself specifies, in relation to countries which have judicial appointments bodies where the body both selects and appoints judges, that those bodies should be made up &lsquo;at least half&rsquo; of judges, thus not specifying a majority even in that case. It was also pointed out to the GRECO meeting that the 2010 Recommendation of the Council of Europe also sets specifically that the membership of judicial selection authorities should ensure the widest possible representation and that this is one of the reasons why the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 provides for a large cohort of lay members, carefully and independently selected according to very specific skills and experience criteria, by the Public Appointments Service.  I understand that, following that meeting, GRECO has incorporated amendments to the Interim Compliance Report.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I might also point out, as was indicated to GRECO, that there are no internationally binding norms in relation to the composition of judicial selection bodies.  Other recommendations have been made or formal views expressed in this area including in the ENCJ (European Network of Councils for the Judiciary) Dublin Declaration (2012) which stated that: &ldquo;The procedures for the recruitment, selection or (where relevant) promotion of members of the judiciary ought to placed in the hands of a body independent of government in which a relevant number of members of the judiciary are directly involved and that the membership of this body should comprise a majority of individuals independent of government influence.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01300"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[28874\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) has recently taken up residence here having been refused access to the UK; and the measures being taken to stop racist and fascist organisers from setting up here.","asker":"1279","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>It is not the practice to comment on the details of an individual case such as this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the European Directive (2004\/38\/EC) on the free movement of EU citizens and their family members is transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015. The Regulations provide that an EU citizen who is in possession of his or her national identity card or passport may not be refused permission to enter Ireland unless it would be contrary to public policy or would endanger public security to grant him or her permission to enter the State. Restrictions on the right of residence of EU citizens may be imposed on similar grounds.<\/p>  <p>  The Directive provides that measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security must comply with the principle of proportionality and must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the person concerned. The Directive states that previous criminal convictions shall not, in themselves, constitute grounds for taking such measures. However, a previous criminal record would, where known by the immigration authorities, be a relevant factor in determining whether to permit a person to enter the State as the person could constitute a genuine threat to public policy or public security.<\/p>  <p>  It is, of course, the case that all persons entering and in the State are required to abide by the laws of the State and in circumstances where they engage in criminal conduct they are liable to investigation and prosecution in respect of that conduct.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the general criminal law and targeted legislation, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, have application for the purpose of protection from racist, xenophobic or other hate attacks. It is an offence to propagate views that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended to, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Traveller community or sexual orientation. Accordingly prosecutions may be brought under the Act where intention to incite hatred is proven or where the likelihood of stirring up hatred is proven regardless of intention.<\/p>  <p>  I would note for the Deputy that the National Strategy for Migrant Integration includes a number of actions to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia.  It includes an action to review the current legislation on racially motivated crime with a view to strengthening the law. It also intends to address the issue of under-reporting of racially motivated crime. It is a Whole-of-Government Strategy, in which all branches of Government work together to make our integration vision a reality. That vision is that migrants are facilitated to play a full role in Irish society, that integration is a core principle of Irish life, and that Irish society and institutions work together to promote integration fully. Promoting intercultural awareness and combatting racism is key to achieving this.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities. GNDIU monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. There are currently a total of 247 Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) appointed to work with minority communities at local level. These officers play a fundamental role in liaising with minority communities and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities and to help prevent hate and racist crime. The GRIDO and ELO's provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also ratified and continues to implement the International UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This year, Ireland will submit its combined Fifth to Seventh periodic reports to the UN Committee. It is due to be approved by the Government shortly and will be transmitted to the UN thereafter. The report has undergone a comprehensive consultation process with civil society and government agencies, and Ireland looks forward to examination by the Committee, to update them on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing positive progress to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems Provision","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[28935\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if extra assistance is available for poorer communities that wish to apply for the recently announced funding to install CCTV but cannot raise the matching funding required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has launched a community-based CCTV grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.

Asylum seekers will have access to additional means to provide for themselves and their families outside of the State&rsquo;s directly provided services and supports while their application is being determined.  Moreover, Ireland is one of the few EU Member States to allow eligible asylum seekers to also engage in self-employment.<\/p><p>Our accommodation centres will now be put on a statutory basis and an applicant with sufficient earnings may choose to provide their own accommodation in the future.  For those who will be granted protection, this will of course assist their early integration into our society and communities.  For those who are found not to have a protection need, it provides an opportunity to receive an income, which will help them in their reintegration to their home country to rebuild their lives there.<\/p><p>In May 2017, the Supreme Court found that an absolute ban on the right to seek employment for asylum seekers, where there was no time limit in the decision making process, was unconstitutional.  The Government availed of this opportunity to broaden the scope of reform required and committed Ireland, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to opting-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive 2013, thereby aligning our position with EU norms and standards.  The Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants while their application is being determined.  Under the Directive, asylum seekers will have access to the labour market nine months from the date when their protection application was lodged, if they have yet to receive a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office and have cooperated with the process.<\/p><p>Eligible applicants may apply to the Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), for a labour market permission (which covers both employment and self-employment).

Once a family is resettled in a community, an implementing partner procured by the local authority provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.  The implementing partner plays a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through their expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both managed under the auspices of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is coordinated overall by the IRPP, but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities source accommodation for refugees, mainly refugee families, according to a distribution key that takes account of a number of factors, including population size and housing need within the local authority area.

It involves insidious and coercive behaviour directed at forcing compliance of another person against their will.  The intimidation can be either explicit or implicit, involving actual, threatened or perceived threats of violence to a person or damage to property.<\/p>  <p>  The threat of violence to enforce drug debt impacts people's lives greatly and creates an atmosphere of fear within communities, particularly those where there is a concentration of illicit drug markets.  In many instances, such communities are already marginalised and are also having to contend with social and public disorder and other forms of criminality associated with the illicit drugs trade.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will stress that whether or not a family or loved one has paid these debts, this should not be a deterrent to seeking their help, advice and support.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take action in relation to drug related intimidation, particularly where there is a risk of harm, or to the life of a person.<\/p>  <p>  The problem of drug debt intimidation has been highlighted in the current and previous national drug and alcohol strategies.  Under the 2009 &ndash; 2016 Strategy, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the National Family Support Network developed \"The Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme\" to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing such intimidation.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new strategy \"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025\", the issue is again signalled for further action.  In 2018, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be carrying out an evaluation of the Programme to strengthen its effectiveness and, if appropriate, to develop measures to raise public awareness of the Programme.  The National Family Support Network, who worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop the Programme, will also be carrying out their own evaluation from the perspective of their network.  Both of these evaluations are underway and I look forward to hearing the outcome of them.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Reporting Programme, an Inspector has been selected in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation.  These Inspectors are management level personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who liaise directly with their local Superintendent in relation to each individual case.  Persons seeking the assistance of the Inspector in their area may contact him or her to arrange to meet either formally or informally. It is also possible for a person to ask a local family support worker or drugs worker to contact the Inspector for their area, or to ask the National Family Support Network to do so. If anyone experiences difficulty contacting the relevant inspector they can contact the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The contact details for all Garda Inspectors nominated under the Programme are available on the Garda website.<\/p>  <p>  In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost regard to the safety and the most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat, the best level of security, advice and support.  Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the Programme.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific information sought in relation to the numbers of reports received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, the resources, training and funding provided to it and the delivery of seminars and briefings to local Garda Management, I have requested a report from the Acting Garda Commissioner in each of these respects, with specific reference to the position in County Louth.<\/p>  <p>  When this report is to hand I will respond further to the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[29063\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the actions and investigations being undertaken on foot of the report of the Moriarty tribunal; the status of these investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[29064\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the status of the investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions into the findings of the Flood and Mahon tribunals; the stage these investigations are at; when he expects a decision to be reached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[29065\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the status of investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions into the findings of the Moriarty tribunal; the stage these investigations are at; when he expects a decision to be reached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 to 235, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I have requested an update from the Garda authorities in relation to the progress of the investigations and I will contact the Deputy directly when that update is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL05200"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[29080\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300077#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out in tabular form the number of garda&iacute; by rank and division in County Louth.","asker":"1333","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Louth Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 312. There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Louth Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 76 to the Louth Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

At the time I responded that I would request the information sought by you from the Garda Commissioner and that I would write directly to you on receipt of same.  This response has now issued to your office but by way of assistance I include the substantive response below.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there is no dedicated Mental Health Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use an interagency response to deal with people with mental health issues and in this regard there is a Memorandum of Understanding between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is referred to when Garda&iacute; are dealing with mental health incidents.  The Memorandum of Understanding is a joint initiative by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE to maximise interagency co-operation and to promote the welfare and safety of persons with mental ill health.  In addition, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also use the on call doctor service when dealing with such incidents.<\/p>  <p>  Further, section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which provides for Garda powers to take persons believed to be suffering from a mental disorder into custody, may be invoked by the Garda&iacute; where they come into contact with a mentally ill person in a crisis situation.  In such situations, it may appear that the person is a danger to himself\/herself or to others.  Section 12 may be invoked to ensure that a medical assessment and admission to an approved centre and treatment in accordance with that Act are accessed.<\/p>  <p>  The Memorandum of Understanding between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE has been developed in order to provide an appropriate response in respect of the removal or return of persons to approved centres in accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE are the key agencies empowered by law to carry out these functions.  Mutual understanding and cooperation is essential in ensuring that these roles are carried out effectively.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that during Phase 1 of the Applied Policing Programme, Trainee Garda&iacute; are exposed to and challenged with the issues surrounding vulnerable persons suffering from mental illness.<\/p>  <p>  The training programme is delivered using a problem based learning approach (PBL) and includes a module on Policing with the Communities.  As part of this module under Unit 5 - Mental Illness Awareness, trainees focus on the area of the elderly and mental illness and look at areas such as types of mental illness, Garda powers and procedures and transportation of persons with a medical illness.  It also contains information on the various community and social services involved in the area.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that in addition to this and as part of the BA programme, the trainees attend a 2 day internationally recognised ASIST suicide prevention programme which is co-delivered with the HSE.  The ASIST programme is a suicide first aid programme which equips students with the skills required to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce the immediate risk of suicide.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2014 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Continuous Professional Development Core Programme for operational members, provided training on Mental Illness Awareness in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001.  The programme also covered areas of the types of mental illness, Garda powers and procedures and transportation of persons with a mental illness.  This topic will be included in the Core Programme for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The vulnerability of suspects, witnesses and injured parties is also embedded in all training courses for Investigative Interviewing with Level 3 Investigative Interviewing addressing the area of memory through the use of enhanced cognitive interview skills.  The areas of personality disorders and mental health are also covered on these training courses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":634,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 243 to 248, inclusive, answered with Question No. 231.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[29154\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if additional resources will be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Louth division to support the establishment of a drugs and organised crime unit in the Dundalk area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Further, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Louth Division on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 312, of whom 4 were allocated to the Divisional Drug Unit.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Louth Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 the Commissioner established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources he needs to allow him to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[29190\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300078#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the review being undertaken by officials of the Irish Prison Service and his Department in consultation with the Attorney General examining the necessary legislative and-or administrative changes arising from the ruling in a case (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>In July 2016 the Supreme Court dismissed the State's appeal in the case of O'Farrell, McDonald, Rafferty -v- The Governor of Portlaoise Prison.

In 2008, the IPS established a dedicated team of officers who have sole responsibility for preventing the flow of contraband into prisons.  The Operational Support Group (OSG) operate the security screening areas that are now located at the point of entry of all closed prisons.

In addition to the establishment of the OSG, the installation of nets over exercise yards, enhanced CCTV monitoring, the stricter control of visits and the use of targeted and random cell searches on a daily basis has reduced the availability of contraband.  The introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines has also helped efforts to tackle the problem.

Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. <\/p>  <p>  Approval and funding has been provided for the posts required to facilitate this service expansion and recruitment is currently being progressed by local management and the HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service.

I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019. <\/p>  <p>  When I met with South East Oireachtas members on 14 February last, I indicated that I would give some consideration to the various issues raised by the group, including the potential for the deployment of a modular cath lab, as an interim solution, pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.

The ability to identify and trace animals is critical from an animal health, food safety and animal welfare perspective.  The current system was introduced in 2010.  The system is complex, with multiple and different scenarios associated with the movement\/trading of sheep &ndash; necessitating a 44 page Step by Step Guide published by the Department.  The current system necessitates the manual transcription of a series of individual lengthy tag numbers at each point of transaction along the supply chain &ndash; which provides significant ongoing challenge in the context of an effective traceability system. <\/p>  <p>  The main benefits of the new arrangements can be summarised as relating to reduced complexity associated with tag types and retagging of animals, readable and accurate records, and reduced administrative burden for farmers.  It will critically improve industry and the State's capacity to effectively respond &ndash; in a timely, targeted, focused and accurate way - to critical animal health and food safety incidents\/events.  It also facilitates DAFM, acting on behalf of the industry, in engaging more proactively in seeking and achieving new market access for Irish sheep and sheep meat products.  <\/p>  <p>  Hence, the new rules will provide a more robust sheep traceability system and will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry as detailed in the Food Wise 2025 Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept that additional costs will accrue to farmers in extending EID to all sheep.  In that context I announced the introduction of a one off support measure up to a maximum of &euro;50 per keeper for the first purchase of EID tags.  Electronic tag readers and associated software are included as eligible investments in the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) scheme to assist sheep farmers in flock management.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials and I have met with a number of the stakeholders in the sheep industry since I announced the new rules on 2 May.

Our commercial ports, however, differ greatly in size, capability and future potential.  The long-term international trend in ports and shipping is toward increased consolidation of resources in order to achieve optimum efficiencies of scale.  Therefore the core objective of National Ports Policy (NPP) is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services.  National Ports Policy introduces a clear categorisation of the ports based on tonnage and the clear potential to provide future port capacity.  <\/p>  <p>  It is already evident that larger vessels requiring greater depths are becoming the norm, necessitating greater investment in ports.  There is no Exchequer funding available for infrastructural development but the Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) are required to lead the response to future national port capacity requirements, as the development of large scale port infrastructure requires significant organizational, operational and financial resources.  There is also a role in this regard for the Ports of National Significance (Tier 2) to develop additional capacity to aid competitive conditions, within the unitised sectors in particular.  <\/p>  <p>  National Ports Policy provides that the Ports of Regional Significance retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.  <\/p>  <p>  Similarly at a European level the planning, development and operation of trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) contribute to the attainment of major EU objectives, including contributing to further economic growth and competitiveness in a global perspective as set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Commission White Paper entitled \"Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area &ndash; Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system\" (\"the White Paper\").

Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest.  The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port;  however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.  <\/p>  <p>  Following that assessment, my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.

I am engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department is not an employer of early years educators. While my Department is a significant funder of childcare services, recognised employer and employee groups are the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the early years sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector. <\/p>  <p>  Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders. It should be highlighted that my Department would have no role in relation to the SEO process, but, as a significant funder and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.

This additional investment is helping to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done. The announcement in Budget 2018 that we will increase ECCE capitation rates by 7% from September 2018 is intended to support the childcare workforce. <\/p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector that the Government strongly supports.

The increased subsidies and wider access to subsidies that will arise with the Affordable Childcare Scheme are likely to increase the demand for Tusla-registered childcare (including Tusla-registered childminders) through increasing parents' participation in the labour market and through incentivising parents to switch from unregistered childcare to registered childcare. The lack of Irish evidence on the price elasticity of demand for childcare makes it hard to estimate the likely scale of these effects.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the number of children who benefit from subsidies will depend on the response by childcare providers, as the subsidies will only be available to providers who choose to participate in the Scheme. A particular uncertainty here is the number of currently unregistered childminders who are eligible to register with Tusla and who may choose to do so for the first time in order to take part in the Scheme. While the number of registered childminders is small at the moment, work is commencing on the development of a childminding action plan, which is intended to increase the number of registered childminders over the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these various uncertainties, at this stage we do not have a single estimate of the likely number of beneficiaries or the cost of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Regulatory Impact Analysis published in December 2017 estimated that the full-year costs of the Scheme might amount to between &euro;165m and &euro;193m, though the full impact of the dynamic effects might only be seen over time rather than in the first year of the Scheme. The &euro;165m cost estimate, which was drawn from a model developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, assumed that approximately 82,000 children would benefit from childcare subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, of which approximately 59,000 were expected to benefit from a targeted subsidy and 23,000 from a universal subsidy. <\/p>  <p>  The estimates of the number of beneficiaries, including the likely number of beneficiaries in different income-brackets, continue to be re-examined on an on-going basis, as new data becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300089#WRX05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Remit","counter":1306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300090#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[28871\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300090#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on whether HIQA should have the power to enforce its recommendations in childcare services.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1308,"content":"<p>HIQA plays a vital role in ensuring that standards and regulatory requirements - across all domains of the wider health family, including social care services for children - are being met.

The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the Civil Registration Act 2004 which now provides for the registration of stillbirths, in section 28.<\/p>  <p>  When the 1994 Act was introduced it was primarily to afford comfort to the bereaved parents.  For this reason it was felt that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms.  During the passage of the 1994 Act detailed consideration was given, by the Oireachtas, as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be.  It was decided to use the broadest definition available to allow as many registrations as possible.  The definition that was agreed on is based on the international medical meaning of the term 'stillborn child'.<\/p>  <p>  The definition is now contained in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act and provides that a stillborn child \"means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life\".<\/p>  <p>  Stillbirths which occurred in Ireland prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act may be registered, if the criteria set out in this definition are fulfilled.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of 'stillborn' varies from country to country.  Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both.  In Ireland, in order to broaden the definition, either criterion can be used.  For international comparison purposes the World Health Organization recommends that a stillbirth be defined as a baby born with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks' gestation.<\/p>  <p>  While acknowledging that the loss for the family concerned there are no plans to amend the legislation as the definition of a stillbirth contained in the 2004 Act is consistent with accepted medical norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300091#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Review","counter":1373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300091#WRZ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1374,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[28638\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300091#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the length of a survey required to be carried out when requesting a review of the payment for the free transport scheme; if it is six months, the same as the initial survey or if it is two weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1375,"content":"<p>The free travel scheme permits free travel on most CI&Eacute; public transport services, Luas and a range of services offered by some 80 private operators in various parts of the country for those eligible under the scheme.

In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.  <\/p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.

People on widow&rsquo;s non-contributory pension are automatically transferred to the State pension non-contributory once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (i.e.  at State pension age) to ensure alignment with the secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension, and may qualify for the living alone increase and the TSA at that time.   <\/p>  <p>  The schemes that allow a person aged under 66 to receive the living alone increase or the TSA are Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension.  Because of the qualifying criteria for these schemes recipients would be considered more vulnerable to social isolation.  This is not generally the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s non-contributory payment who are aged less than 66, and who will not, as a rule, have an incapacity of that nature.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend both the living alone increase and the TSA to include people on the widow&rsquo;s non-contributory payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300092#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Payments","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300092#WRAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[29244\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300092#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when payment will issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who has such a disability that they require that level of care.<\/p><p>As a result of an appeals officer&rsquo;s decision, CA was awarded to the person concerned on 29 June 2018.

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p><p>The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to the tenant&rsquo;s reckonable annual income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the local authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved, as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Reckonable Annual Income<\/th><th>Discount<\/th><th>Charge period<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000<\/td><td>60%<\/td><td>30 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between  &euro;20,001 and &euro;29,999<\/td><td>50%<\/td><td>25 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 or more<\/td><td>40%<\/td><td>20 years<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his\/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.<\/p><p>In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.

In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.

From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land, and that analysis is progressing well.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.

The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.   <\/p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am redirecting the &euro;50 million funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.

At the end of 2017, there were 13,400 social housing homes in the construction programme, up substantially on the 8,500 homes in the programme just a year earlier, and this continues to grow on a weekly basis. <\/p><p>In addition, Dublin local authorities are bringing forward major sites for mixed-tenure development such as the 900 homes at Kilcarbery in Clondalkin, where procurement will be finalised in the Autumn, and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, a 600-home site in the City Council area where the procurement process is moving into competitive dialogue stage and should be finalised in early 2019.  Proposals for other key sites across Dublin are also being developed. <\/p><p>I have commenced the statutory provisions for the new affordable purchase scheme.

It is included in the Record of Monuments and Places under the National Monuments Acts and is entitled to the statutory protections of those Acts. <\/p>  <p>  I fully appreciate the extent of the local interest in the friary and the understandable desire to see the substantial works to safeguard it carried out as soon as possible. As far as the State's ability to assist is concerned though, the position is that there are already approximately 1,000 national monuments in its care which demand very extensive resource allocations, both in terms of funding and personnel. <\/p>  <p>  The care, maintenance and presentation of each of these national monuments is undertaken by the Office of Public Works in consultation and with the advice of my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service in every case. Against the background of the resources needed to service the extensive portfolio of monuments already in State care I regret that it is not possible at present to consider adding the local authority owned Court Abbey to that list. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does, however, operate a number of schemes that provide financial support for the conservation and protection of historic buildings. These schemes are administered by local authorities and include the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. Details are available on the Department's and on  local authority websites.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for the 2018 funding, under which 12 projects in Co. Sligo are being assisted, has now passed.  My Department remains in contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best possible use of allocations, including by redistributing  monies when, for example, projects do not go ahead. I would encourage the local authority in this case to consider pursuing this alternative avenue of funding for Court Abbey.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Structures at Risk Scheme will be revamped and become the  Historic Structures Fund and it is open to Sligo County Council to apply for support under that fund when it is rolled out later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Museum Projects","counter":1595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1596,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[29278\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her attention has been drawn to plans to create a museum of policing in the former Garda station in Kevin Street in view of its historical role in policing history (details supplied); if she has discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1597,"content":"<p>My Department has received no formal approach with respect to a museum of policing at the former Kevin Street Garda Station site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Service Level Agreements","counter":1598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05550"},{"type":"question","counter":1599,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[29305\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300094#WRCC05600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 614 of 19 June 2018, if a date of completion has been decided upon by the SLA.
