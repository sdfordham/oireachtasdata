We had asked about top-up payments to principals and senior management in fee-paying schools.  In a letter dated 8 May, the Secretary General said that he wrote to the committee in respect of compliance on public sector pay policy.  He went on to say that in this context the Department did not seek further information about payments in individual schools other than those made by the Department to 60,000 of its staff.  He added that the Department was aware that fee-paying schools have access to additional funding which may be used to pay additional remuneration to staff, including principals and senior management, in return for additional work.  This is like the section 38 and section 39 organisations in that basic pay is being paid by the public purse, the taxpayer, directly to the school principals while some organisations, like those we have been dealing with in the health area as a result of the internal audit, have access to private funds which they have been using for top-up payments.<\/p> <p>Here we are inquiring about that issue in this context.  It is a direct parallel.  The Secretary General says the Department is aware that fee-paying schools have access to additional funding and says no more about it.  The purpose of our enquiry was to see if they are getting top-up salaries.  Are top-up salaries being paid in the education sector where the institutions have access to private funds in addition to State funds paying basic salaries?  We need an answer to that question.  The Secretary General does not answer it or even suggest that he will answer it.  That is wholly unsatisfactory.  We should write back to him seeking the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014091800002#A01300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411031400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We will write back and include a copy of the Official Report of the meeting and ask for the information.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.1, correspondence, dated 17 July 2014, from the chief executive officer, Irish Sports Council relating to Horse Sport Ireland, is to be noted and published.

It is good to finally get this correspondence from Professor Brennan on this issue.  I had hoped she would come before the committee at this time of year.  She had been unable to come before it until now and over the summer it appears she decided she did not need or want to come before it, and wrote a detailed letter.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise a couple of points.  In the letter she mentioned that we have been unable to get certain key people from executives or boards to come before the committee.  Do we have a list of people we have asked to come before this committee in regard to the docklands and the Irish Glass Bottle site who have said \"No\" to us and if they have given reasons for that?  <\/p><p>  Professor Brennan also states that because the people concerned could not come before the committee promptly, facts have not been ascertained and that there has been a conflict of evidence in the evidence we have received.  That is true but her take on the comments of the individuals who came before us and conflicts they gave in their evidence and where the conflicts were would help us better determine which statements were true and which were not.  There is a cloud over some of the evidence given to us from subsequent correspondence which has come to this committee.<\/p><p>  She also states that factually incorrect evidence was to given us.  If that is the case that is very important and we need to hear what that evidence was and how it is factually incorrect.  Serious claims were made against Professor Brennan in this committee about the preparation of reports into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, how they might have been influenced and how certain people were not given leave to examine those draft reports before they were finally published.  We need to hear a proper response to that.  <\/p><p>  Professor Brennan said that no useful purpose would be served by her becoming involved in a highly personalised confrontation.  She is correct.  We do not want the committee to be a scene where people can take potshots at each other.  She could appear before us and address those conflicts in the evidence we heard, those issues that were factually incorrect and the charges levelled against her and her stewardship when she came in to rescue the authority.  In addition, it would be interesting to get her insight into the culture of the organisation because that was a key factor around what happened in there and to probe her on some of the aspects of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other evidence we have heard.

It also relates to the licensing and permit system which has shifted dramatically in recent years and the manner in which local authorities deal with it.  I  refer to the manner in which the private sector is involved in a very free-for-all marketing.  There is no tendering process and all the players engage in the market.

I received a communication from the clerk to the effect that another committee of the D&aacute;il is examining the procurement issue in a broader sense.  I would like to argue in favour of this committee proceeding with its hearing on public procurement, if only because we have already begun to probe these issues and have given an undertaking to particular bodies that they would be able to come before us to make presentations.  The argument being made - in respect of which we must establish the facts - is that some of the practices being employed represent a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  In other words, there is a value-for-money deficit in terms of how the State is proceeding in this area.<\/p><p>  There is another issue to which I wish to draw the attention of the committee, although I probably really do not need to do so because it is already in the public domain.  I refer to school building contracts relating to the Department of Education and Skills.  There have been reports of abuse of practices involving the employment of subcontractors and a resultant loss of revenue to the State in the context of PAYE and, presumably, PRSI payments.  These alleged practices also give rise to associated costs, etc., with regard to social welfare payments.  Some &euro;2 billion was allocated to the school building fund when it was established either last year or the year before.  Reports of malpractice in this area are giving rise to grave public concern.  I am of the view that the matter merits investigation.  I am seeking some guidance as to whether - if there is agreement among members - we might approach this matter by holding a hearing on it or whether there might be a need for an investigation to be carried out and a report issued by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the first instance to establish the scale of the problem.  This matter is a cause of extreme concern to taxpayers, construction workers and others.  I am of the view that we should give consideration to it and perhaps even prioritise it within our programme of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014091800008#G00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1411033500,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I support Deputy McDonald on this matter because I have the same concerns with regard to it.

I am also seeking guidance on this matter but I would certainly like the committee to examine it.  I am of the view that it would be extremely difficult to invite representatives from individual primary schools at which construction work is being carried out because the members of boards of management of such schools are largely volunteers.  If I understand the position correctly, even though they would not be obliged to submit to our request, perhaps we might ask representatives from certain education and training boards to come before us.  These boards would be the lead organisations in respect of some of the construction work and they might be in a position to throw some light on the issue.  Like Deputy McDonald, I have heard a number of serious allegations on this matter and I would welcome it if the committee could investigate the position not only in the context of obtaining justice for the workers involved, but also because State money is being used.

It involves the Department of Social Protection and Revenue.  The Department in recent times has moved from having no involvement in it to having some giant inspections where officials have visited sites and checked workers' personal public service numbers.  In a few cases they were probably able to find the employer in due course which could have been two years after the project was completed but it would have been of no value to the workers in the meantime.<\/p><p>  When contacting Department of Education and Skills, another issue is - I referred to some projects in the past - that the Exchequer money is effectively going to the main contractor who then passes it on to a subcontractor.  I have cited instances of subcontractors bussing people to a social welfare office on a Thursday morning to sign on and then bussing them back to the site where they change into their working clothes and carry on the day's work.  That has been happening across the board.<\/p><p>  When contacting the Department of Education and Skills, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, comes into this as well.  The Department's response has been that it is the responsibility of the architect, who normally certifies the stage payments, to certify that the work was properly expended.  I have spoken to architects who feel they have no real competence in these types of issues but they were the only link in the chain to certify that the work was being done and that payment should be made.  It might be worth getting a comment from them perhaps after we get a report.<\/p><p>  We should also include the issue of the public-private partnerships, PPPs.  If there are any PPP bundles currently in gestation or in operation, we should make sure they are included as well.  I have seen much malpractice in PPPs and I have even referred to it in the context of current PPPs being conducted by the NRA.  Some of the workers on some of the jobs being done in the Dublin region have told me that they would only be employed by a subcontractor on the basis that they were signing on, and we all know where that is leading.  The PPP element comes into it as well as the direct contract from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014091800009#H00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1411033800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I do not want to prolong discussion but there is a view emerging on the committee that we should raise this.

It seems the whole thing is hugely exploitative and it involves a number of State agencies.  Certainly for my party the objective of this exercise would not be to put boards of management of schools in a pressurised position.  That is not the issue.  Even outside the construction of school buildings, there is a more generalised issue around the capital programme and practices in terms of sourcing, seeking and achieving Government contracts.

I wish to ask about education.  Deputy McDonald is correct that the Department of Education and Science spent approximately &euro;2 billion and there are a large number of contracts in that respect, but there are obviously other Departments as well where there are similar tenders and procurement.  The PPP sector had its heyday in the past and there were many PPPs in operation, some of which fell by the wayside because they seemed to be controlled largely by the private sector rather than by the State sector in terms of management and timelines.  All of those areas probably require a degree of regulation and supervision that has not been in place previously.  Rumours and allegations are widespread in terms of the manner in which the construction sector conducts it business.  Where public money is spent, it is important to have a tight rein to ensure the systems in place are properly monitored and examined.  I would like to see a number of Departments, not just the Department of Education and Science, that are engaged with large scale public funds examined and that they would provide a report.  Broader reports are required on tendering, procurement and overall supervision during projects.  The reports could come from the Departments themselves in the first instance and then we could have an examination of the nuts and bolts with the relevant bodies that operate the tenders and funding for the work being carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014091800010#J00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1411034100,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We have agreed the work programme and we are adding to it the discussion we just had on the scope of work the clerk, Mr. Ted McEnery, will do.

I am sure we have all been approached by different developers who felt they had been treated unfairly by NAMA and we should take those concerns with a pinch of salt, given the work NAMA had to do.  We spent a lot of time on NAMA in this committee and any time serious charges have been levelled against NAMA, it has responded very well.  We have gone into different areas in detail and it has been able to back up the different things it has done.  We looked at the Comptroller and Auditor General's triennial report earlier in the year but since then, and going back to Deputy Deasy's point, we had the Department of Finance's review also which we have not had a chance to examine.  If we are bringing NAMA before the committee we should bring in the Department of Finance also to go through that report and then talk about the future.
