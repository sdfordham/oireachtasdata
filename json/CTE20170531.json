We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  We will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts, Vote 20, for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dealing specifically with the interim internal audit report on financial procedures in the Garda College.  We met on this matter on 4 May 2017 and the issues discussed are of such concern that the committee has decided that further engagement is required.  We will be keeping today's meeting to the matter of the interim audit report, and expect to meet with the Commissioner and others in respect of the same topic on 14 June.  We will deal with the rest of the Vote on 13 July, when the Commissioner will be before the committee again.  While the report refers to matters that have their history in events that span at least a couple of decades, the primary focus of today's meeting will be on what happened since 2015.  I ask members and witnesses to co-operate in maintaining this focus.<\/p><p>We are joined today by the following witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit and author of the interim audit report; Mr. John Barrett, executive director, human resources and people development; Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director, finance and services; Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal services; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Mr. Michael Howard, former head of the Garda audit committee.  From the Department of Justice and Equality, we are joined by Ms Anne Barry, principal officer, policing division; and Mr. Paul McDonnell from the policing division.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be turned off completely or put into flight mode as they interfere with the recording equipment.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> Before I call Mr. Niall Kelly to make his opening statement, I wish to point out that we have asked for only one statement from the head of internal audit and other people will also be questioned.  I apologise but there is a change to the schedule for today.  We had originally scheduled the meeting to commence this morning and to resume at 5 p.m. following a break in the afternoon.  Due to commitments in the House, we have had to reschedule that.  We will meet from now and my plan is that in two hours, we will take a short break for ten minutes, and continue until approximately 2 p.m.  We will then break until 5 p.m., when we will return for an evening session, as originally intended.  We may have indicated we were bringing that forward but, due to other commitments in the House, we are proceeding with the original plan.  I hope people will appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#F00600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>On a procedural note, we have just got notice that there may be votes in the D&aacute;il on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016, the deliberations on which started at 10 a.m.  By virtue of those of us here being from different parties, are we all paired so it will not disrupt this morning's session?

I do not intend going into the detail of the report, which speaks for itself, but rather to advance some of the discussion points from our previous meeting.  The report contains 19 recommendations, which were fully accepted by the Garda executive committee when I presented it with a draft of the report on 6 September 2016.  The findings and recommendations in the report are robust and stand up to scrutiny.  I would like to add that the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, has recently undergone an external review by a firm of accountants which concluded that the section is fully in compliance with the international professional practice framework of the Global Institute of Internal Auditors.  This is the internationally recognised best practice standard for internal audit.<\/p> <p>  I started work in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as head of internal audit ten years ago in June 2007.  At that time and for the next two years approximately, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald, who is mentioned in the report in the context of the Garda Boat Club issue.  From 2009 until his retirement in 2014, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Rice.  It was Deputy Commissioner Rice who stated in a note to the Commissioner on 18 September 2009, &ldquo;I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from whom they were collected and I equally hold that any money cannot be used except for the welfare and development of the facilities for members at [An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na]&rdquo;.  Deputy Commissioner Rice did not seek my advice in regarding this issue prior to sending his note to the Commissioner in 2009.  Had he done so, I would have pointed out that this was contrary to section C5.19 of the Public Financial Procedures &ndash; the blue book - which, under the heading \"Exchequer Extra Receipts\", states, \"These are receipts that the Department of Finance directs must be credited directly to the Exchequer and cannot be retained by Departments for their own use\".  The position of deputy commissioner was occupied by Kieran Kenny from mid-2014 to the end of 2015, when D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took over.<\/p> <p>  In regard to interference, non-co-operation and withholding information from internal audit, there are three periods of time that should be considered: first, the period from 2008 to 2011; second, the period from July 2015 to March 2016; and third, the period from September 2016 to March 2017.  I will deal with the period 2008 to 2011.  In this period, it is apparent that some people did not want the newly-appointed and very independent internal auditor from looking too critically at the Garda College.  These people included my direct superiors during the period in question.  When I did make inquires and attempted to get information, this information was withheld from me, as apparent from the strings of emails between the chief administrative officer, the executive director of finance, the chief superintendent and the administrator at the Garda College on 15 April 2010.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with the period from July 2015 to March 2016.  On 27 July 2015, all managers from chief superintendent, head of section or principal officer grade upwards attended a briefing session in Templemore on the modernisation and renewal programme.  At a break in this session, Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal affairs, asked me how the discussion about the Garda College at the audit committee meeting of the previous week, on 15 July, had gone.  I told Mr. Ruane that no discussion took place at the audit committee meeting.  He informed me that there were serious issues in the Garda College that I should be aware of and that Mr. John Barrett had prepared a document for Mr. Cyril Dunne, the then chief administrative officer, to brief the audit committee.  Later that day, the meeting between the Commissioner, Mr. John Barrett, the two deputy commissioners and the executive director of finance took place - this was the meeting discussed at the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It should be noted that I was not invited to attend this meeting or informed of the outcome.  The following day, at a break in another meeting in Westmanstown, County Dublin, I raised the issue with Superintendent John Keegan of the office of the deputy commissioner for governance and strategy.  I spoke again with Superintendent Keegan at more length the following day - 29 July - at Garda headquarters.  I have a contemporaneous note of these conversations, written in my own hand on 4 August 2015.  I wrote, \"Superintendent Keegan was of the view that these issues were similar to concerns that were expressed several years previously and which had been audited by GIAS and the executive director of finance and had been resolved\".  The Garda College issues were raised at the audit committee meeting of 30 September 2015 by Mr. Cyril Dunne.  However, this discussion took place under the heading \"any other business\" at the end of a long agenda, with no documents circulated either before or at the meeting.<\/p><p>The chief administrative officer, CAO, had not sought to put the issue on the agenda of the meeting, even though he had a detailed report from Mr. Barrett since July of that year. <br\/><br\/>A working group was set up in the summer of 2015 to consider the issues in the college.  I was told by Cyril Dunne, CAO, John Keegan, superintendent, and Kieran Kenny, deputy commissioner, on numerous occasions that internal audit should not be involved in the working group.  This was because internal audit may be required to audit at a later stage.  I had no difficulty with this.  I was also informed that legal issues were being advanced with regard to the land and employee status at the college and until these legal issues were resolved, it would be unwise to commence an audit.  I now know that I was misled with regard to the legal issues as the head of legal affairs, Mr. Ruane, was advising from July 2015 onwards that internal audit should be requested to commence an audit immediately. <br\/><br\/>The former chief administrative officer, Mr. Dunne, indicated to the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, as part of the consultative process that he wanted to check the issues presented to him by Mr. Barrett and gather more information.  In response to this point, I state as following on page 15 of the report:<\/p><blockquote>While GIAS acknowledge the contribution of the former CAO in progressing the issues we conclude that GIAS should have been informed immediately and that the report of the Executive Director HR&amp;amp;PD should have been put on the Agenda of the Audit Committee meeting in July 2015.  GIAS with the backing of the Audit Committee were better placed to do the investigative and information gathering process that was taken on by the former CAO in July 2015.<\/blockquote><p>From September 2016 to March 2017, when a draft reports was concluded, I consulted widely with persons that could possibly be identified in the report to ensure that fair procedures were observed.  That was the reason for the gap at that time.  As a result of this process some changes were made to the body of the report but these did not affect the audit opinion and main findings and recommendations contained in the executive summary to the report. <br\/><br\/>Two of the responses were from the executive director of finance and services, Mr. Culhane, dated 13 October 2016 and 20 February 2017.  I understand he also wrote to the chair of the audit committee, Mr. Howard.  I find these two letters totally unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions my motives and my professional integrity and competence.  I can only view these letters as an attempt to undermine the report or to try to get me to change my audit opinion, findings and recommendations. <br\/><br\/>The audit report is entitled &quot;Interim Audit Report&quot;.  This is because it is envisaged that further audit work would be required.  The report gives a wide panoramic view of the financial controls in the Garda College from 2009 to 2016.  It should be noted that I plan a series of audits on aspects of the Garda College over the next two years or so.  I can assure this committee that I will persist in reviewing these issues until they are all satisfactorily resolved.  Since the last meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts, we have commenced two specific audits on EU-funded projects and programmes concerning the college going back to 1998 and on current controls of cash in the college restaurant, shop, vending machines and bar, as well as current banking arrangements.  I hope to have these two audit reports completed by the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 13 July. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I wish to make points on two issues at the heart of the findings from the report and its surrounding discussions, namely, governance and culture.  The report and issues around it identify failures of governance as exemplified by the correspondence between the then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and the then CAO, John Leamy, on 25 April and 8 May 2008, when six action points were agreed and instruction given to implement these points by the Commissioner, that is, the Accounting Officer.  I do not need to tell this committee but for the record it should be noted that in the public service, the role of Accounting Officer comprises all the responsibilities of the board of directors in the private sector.  That the instructions of the Accounting Officer were not followed but another investigative process initiated between Deputy Commissioner Rice and the chief superintendent in the Garda College is a failure of governance. <br\/><br\/>Having concluded this audit and gone through all the discussions and analysis of the issues over the last two years, I am convinced that there was and may still be in some parts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a culture of not admitting to problems and, when these problems persist, trying to keep them in-house and away from transparent public scrutiny.  This is apparent from the reluctance by senior management to get internal audit involved in the period from 2008 to 2011 and the period from July 2015 to March 2016. <br\/><br\/>There is also evident a culture that thinks An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is different from other public sector bodies and that the normal processes of financial procedures and transparent democratic accountability do not apply, as in Deputy Commissioner Rice&rsquo;s letter of 18 September 2009, for example.<br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for its time and its assistance to me as internal auditor of the Garda Vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Before calling the speakers, I note they have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies Connolly; MacSharry; Cullinane; Kelly; Catherine Murphy; McDonald and Madigan.

There will be further opportunities during the course of the day.<\/p> <p>  There was one point I wanted to take up directly before we proceed on the opening statement and it concerns Mr. Kelly and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Kelly says in his opening statement, referring to a letter of 20 February 2017, that he finds this letter unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions his motives, professional integrity and competence.  I would like to ask Mr. Culhane about that letter, I am sure that he is familiar with it.  We will get it up on the screen.  This is the letter dated 20 February 2017. There is such a volume of documentation here today that it is going to be difficult to get it up on the screen but I will read the particular passage.

In the fourth paragraph, at the end of the second page, Mr. Culhane writes to Mr. Kelly that at a meeting in the college he, Mr. Kelly, stated to Superintendent McCabe, the college administrator, that he, Mr. Kelly, believed that the college had offshore bank accounts.

There are a couple of general points that I would like to get across.  Before I say anything else, in case I do not get an opportunity to say this, the audit committee has formally commended Niall Kelly on his work in relation to this.  I think that I should say that.  In approaching this, I cannot ignore the fact there has been some controversy and debate.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Kelly was performing a task assigned to him by his employer.  There is no question that he ever had any motivation other than to do that task impartially and objectively.  Given the scale of the issue as it subsequently emerged, I devoted an enormous amount of time to this, way out of what one would normally devote as chair of an audit committee, to reviewing the work of the internal auditor.  Niall Kelly was always completely open with me.  I am satisfied and my committee is satisfied that the conclusions in his interim report are very firmly grounded on fact.  I think I should say that before I say anything else.<\/p> <p>  I would, if I may, briefly skip through the narrative as it emerged from the point of view of the audit committee.  In case anyone is a little unclear of the role of the audit committee, I am a retired civil servant.  There are five people on the audit committee, a deputy commissioner who sits there permanently and four outside members, one of whom has to be chair.  In addressing the members I want to say that the committee addressed this as an issue on which we had consensus.  There were no divided opinions.  I should start by saying that the matter was raised first with the audit committee on 30 September but it was raised verbally as an AOB item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Was that 30 September 2015?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Yes, 2015.  Again, I want to be very careful because I am going to stick entirely to the facts as they were revealed to me.  The normal business of audit is conducted in arrears, so in the routine, Niall Kelly would complete audit reports, they would be brought to the committee, they would be reviewed, we would approve them, we might question them and we would go on.  Our role is to advise the Commissioner on matters of finance, audit, risk, governance and so forth.  Obviously we address other things at meetings.  There was a very busy agenda that day and at the end of the meeting this was raised verbally as an AOB item.  There was no briefing given to us.  I have reflected on how I will phrase this: neither I nor any of the other outside members of the committee took from that briefing any sense of the importance of this issue as it subsequently emerged.  Ultimately, this issue was so serious that the Accounting Officer had to amend the statement of internal financial control.  I do not believe that has happened before on the Garda Vote so, objectively speaking, this was a very serious issue.  It was raised, we discussed it a bit and we were asked if we would include it in the 2016 programme of work, which was done - that was Mr. Kelly's report in its time - but no indication was given to us that this was different.  I will again confine it  to what was my impression and I will put this in these terms: I worked in the Civil Service for 35 years.  I do not believe that I was a na&iuml;ve or uninformed listener to that briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will be stuck for time and there are serious questions to be asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L02000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>No, I thank him for outlining the background.

In my own work I have seen this, where one can have issues about the ownership of land, so it was important but I was not aware that it was serious.

Sometimes the early exchanges were bordering on hostility towards each other, with people needing to make freedom of information, FOI, requests to get information.  This is all from people who are supposed to be on the same side, which is the side of the people, in order to give proper evidence and ensure ultimately the correct expenditure of public money in order that people can be satisfied their hard-earned money is spent appropriately and accounted for.  If we as committee members are surprised, one can imagine that people looking in are aghast at that last exchange and what has transpired here this morning.  This is from the civilian side of the force, not even the officers.  Mr. Barrett said he had spent a lifetime ensuring the proper expenditure of money in multinationals and that it would not happen there, but it is unreal that it happens repeatedly in the public sector, with these issues being illuminated.<\/p><p>At the heart of this is the misappropriation of funds in the force that is responsible for justice in this State.  As Mr. Culhane said, it was a culture that went back to the 1960s.  It is fair to say that the swinging sixties seem to have been kept going to the present day.  If Austin Powers had turned up in his time machine in Templemore, he would not have known that he was in a different decade given the testimony we have listened to.<\/p><p>Keeping to the report around which the Chairman has asked us to frame our remarks, recommendation No. 4 says that, &quot;Garda Staff assigned to administrative roles in the College had no training or experience in administration ... no knowledge of Public Financial Procedures (the Blue Book) [as Mr. Howard said, the roadmap] and associated governance codes [for] Public Procurement ... Risk Management&quot;, and then it goes on to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government Accounting Unit.  Being fair, does Mr. Kelly believe this is a simple case of the people who were <i>in situ<\/i>not being skilled and not having the necessary competence rather than a wilful misappropriation of funds or maybe even corruption?  Did they in fact believe that the surplus money was their money, as he pointed out at the beginning of his opening remarks, quoting Deputy Commissioner Rice at the time?  Is it the result of the arrangements that were in place, which Mr. Kelly touches on, and the effect of these arrangements going back to the 1980s?  In terms of capitation grants and at a time when things were going well and surpluses were being accumulated, as Mr. Kelly said, every time a scheme was dreamed up, there was another bank account and things were kept on an individual basis rather than a cumulative one.  Does he believe it is fair to paint everyone with the same brush, that there was wilful misappropriation, or was it the case that there was incompetence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>On balance, I believe it was more incompetence than wilful neglect or wilful whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is an important point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>However, as Mr. Barrett said earlier, ignorance of the law is not an excuse, and a lot of this stuff is set down in law, and very old law at that.

Mr. Kelly said in his opening remarks that the culture may still exist.  Given his strong beliefs, his statement that this culture might still exist, his background checks, can he tell me who is responsible for fuelling this culture?  Fuelling a culture has to come from a central point.  I do not want to hear about culture as an abstract idea, that is not the job of this committee.  If at the end of all these hearings, we have a nice tidy package, that it was just the culture going back to the 1960s.1980s, we will have achieved nothing.  Mr. Kelly will have done himself a disservice if this falls under \"culture\".  Who was fuelling that culture?  Who was keeping the information suppressed?

He is quoted here about holding the moneys within the college.

In that length of time cover ups, mismanagement and non-existent corporate governance were occurring in a college that we all had great faith in and through which we put our future garda&iacute;.  Here we are and it took until last year to come to the evidence we now hear around the litany of mismanagement.  With report after report, the Walsh report, the Fennelly report and the McGee report, it has taken until now to find out what is wrong.  It is totally unbelievable that this could be allowed to happen in a modern society and that the system was left in place for so long.  We could go through it all day but I will not review what everyone has already said.<\/p> <p> Let us go back to previous reports back in 2008 where the CEO noted that the director of finance be authorised to conduct a full and comprehensive audit of all financial activity in the college.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Internal Audit Service, GIAS, was not informed of the proposed audit at that time.  Recommendations put in place at the time included that 13 bank accounts be closed; a new college administrator role was to be established at superintendent rank; and new processes were to be put in place and reviewed at weekly performance accountability framework meetings.  Of the 12 specific recommendations from the director of finance's report, only two were implemented.  Of the six points agreed in correspondence between the commissioner and the chief administrative officer, none was implemented.  Why was this? Why did they not happen, after all the reports down the years?<\/p> <p>  In 2012 - and I have all the recommendations marked off here - compliance with public procurement requirements was implemented on the recommendations of the Garda inspectorate at the time and the development review group.

I think this is a very significant issue.  I think, around this, I have a very substantial difference of opinion with the finance director.  I think there is a very significant difference between outputs and outcomes.  There may be memos and there may be meeting details, as Mr. Culhane outlined, but it changed nothing.  The show went on.  On my arrival in Templemore, I just could not believe what it was that sat in plain view and, despite all the memos and all of the history Mr. Culhane has referred to, that it continued in plain view, contrary to the blue book.

This is not some kind of Orwellian, four legs good, two legs bad - those who wear uniforms, those who do not.  It is nothing to do with that.  This is a fundamental issue about accountability around the public purse.  We have an obligation to come before the committee and tell it the truth.

I have had contemporaneous discussions with Mr. Ruane throughout this and he has minuted those meetings.  If the committee members want to take all of those details, and I would encourage them, they will see the sequence of events in its minutiae.  However, the reality is I did not create this.  I stumbled upon it.  I did not get, \"Let us resolve it\", as the first response.  That is a reality.
