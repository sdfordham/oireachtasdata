We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  We will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts, Vote 20, for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dealing specifically with the interim internal audit report on financial procedures in the Garda College.  We met on this matter on 4 May 2017 and the issues discussed are of such concern that the committee has decided that further engagement is required.  We will be keeping today's meeting to the matter of the interim audit report, and expect to meet with the Commissioner and others in respect of the same topic on 14 June.  We will deal with the rest of the Vote on 13 July, when the Commissioner will be before the committee again.  While the report refers to matters that have their history in events that span at least a couple of decades, the primary focus of today's meeting will be on what happened since 2015.  I ask members and witnesses to co-operate in maintaining this focus.<\/p><p>We are joined today by the following witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit and author of the interim audit report; Mr. John Barrett, executive director, human resources and people development; Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director, finance and services; Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal services; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Mr. Michael Howard, former head of the Garda audit committee.  From the Department of Justice and Equality, we are joined by Ms Anne Barry, principal officer, policing division; and Mr. Paul McDonnell from the policing division.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be turned off completely or put into flight mode as they interfere with the recording equipment.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> Before I call Mr. Niall Kelly to make his opening statement, I wish to point out that we have asked for only one statement from the head of internal audit and other people will also be questioned.  I apologise but there is a change to the schedule for today.  We had originally scheduled the meeting to commence this morning and to resume at 5 p.m. following a break in the afternoon.  Due to commitments in the House, we have had to reschedule that.  We will meet from now and my plan is that in two hours, we will take a short break for ten minutes, and continue until approximately 2 p.m.  We will then break until 5 p.m., when we will return for an evening session, as originally intended.  We may have indicated we were bringing that forward but, due to other commitments in the House, we are proceeding with the original plan.  I hope people will appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#F00600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>On a procedural note, we have just got notice that there may be votes in the D&aacute;il on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016, the deliberations on which started at 10 a.m.  By virtue of those of us here being from different parties, are we all paired so it will not disrupt this morning's session?

I do not intend going into the detail of the report, which speaks for itself, but rather to advance some of the discussion points from our previous meeting.  The report contains 19 recommendations, which were fully accepted by the Garda executive committee when I presented it with a draft of the report on 6 September 2016.  The findings and recommendations in the report are robust and stand up to scrutiny.  I would like to add that the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, has recently undergone an external review by a firm of accountants which concluded that the section is fully in compliance with the international professional practice framework of the Global Institute of Internal Auditors.  This is the internationally recognised best practice standard for internal audit.<\/p> <p>  I started work in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as head of internal audit ten years ago in June 2007.  At that time and for the next two years approximately, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald, who is mentioned in the report in the context of the Garda Boat Club issue.  From 2009 until his retirement in 2014, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Rice.  It was Deputy Commissioner Rice who stated in a note to the Commissioner on 18 September 2009, &ldquo;I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from whom they were collected and I equally hold that any money cannot be used except for the welfare and development of the facilities for members at [An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na]&rdquo;.  Deputy Commissioner Rice did not seek my advice in regarding this issue prior to sending his note to the Commissioner in 2009.  Had he done so, I would have pointed out that this was contrary to section C5.19 of the Public Financial Procedures &ndash; the blue book - which, under the heading \"Exchequer Extra Receipts\", states, \"These are receipts that the Department of Finance directs must be credited directly to the Exchequer and cannot be retained by Departments for their own use\".  The position of deputy commissioner was occupied by Kieran Kenny from mid-2014 to the end of 2015, when D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took over.<\/p> <p>  In regard to interference, non-co-operation and withholding information from internal audit, there are three periods of time that should be considered: first, the period from 2008 to 2011; second, the period from July 2015 to March 2016; and third, the period from September 2016 to March 2017.  I will deal with the period 2008 to 2011.  In this period, it is apparent that some people did not want the newly-appointed and very independent internal auditor from looking too critically at the Garda College.  These people included my direct superiors during the period in question.  When I did make inquires and attempted to get information, this information was withheld from me, as apparent from the strings of emails between the chief administrative officer, the executive director of finance, the chief superintendent and the administrator at the Garda College on 15 April 2010.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with the period from July 2015 to March 2016.  On 27 July 2015, all managers from chief superintendent, head of section or principal officer grade upwards attended a briefing session in Templemore on the modernisation and renewal programme.  At a break in this session, Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal affairs, asked me how the discussion about the Garda College at the audit committee meeting of the previous week, on 15 July, had gone.  I told Mr. Ruane that no discussion took place at the audit committee meeting.  He informed me that there were serious issues in the Garda College that I should be aware of and that Mr. John Barrett had prepared a document for Mr. Cyril Dunne, the then chief administrative officer, to brief the audit committee.  Later that day, the meeting between the Commissioner, Mr. John Barrett, the two deputy commissioners and the executive director of finance took place - this was the meeting discussed at the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It should be noted that I was not invited to attend this meeting or informed of the outcome.  The following day, at a break in another meeting in Westmanstown, County Dublin, I raised the issue with Superintendent John Keegan of the office of the deputy commissioner for governance and strategy.  I spoke again with Superintendent Keegan at more length the following day - 29 July - at Garda headquarters.  I have a contemporaneous note of these conversations, written in my own hand on 4 August 2015.  I wrote, \"Superintendent Keegan was of the view that these issues were similar to concerns that were expressed several years previously and which had been audited by GIAS and the executive director of finance and had been resolved\".  The Garda College issues were raised at the audit committee meeting of 30 September 2015 by Mr. Cyril Dunne.  However, this discussion took place under the heading \"any other business\" at the end of a long agenda, with no documents circulated either before or at the meeting.<\/p><p>The chief administrative officer, CAO, had not sought to put the issue on the agenda of the meeting, even though he had a detailed report from Mr. Barrett since July of that year. <br\/><br\/>A working group was set up in the summer of 2015 to consider the issues in the college.  I was told by Cyril Dunne, CAO, John Keegan, superintendent, and Kieran Kenny, deputy commissioner, on numerous occasions that internal audit should not be involved in the working group.  This was because internal audit may be required to audit at a later stage.  I had no difficulty with this.  I was also informed that legal issues were being advanced with regard to the land and employee status at the college and until these legal issues were resolved, it would be unwise to commence an audit.  I now know that I was misled with regard to the legal issues as the head of legal affairs, Mr. Ruane, was advising from July 2015 onwards that internal audit should be requested to commence an audit immediately. <br\/><br\/>The former chief administrative officer, Mr. Dunne, indicated to the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, as part of the consultative process that he wanted to check the issues presented to him by Mr. Barrett and gather more information.  In response to this point, I state as following on page 15 of the report:<\/p><blockquote>While GIAS acknowledge the contribution of the former CAO in progressing the issues we conclude that GIAS should have been informed immediately and that the report of the Executive Director HR&amp;amp;PD should have been put on the Agenda of the Audit Committee meeting in July 2015.  GIAS with the backing of the Audit Committee were better placed to do the investigative and information gathering process that was taken on by the former CAO in July 2015.<\/blockquote><p>From September 2016 to March 2017, when a draft reports was concluded, I consulted widely with persons that could possibly be identified in the report to ensure that fair procedures were observed.  That was the reason for the gap at that time.  As a result of this process some changes were made to the body of the report but these did not affect the audit opinion and main findings and recommendations contained in the executive summary to the report. <br\/><br\/>Two of the responses were from the executive director of finance and services, Mr. Culhane, dated 13 October 2016 and 20 February 2017.  I understand he also wrote to the chair of the audit committee, Mr. Howard.  I find these two letters totally unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions my motives and my professional integrity and competence.  I can only view these letters as an attempt to undermine the report or to try to get me to change my audit opinion, findings and recommendations. <br\/><br\/>The audit report is entitled &quot;Interim Audit Report&quot;.  This is because it is envisaged that further audit work would be required.  The report gives a wide panoramic view of the financial controls in the Garda College from 2009 to 2016.  It should be noted that I plan a series of audits on aspects of the Garda College over the next two years or so.  I can assure this committee that I will persist in reviewing these issues until they are all satisfactorily resolved.  Since the last meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts, we have commenced two specific audits on EU-funded projects and programmes concerning the college going back to 1998 and on current controls of cash in the college restaurant, shop, vending machines and bar, as well as current banking arrangements.  I hope to have these two audit reports completed by the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 13 July. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I wish to make points on two issues at the heart of the findings from the report and its surrounding discussions, namely, governance and culture.  The report and issues around it identify failures of governance as exemplified by the correspondence between the then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and the then CAO, John Leamy, on 25 April and 8 May 2008, when six action points were agreed and instruction given to implement these points by the Commissioner, that is, the Accounting Officer.  I do not need to tell this committee but for the record it should be noted that in the public service, the role of Accounting Officer comprises all the responsibilities of the board of directors in the private sector.  That the instructions of the Accounting Officer were not followed but another investigative process initiated between Deputy Commissioner Rice and the chief superintendent in the Garda College is a failure of governance. <br\/><br\/>Having concluded this audit and gone through all the discussions and analysis of the issues over the last two years, I am convinced that there was and may still be in some parts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a culture of not admitting to problems and, when these problems persist, trying to keep them in-house and away from transparent public scrutiny.  This is apparent from the reluctance by senior management to get internal audit involved in the period from 2008 to 2011 and the period from July 2015 to March 2016. <br\/><br\/>There is also evident a culture that thinks An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is different from other public sector bodies and that the normal processes of financial procedures and transparent democratic accountability do not apply, as in Deputy Commissioner Rice&rsquo;s letter of 18 September 2009, for example.<br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for its time and its assistance to me as internal auditor of the Garda Vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Before calling the speakers, I note they have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies Connolly; MacSharry; Cullinane; Kelly; Catherine Murphy; McDonald and Madigan.

There will be further opportunities during the course of the day.<\/p> <p>  There was one point I wanted to take up directly before we proceed on the opening statement and it concerns Mr. Kelly and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Kelly says in his opening statement, referring to a letter of 20 February 2017, that he finds this letter unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions his motives, professional integrity and competence.  I would like to ask Mr. Culhane about that letter, I am sure that he is familiar with it.  We will get it up on the screen.  This is the letter dated 20 February 2017. There is such a volume of documentation here today that it is going to be difficult to get it up on the screen but I will read the particular passage.

In the fourth paragraph, at the end of the second page, Mr. Culhane writes to Mr. Kelly that at a meeting in the college he, Mr. Kelly, stated to Superintendent McCabe, the college administrator, that he, Mr. Kelly, believed that the college had offshore bank accounts.

There are a couple of general points that I would like to get across.  Before I say anything else, in case I do not get an opportunity to say this, the audit committee has formally commended Niall Kelly on his work in relation to this.  I think that I should say that.  In approaching this, I cannot ignore the fact there has been some controversy and debate.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Kelly was performing a task assigned to him by his employer.  There is no question that he ever had any motivation other than to do that task impartially and objectively.  Given the scale of the issue as it subsequently emerged, I devoted an enormous amount of time to this, way out of what one would normally devote as chair of an audit committee, to reviewing the work of the internal auditor.  Niall Kelly was always completely open with me.  I am satisfied and my committee is satisfied that the conclusions in his interim report are very firmly grounded on fact.  I think I should say that before I say anything else.<\/p> <p>  I would, if I may, briefly skip through the narrative as it emerged from the point of view of the audit committee.  In case anyone is a little unclear of the role of the audit committee, I am a retired civil servant.  There are five people on the audit committee, a deputy commissioner who sits there permanently and four outside members, one of whom has to be chair.  In addressing the members I want to say that the committee addressed this as an issue on which we had consensus.  There were no divided opinions.  I should start by saying that the matter was raised first with the audit committee on 30 September but it was raised verbally as an AOB item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Was that 30 September 2015?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Yes, 2015.  Again, I want to be very careful because I am going to stick entirely to the facts as they were revealed to me.  The normal business of audit is conducted in arrears, so in the routine, Niall Kelly would complete audit reports, they would be brought to the committee, they would be reviewed, we would approve them, we might question them and we would go on.  Our role is to advise the Commissioner on matters of finance, audit, risk, governance and so forth.  Obviously we address other things at meetings.  There was a very busy agenda that day and at the end of the meeting this was raised verbally as an AOB item.  There was no briefing given to us.  I have reflected on how I will phrase this: neither I nor any of the other outside members of the committee took from that briefing any sense of the importance of this issue as it subsequently emerged.  Ultimately, this issue was so serious that the Accounting Officer had to amend the statement of internal financial control.  I do not believe that has happened before on the Garda Vote so, objectively speaking, this was a very serious issue.  It was raised, we discussed it a bit and we were asked if we would include it in the 2016 programme of work, which was done - that was Mr. Kelly's report in its time - but no indication was given to us that this was different.  I will again confine it  to what was my impression and I will put this in these terms: I worked in the Civil Service for 35 years.  I do not believe that I was a na&iuml;ve or uninformed listener to that briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will be stuck for time and there are serious questions to be asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L02000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#L02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>No, I thank him for outlining the background.

In my own work I have seen this, where one can have issues about the ownership of land, so it was important but I was not aware that it was serious.

Sometimes the early exchanges were bordering on hostility towards each other, with people needing to make freedom of information, FOI, requests to get information.  This is all from people who are supposed to be on the same side, which is the side of the people, in order to give proper evidence and ensure ultimately the correct expenditure of public money in order that people can be satisfied their hard-earned money is spent appropriately and accounted for.  If we as committee members are surprised, one can imagine that people looking in are aghast at that last exchange and what has transpired here this morning.  This is from the civilian side of the force, not even the officers.  Mr. Barrett said he had spent a lifetime ensuring the proper expenditure of money in multinationals and that it would not happen there, but it is unreal that it happens repeatedly in the public sector, with these issues being illuminated.<\/p><p>At the heart of this is the misappropriation of funds in the force that is responsible for justice in this State.  As Mr. Culhane said, it was a culture that went back to the 1960s.  It is fair to say that the swinging sixties seem to have been kept going to the present day.  If Austin Powers had turned up in his time machine in Templemore, he would not have known that he was in a different decade given the testimony we have listened to.<\/p><p>Keeping to the report around which the Chairman has asked us to frame our remarks, recommendation No. 4 says that, &quot;Garda Staff assigned to administrative roles in the College had no training or experience in administration ... no knowledge of Public Financial Procedures (the Blue Book) [as Mr. Howard said, the roadmap] and associated governance codes [for] Public Procurement ... Risk Management&quot;, and then it goes on to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government Accounting Unit.  Being fair, does Mr. Kelly believe this is a simple case of the people who were <i>in situ<\/i>not being skilled and not having the necessary competence rather than a wilful misappropriation of funds or maybe even corruption?  Did they in fact believe that the surplus money was their money, as he pointed out at the beginning of his opening remarks, quoting Deputy Commissioner Rice at the time?  Is it the result of the arrangements that were in place, which Mr. Kelly touches on, and the effect of these arrangements going back to the 1980s?  In terms of capitation grants and at a time when things were going well and surpluses were being accumulated, as Mr. Kelly said, every time a scheme was dreamed up, there was another bank account and things were kept on an individual basis rather than a cumulative one.  Does he believe it is fair to paint everyone with the same brush, that there was wilful misappropriation, or was it the case that there was incompetence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>On balance, I believe it was more incompetence than wilful neglect or wilful whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is an important point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#Y01700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>However, as Mr. Barrett said earlier, ignorance of the law is not an excuse, and a lot of this stuff is set down in law, and very old law at that.

Mr. Kelly said in his opening remarks that the culture may still exist.  Given his strong beliefs, his statement that this culture might still exist, his background checks, can he tell me who is responsible for fuelling this culture?  Fuelling a culture has to come from a central point.  I do not want to hear about culture as an abstract idea, that is not the job of this committee.  If at the end of all these hearings, we have a nice tidy package, that it was just the culture going back to the 1960s.1980s, we will have achieved nothing.  Mr. Kelly will have done himself a disservice if this falls under \"culture\".  Who was fuelling that culture?  Who was keeping the information suppressed?

He is quoted here about holding the moneys within the college.

In that length of time cover ups, mismanagement and non-existent corporate governance were occurring in a college that we all had great faith in and through which we put our future garda&iacute;.  Here we are and it took until last year to come to the evidence we now hear around the litany of mismanagement.  With report after report, the Walsh report, the Fennelly report and the McGee report, it has taken until now to find out what is wrong.  It is totally unbelievable that this could be allowed to happen in a modern society and that the system was left in place for so long.  We could go through it all day but I will not review what everyone has already said.<\/p> <p> Let us go back to previous reports back in 2008 where the CEO noted that the director of finance be authorised to conduct a full and comprehensive audit of all financial activity in the college.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Internal Audit Service, GIAS, was not informed of the proposed audit at that time.  Recommendations put in place at the time included that 13 bank accounts be closed; a new college administrator role was to be established at superintendent rank; and new processes were to be put in place and reviewed at weekly performance accountability framework meetings.  Of the 12 specific recommendations from the director of finance's report, only two were implemented.  Of the six points agreed in correspondence between the commissioner and the chief administrative officer, none was implemented.  Why was this? Why did they not happen, after all the reports down the years?<\/p> <p>  In 2012 - and I have all the recommendations marked off here - compliance with public procurement requirements was implemented on the recommendations of the Garda inspectorate at the time and the development review group.

I think this is a very significant issue.  I think, around this, I have a very substantial difference of opinion with the finance director.  I think there is a very significant difference between outputs and outcomes.  There may be memos and there may be meeting details, as Mr. Culhane outlined, but it changed nothing.  The show went on.  On my arrival in Templemore, I just could not believe what it was that sat in plain view and, despite all the memos and all of the history Mr. Culhane has referred to, that it continued in plain view, contrary to the blue book.

This is not some kind of Orwellian, four legs good, two legs bad - those who wear uniforms, those who do not.  It is nothing to do with that.  This is a fundamental issue about accountability around the public purse.  We have an obligation to come before the committee and tell it the truth.

I have had contemporaneous discussions with Mr. Ruane throughout this and he has minuted those meetings.  If the committee members want to take all of those details, and I would encourage them, they will see the sequence of events in its minutiae.  However, the reality is I did not create this.  I stumbled upon it.  I did not get, \"Let us resolve it\", as the first response.  That is a reality.

of pages.  We have seen multiple contradictions between Garda management, among themselves and with the Commissioner.  We have seen evidence that two members of civilian senior management do not have full confidence in their colleagues.  We see issues across the board over financial procedures to the point where we do not even know if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tax compliant.  We are talking about the Garda College and Garda finances but it is symbolic of a whole range of issues in the Garda.  It is GUBU territory as far as I am concerned.  This is a crisis for our country.  The evidence that has been given here today means we have a crisis in our country with the Garda and the justice system.  There is no way, given the evidence we have heard over ten hours or so, that I, as a public representative, could have confidence in senior Garda management or how the Garda is run.  There is absolutely no way; it is impossible.<\/p> <p>  I will restate some evidence from earlier and then I will do a quick fire round.  I would appreciate if people could be quick because otherwise I will keep coming back in all night.  Mr. Barrett gave evidence earlier which I will repeat because it is critically important.  We have two issues here.  We have the process, which is the issue we are really dealing with, and then we have the issues on the finances.  We are not even getting to the latter because there are so many questions about processes going back decades.<\/p> <p>  As a result of my concerns about how the Garda is run in the State, I need to zone in on up-to-date processes.  I will sum up what Mr. Barrett said in his evidence and he may correct me if I am wrong.  The Commissioner appeared before the committee and said the first time she was made aware of this was 27 July.  We heard that from the Commissioner.  The evidence she gave as a witness is she acted promptly.  There had already been a committee set up to deal with the issues in Templemore on 2 July.  It met on 2 July and both Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane were at it.  I asked Mr. Culhane if he agreed with what Mr. Barrett said and he said he did.  This is very important.  We now have evidence, which is a complete contradiction of what the current Garda Commissioner said about when these issues were being investigated.  To be fair, the Commissioner will appear before us in the coming weeks.  She says it was 27 July and that she acted promptly.  Two witnesses here have confirmed the committee had already been set up on 2 July.  The committee met after that.  I will ask questions about that.  <\/p> <p>  The second issue was raised by Mr. Ruane.  He has notes, as the legal representative, which state he was informed by Mr. Barrett that Mr. Cyril Dunne, the head of administration, had informed the Garda Commissioner about the issues in Templemore.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#MM04100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496217600,"counter":1288,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017053100002#MM04200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Ruane"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>He said he took a note of that.

To be honest, at the very beginning of this entire process I had every faith that Mr. Dunne was of like mind about where this thing was going, so it was not in any way creating a scenario of four legs good, two legs bad, and I am right and you are wrong.<\/p><p>I was saying to Mr. Cyril Dunne that there were some serious guidelines laid down by the Fennelly report that we needed to apply to this particular issue arising in the college.  It all surrounded the issue of effective communication.  We heard Mr. Howard talk earlier about the September meeting when there was an item under any other business, AOB, that made reference to the college.  Despite the fact that my report had been sitting there since 6 July, it was an AOB oral delivery and it clearly did not catch the imagination of the chairman.  That was his testimony earlier.  From 27 July - when Mr. Dunne had said it in that meeting in the college with the Commissioner, the acting deputies and himself - I became conscious that the material I had prepared for 6 July had not been given to the audit committee.  My antennae were tweaking a little bit as to why that had not happened.  By September, when I had this meeting with Mr. Dunne, I called him out and said that the Fennelly report should be read.  The report talks of the need for effective communication and how the section 41 issue should be interpreted.  I was conscious of the fact that on 24 July, Mr. Ken Ruane had written a letter saying that it was a section 41 matter and this was the advice over which privilege was being claimed.  I know that because I sat in on the meeting of 27 July where these issues were discussed.<br\/><br\/>By September I was beginning to feel concern that we were not making the kind of progress that we should.  That is the basis of the lengthy note, which I believe speaks for itself - <i>res ipsa loquitur.<\/i>It is very clear in terms of my concerns to Mr. Dunne.  I went to him, as my boss, and said that there are some issues that need to be addressed.  That is the genesis and the theme of the whole thing.  I draw members' attention to my note to Mr. Cyril Dunne, specifically to the chapter heading Interim Report of Justice Fennelly:<\/p><blockquote>Having carefully read and re read the Interim Report of the Fennelly Commission, I am very much clearer on the approach required in dealing with serious issues which may fall within the terms of section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I am satisfied that the matters which first came to my attention in June from Mr. McGee&rsquo;s report and subsequently, need to be very carefully and forensically investigated and do, on a prudential basis fall within the terms of [section] 41(1)(b) and (c) in particular and as advised by HOLA [head of legal affairs].

At this point in time, I genuinely believed that the light had been shone on this and we had to go forward and deal with it transparently, which can be seen from the notes I have circulated.  When this began, my thoughts were that there was only one way to deal with it.  We would deal with it openly, transparently and with the stakeholders.

I sought, therefore, to dig deeper.  As I did so, a number of matters came to my attention about people who were not, as it were, in the Garda Vote and those who were serving in the restaurant or doing other activities who I understood up to that point were civil servants and employed in the Garda College.  Immediately I began to get sight of what was, essentially, a private enterprise operating within the Garda College.  I raised my concerns about this.  Barry McGee very kindly, and I did not understand it was Michael at the back of this, gave me a copy of a report, because I asked him to assist me.  It was a copy of a report he did in 2008.  When I got that, I read it.  It is about 18 pages and I scanned through it very quickly.  I rang Cyril and said, \"Cyril, just got this.  I have asked Barry to make a copy for you.\"  Cyril had not seen it up to that point in time.<\/p><p>That is what he assured me, but the Deputy herself can ask him the question.  He and I began a dialogue about what to do about this.  Then we discovered there was a 2010 report done by Assistant Commission Jack Nolan, and Jack was very forthcoming and very helpful to me in my inquiries around this.  The lineage of the issue became clear to me.<\/p><p> I met with Mr. Culhane and Mr. McGee in my office at 14.15 on 30 June - this is in the report, at page 38 - and we discussed this quite openly.  My minute of the meeting is contemporaneous - it is right there.  The meeting began with my summary of the concerns on the general financial controls in the college, the need to appoint a qualified accountant and for that accountant to report, solid-line, to the CFO and, dotted line, to me as executive director.  This was seen as a good idea by the CFO, though it immediately pointed to a limited number of senior personnel to draw upon.  In response also, the CFO outlined the independence which the college had historically exercised.  This was all news to me.  I could not, quite frankly, get my head around the idea that we had these independent operations within the Garda college.<\/p><p> The meeting examined the need to seek a link between activity and cost in a meaningful system of accounting, like ABC, activity based costing, which would seek to hold resource managers to account for their stewardship of staff and all other types of resources.  I expressed the view that finance and HR should collaborate around that initiative so that we could better link deployment of operational choices to some kind of standard efficient measures.<\/p><p> My approach to this was entirely open-handed.

In the audit report, Mr. Kelly pointed out that the last set of accounts was 2009 and he mentioned that the independent accountant had audited them.  On page 25 of the interim report, it states that Mr. Kelly had discussions with the accountant regarding what qualification means and whether the accountant had any suspicion regarding possible misappropriation of money.  Mr. Kelly also noted that the control and record keeping was inadequate in terms of stock control and poor management.  He met with the accountant regarding further investigation he had done on the preliminary work on these accounts and he was reluctant to give an audit opinion from 2010 onward.<\/p> <p>  From 1 January 2014, Mr. Kelly was talking to the restaurant manager.  A small sample of transactions was audited in that case, including wage slips for work in the bar, a lodgement, a number of payments to suppliers, lodgements that were verified by lodgement slips, till receipts, etc.  Controls were noted to be weak.  Moving on to the restaurant, on page 26 of the report, he noted that restaurant expenses such as food, wages, and Revenue and pension contributions were paid from the restaurant account and all energy costs were paid through the Garda Vote.  Further down on page 26, he stated that the audit took sample payments from 2009 and 2015.  For supporting invoices and documentation in regard to each payment sampled, he was provided with all invoices and also provided with satisfactory explanations for payments to the account.

In fairness, on 4 May Mr. Nugent said he needed to get his ducks in a row as regards the issues.  I agree with him on that because they are probably <i>ad hoc<\/i>at the moment.  For God's sake, though, could he put in some interim procedures to allow the people of Templemore access to facilities, particularly when the garda&iacute; are not using them?  That is the right thing to do.  The Garda College contributes hugely to the local economy.  The local people embrace the college, welcome it and work with it, and do everything in that spirit.

I will make a few statements and if anyone disagrees with them, they should say so.  This is the easiest way of dealing with it.  It seems to me that the OPW did not actually know what it owned in Templemore, in Clonmore actually.  The Garda College was renting it out.  The OPW did not know it was not getting rent.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on this.  It is incredible.  It did not know it was not getting rent on something it owned.  The Garda College was renting it out and getting money.  I cannot understand how, in the whole budgeting and Estimates process, somewhere down the line, there was not a note to say there would be a deduction of &euro;38,000 or whatever the figure was because they were actually collecting the rent, so there could be some counterbalancing somewhere.

However in his position, as far as I am concerned, he needed to go further when action was not being taken, especially in 2008 and 2010, whether by notifying Mr. McCarthy or his predecessor, or going through internal audit.  On the basis of today's discussion, that raises very serious questions.<\/p> <p>  The last issue is also for Mr. Culhane.  We have heard here that in respect of four of the tax numbers, we do not know if the lads will be able to make sure that they are meeting requirements and tax compliant.

My name is Catherine Bond and I am the chief executive officer of the Irish Foster Care Association.  I have over 30 years of professional experience working in the area of children and families.  I am accompanied by Ms Breda O'Donovan, director of finance, HR and communications, IFCA.  Ms O'Donovan has worked with IFCA for over 15 years and was a foster carer for many years.<\/p><p>I do not propose to read through all of the information on the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, and fostering in Ireland as this information has been provided in our full opening statement.  In the interests of saving time, I will give a brief overview of what we do and then I will move quickly on to the issues and challenges in foster care today.<\/p><p> The IFCA is the representative body for foster care in Ireland and promotes excellence in foster care.  It has 1,600 members comprised of foster families, social workers, social care workers, academics and those with an interest in foster care.  The IFCA advocates for excellence in foster care and services to members include advocacy, a national support helpline, learning and development and support to members involved in local branches and regions.  <\/p><p> Foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State in Ireland.  We need to celebrate the fact that the majority of these children are growing up as happy, confident young people who attend school every day.  Indeed, some will be focusing on the upcoming State exams in the coming weeks.  Children in foster care are thriving and foster families are offering secure, happy and fulfilling childhoods to children, supporting them to reach their full potential in life.<\/p><p> Our national support helpline, which offers callers information and support, is the pulse in terms of issues which impact on foster carers as well as social workers and others involved in foster care.  The national standards for foster care set out a range of standards to be attained for the child, the foster carer and Tusla.  Specifically, there is a requirement for the child to have a dedicated social worker who is responsible for the safety and welfare of the child.  There is also a requirement for the foster carer to have a dedicated link social worker who provides support to the foster carer.  In March 2017 approximately 6 % of children in general foster care and 8% of children in relative care did not have a dedicated social worker.  This equates to over 400 children.  At the end of 2016, 18% of general foster carers and 20% of relative foster carers did not have a link social worker.  It is critical that this situation is addressed.<\/p><p> Foster care is complex and involves many stakeholders.  The IFCA&rsquo;s national support helpline statistics frequently cite poor communication as an underlying factor in the relationships involved.  Foster carers often express a lack of respect for the role which they offer.  It is critical for proactive, respectful and trusting relationships to be fostered, promoted and maintained.  The majority of children in the care of the State, many of whom have experienced traumatic early life events, reside with foster carers who offer stability and consistency to them.  It is also critical to have a robust infrastructure which supports foster care.  The IFCA advocates for the development of policies and procedures which underpin the work of Tusla and to provide a consistent approach to all aspects of foster care.  The IFCA is aware that Tusla has commenced a review and redevelopment of policies to inform practice in foster care and welcomes this.  It is critical that when policies are developed that they are disseminated throughout Tusla fostering teams, that staff are trained in the understanding and implementation of those policies and that regular monitoring and reviews of implementation are conducted.<\/p><p> The IFCA welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, of the introduction of the provision of after care plans for every child preparing for adulthood while in care.  The IFCA made a comprehensive submission to Tusla on the development of the after care policy and welcomes its implementation.  Many children who grow up in foster care continue to live with their foster care family.  Foster carers will require additional supports, for example, a carer's allowance where the young person remains living with them and who may not attain complete independence in adult life as a result of complex emotional or social needs.  One way to prevent homelessness among this group of vulnerable adults is to offer a financial incentive to foster carers to modify or build living accommodation where a young adult can live independently, but with the safety net of the wider foster family surrounding him or her, as is normal in many households across Ireland.  <\/p><p> During 2016, a predominant theme coming through on our national helpline was the handling by Tusla of allegations of abuse made against foster carers.  There were inconsistencies in the way such allegations were handled and the time it took to complete investigations was far too long.  Research indicates that allegations can be made against any foster carer.  This is a distressing event for everyone involved - the child, the foster carer, the foster carer&rsquo;s own children and the birth family.  It is therefore essential that the process is open and fair and underpinned by the rules of natural justice.  For many years the IFCA has advocated for one national policy in responding to allegations made against foster carers and welcomes the publication of the policy in May 2017.  It is vital that this new policy is implemented consistently across all Tusla areas, that social workers are trained in its implementation and that there is continuous assessment of its implementation.  <\/p><p> Research indicates that prior to the making of an allegation of abuse against a foster carer by a child, the foster carer noted increased behavioural problems and many requested respite support prior to the allegation being made.  Similar circumstances occur prior to placement breakdowns.  Responses to such requests are not always provided but it is critical that foster carers receive timely supports by social workers and other professionals when they seek such support.  They know the child, are aware when behaviour changes and when a timely intervention, such as a time away during the day or a short respite will alleviate the tension within the placement.  Foster carers must have access to ongoing support, information and training and the IFCA plays a central role in this within the confines of its budget.<\/p><p> The recent development of placing children with foster carers long distances from their place of birth has introduced a new paradigm into foster care.  The placement of children great distances from their home of origin requires foster carers to travel long distances to support access arrangements.  The shortage of social workers has also resulted in foster carers being requested to supervise access arrangements which is not part of the foster carer&rsquo;s role.  The IFCA has highlighted the inappropriateness of such requests with Tusla.<\/p><p> The IFCA welcomes this opportunity to share its knowledge and experience of foster care in Ireland with the committee.  We believe that focus on the following areas will assist in supporting all of those involved in foster care in Ireland: policies and procedures which are developed, fully implemented and monitored; timely supports to foster carers to enable them to care for children with very complex problems, on behalf of the State; and the allocation of dedicated social workers for all children in care and the allocation of link social workers to foster carers.  We would also suggest that the IFCA's national support service be enhanced to offer longer opening hours and a wider range of supports to foster carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2573,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bond for her contribution.

My name is Karla Charles and I am the policy manager in EPIC.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fidelma Guinan, who is an advocacy officer.<\/p> <p>  EPIC is an independent organisation established to advocate with, and on behalf of, children and young people in care and with care experience.  A core part of the work of EPIC is the provision of an individual advocacy and support service for children and young people with care experience.  EPIC welcomes the opportunity to discuss issues of foster care with the committee today.  EPIC would like to draw member's attention to a number of issues that we feel merit further attention.  These issues have been brought to our attention through our direct advocacy work with children and young people in care.  <\/p> <p>  The first issue is the cost of private versus Tusla-registered fostering.  There are a number of private foster care organisations operating in Ireland.  Placing a child through one of the private foster care organisations costs the State an average of &euro;58,000 per child per year versus &euro;17,900 for children fostered with foster carers registered directly with Tusla.  EPIC would encourage the committee to look into the disparity of cost between private providers and State agencies.  We would like to see greater analysis of costs versus service provision for children.  Currently, it seems to be more attractive for foster carers to register with private providers because they offer services like 24 hour phone support, which is particularly helpful for new carers and link foster care workers seem to have smaller caseloads.  Therefore, they are able to provide a higher level of support to foster carers.<\/p><p>I would like the committee to bear this in mind.<br\/><br\/>Placement breakdowns are sometimes inevitable but in order to learn from such breakdowns there needs to be greater oversight on the number of placement breakdowns, the reasons for the breakdowns and what could be learnt from such breakdowns.  It is imperative that such data be collected and analysed as a matter of priority.  EPIC is calling for a national review of disruptions to maximise early intervention, and that all have a foster link worker.<br\/><br\/>Placement breakdowns should also be challenged.  In EPIC&rsquo;s experience some breakdowns can and should be avoided.  Lack of training and poor management of difficult behavioural situations can lead to damaged relationships.  In foster families this can sometimes result in placement breakdown.  More consistency needs to occur when matching the needs of the child with the strengths and abilities of the foster carers.  Unfortunately this does not always occur.  Furthermore, adequate supports must be provided to children and foster families to ensure that stability and placements are maintained, where possible.<br\/><br\/>Many foster families have lifelong relationships with the children that they foster even after the children leave their home, but some placements do break down and come to abrupt endings.  EPIC believes there should be built in support mechanisms to prevent this from occurring, and that where it does, young people are supported through this difficult transition.  Children approaching their 18th birthday are particularly vulnerable because they are going through a lot in their own lives from sitting leaving certificate exams to aging out of the service.  It is a turbulent time.  They may be pushed to make independent decisions with little support or preparation.  EPIC has experienced several cases of children approaching their 18th birthday and having to abruptly leave their foster placements and move back in with their birth parents on some occasions, who were previously deemed unsuitable carers.  The fact that such decisions cannot be challenged or that supports or interventions did not occur at an earlier stage is unacceptable.  All children experience difficulties and challenges during their teenage years, particularly in the home setting, but these can be more difficult for children and young people in care.  Such problems should be pre-empted and relevant supports provided to avoid the tragic abrupt ending of placements at a crucial time in a young person's life.  If a placement is going to end, child-centred planning must be a priority.  It is not simply a matter of finding another bed for a child.  <br\/><br\/>EPIC is aware that Tusla runs targeted recruitment drives for specialised carers.  Similarly, compulsory training for foster carers does occur but it is EPIC&rsquo;s opinion that more of it should be of a specialised nature.  EPIC recommends for example that Tusla develop a training module on LGBTI issues.  The need for such training is evident through our advocacy work and our publication on this issue entitled &lsquo;Coming Out in Care&rsquo;, which was a collaborative piece of work between EPIC and BeLongTo, was extremely well received.  More consistent support of targeted recruitment of foster carers would be beneficial as children placed in foster care often have specific needs.  More options, for example, for older adolescents going into care, such as supported lodgings, should be promoted.<br\/><br\/>Through our practice, EPIC has noticed that there is an increasing number of younger children under the age of 12 years old being placed in residential care.  We are aware of nine, ten and eleven year olds being placed in residential care.  While there was a dip in the number of younger children going into residential care for a number of years, this appears to have reversed of late.  There was a clear practice by Tusla not to place children under the age of 12 in residential care because it was deemed inappropriate.  If would be of grave concern to EPIC if this was no longer the case.<br\/><br\/>If a child is in care under a voluntary care agreement, Tusla must consider the parents&rsquo; wishes in relation to how aspects of the care are provided.  It is EPIC&rsquo;s opinion that a child who has been in care for a number of years should have their voluntary care agreements reviewed and a decision should be made as to whether or not it is in the child&rsquo;s best interest to remain on a voluntary care agreement or if a full care order should be sought.<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>The birth parents of children on voluntary care agreements can adversely disrupt the lives of their children in foster care, and there are instances where the mothers and fathers, often due to their own personal difficulties, may seek to disrupt their child&rsquo;s foster care placement.  Keeping children on voluntary care agreements in the longer term does not provide the child with a sense of security or permanency in their foster care placement. The following are examples of where birth parents sought to exert control over the lives of their children and the foster family, causing disruption to the detriment of the care placement: a mother insisting that permission should have been sought from her before giving her daughter a birthday cake on her third birthday; a mother insisting the foster carers use her buggy and not the one they already had; a mother refusing to allow her son&rsquo;s very long hair to be cut; and a mother refusing to sign passport forms because she did not want her child going on his first holiday abroad with the foster family. <br\/><br\/>Gaps are noticeable in aftercare planning and service provision for those young people on voluntary arrangements versus full care orders because these supports and services can be court-appointed.  That is very important for young people's transitioning out of care and into aftercare.  Parents of children growing up in foster care have been a largely neglected group in policy, practice and research, in spite of the fact that these parents are often vulnerable adults themselves who experience a profound loss and threat to their identity when their child is taken into care.  Parents&rsquo; involvement through contact is also likely to have an impact on children&rsquo;s stability and security in the foster family.  Where foster parents and birth parents have a good relationship, research has shown that there is a far better outcome for those children.  Birth parents should therefore receive greater supports in dealing with the trauma of having their child taken into care, as well as learning coping mechanisms to help them to focus their attention on what is in the best interests of their child. <br\/><br\/>The recently published HIQA inspection report of Dublin South Central found that foster care reviews were not taking place as required and this presented a significant risk.  This is unacceptable and reviews should occur sooner and more regularly to ensure that the child is being well looked after and that any difficulties are overcome before they escalate.  All children and their foster families should be treated equally in terms of the minimum level of supports that they receive.  Unfortunately this does not always occur with some people receiving a better level of support than others.  Where children require extra interventions the foster families should be supported in providing these.  EPIC recommends that Tusla is adequately funded to have the full complement of staff nationally and that staff receive adequate training to provide these interventions and adequately support young people and their foster families.  <br\/><br\/>All young people should know that they are entitled to make a complaint and how to go about making one.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has developed an outstanding resource known as TACTIC, Teenagers And Children Talking In Care.  These are  packs which should in fact be distributed to every child in care.  These packs are a tremendous resource for children in care, be it residential or foster care.  However, EPIC is aware that this does not always occur.<br\/><br\/>Some 15 fora have been set up around the country by EPIC with the support of Tusla to hear the voice of the child in care.  These are proving to be a great success. One fora with 11 children and young people based in Donegal, for example, is creating and producing a booklet that will be given to all foster carers to fill in prior to a new child or young person moving into their home.  The booklet contains questions and information that young people feel is needed to help support them in moving to a new placement and to alleviate some of the stress and anxiety about the move.  Some of the questions in this booklet include the following: &quot;Do you go to mass and, if so, is this expected of me?&quot;.  &quot;If there is Wi-Fi, what is the code?&quot;.  Who visits the house regularly that does not live there?&quot;.  &quot;Can I decorate my room?&quot;.  &quot;Is the house in the country or in a town?&quot;.  &quot;Do I get extra pocket money if I do chores?&quot;.  &quot;Can I go to events like discos or school trips?&quot;.  &quot;What activities, sports clubs or youth clubs could I join?&quot;.  &quot;What are the top five house rules?&quot;.  These are simple things that young people themselves feel would make their transition into a home easier.  <br\/><br\/>Where possible siblings are placed together in a foster family, but this is not always possible, especially with larger families.  A good level of access with a sibling is considered to be about one visit a month, perhaps for a few hours at a time.  This is not, in our opinion, nearly enough time on which to build a strong and lasting relationship with a sibling.  Siblings should be placed within a maximum radius in order to maximise the opportunity for sibling contact.  This is of particular significance in rural foster care placements because it can greatly impact on the foster carers' ability to support access.  Financial considerations should not be a limiting factor to maximising sibling contact.  This contact is invaluable and must be given greater focus.  For example, 18-plus year olds who are no longer in foster care may not be financially supported to attend sibling contact with younger siblings in care and this makes contact difficult for them to maintain.  <br\/><br\/>EPIC has had experience of several cases where situations were allowed to reach a crisis level before funding was found by the HSE disability services to provide full-time disability support for a young adult leaving care.  It is very welcome that Tusla and the HSE have recently agreed a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration between the Health Service Executive and Tusla Child and Family Agency to promote the best interests of children and families.The new Child Protection and Welfare Strategy also clarifies and sets out the respective roles, duties and legal requirements of the HSE and Tusla in relation to children and vulnerable adults with a disability or mental health issue.  This will help to address many of the co-ordination difficulties and will improve inter-agency working between Tusla and the HSE.  This strategy is a central part of Tusla&rsquo;s ongoing programme of transformation and Epic supports this transformation.  It includes a new national approach to practice, the Signs of Safety.  EPIC looks forward to seeing the impact of such developments on the ground.<\/p><p>EPIC looks forward to seeing the impact of such developments on the ground.  However, EPIC would also like to see dedicated mental health teams, for example, for children in care who should receive a priority on CAMHS lists.  Provisions should always allow for exceptions and flexibility if it is deemed in the best interest of the child and this should be borne in mind in any holistic system.<\/p><p> We have highlighted many of the challenges around foster care that have been brought to our attention through the course of our advocacy work.  However, we also acknowledge the positive developments that continue to occur in foster care in areas such as cultural awareness and identity.  These improvements should be highlighted and EPIC acknowledges all the positive work being done by foster families, foster care organisations, including the Irish Foster Care Association, Tusla and the social workers working directly with these children and families.<\/p><p> I will close our presentation with the words of some children and young people about the positives of foster care: \"I have two families\"; \"My foster brother is funny\"; \"There is another foster child here\"; \"Having someone to talk to\"; \"Getting more presents\"; \"Someone else to talk to\"; \"Having no worries and feeling safe\"; and \"Knowing someone is there for you when things go wrong\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2577,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Charles for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2578,"content":"<p>Ms Charles provided a great deal of information, much of which relates to softer interactions or the communications side, as opposed to hard data.

Some parents will shelter children more, while others will take a much more liberal approach.  Where does Ms Charles find the dividing line?<\/p> <p>  From listening to Ms Charles, there does not appear to be hard data or research on the reasons children move into foster care in the first place.  What are the triggers and issues?  What are the specific reasons?  Are they drug and alcohol addiction, physical and emotional abuse or a combination of factors?  Are there any data available on this issue?  From my work in mental health, I know we are struggling for data and we need to put some analytics behind it. <\/p> <p>  Ms Charles spoke about matching children with the needs of a foster parent.  This reminds me of my work as a recruiter for eight years.  We used to refer to matching as introducing people to people to see who fits with whom and with what job.  Is there any kind of due diligence around that?  Are there any contingency criteria that would best match this or is the system struggling for numbers and trying to find the best place for the child, as opposed to finding the five star treatment, to which I referred, in other words, an exact match?  In other areas, one will always find a 70% or 80% match in terms of culture but obviously when two bodies come together they grow into a new culture.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#D00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2579,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we will have to suspend briefly to allow Deputies to vote in the D&aacute;il.

I want to follow up on some of the points made by Ms Bond from the Irish Foster Care Association.  We all support her view that there is a need for more social workers.  She has made the point that 6% of children in general placements and 8% of children in relative care do not have a dedicated social worker.  I want to follow up on that point and another she made about it being critical to have robust infrastructure in place to support families and ensure knowledge is disseminated among Tusla's staff.  In dealing with crises will she give us a picture of what happens, say, at a weekend when one of the major issues is that there is not an appropriate out-of-hours service available?  I understand that while there is a telephone line service available to access a social worker, the social worker on-call is not part of the local team who might know the circumstances of the family involved.  Could either or both groups give us a picture, from their experience, of the shortcomings in the service and why it is so important to allocate social workers to all children and to have an out-of-hours service available?  A report published this morning by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, highlights the fact that 75% of the calls made to Childline are not made between the office hours of nine-to-five but at other times, including weekends or in the evening.  I want to get an understanding of what it is like for the families and children who find themselves in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I also want to follow up on the points made about after-care plans mentioned by both groups.  I can only imagine what it must be like for a young person who has already had a traumatic life having to leave a home on reaching the age of 18 years.

I have said at previous hearings that our care system would effectively collapse without foster carers.  We are all grateful to them and to EPIC, which is an excellent organisation.  I have had some engagement with it.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions on a few different topics.  The presentation touched on the difference between the costs in the provision of public and private fostering agencies.  There could be two things going on there, or it could be somewhere in the middle.  Is it that it is a wasteful expense and, perhaps, that we are spending too much on these private agencies, is it the case that we are under-investing in the publicly-provided fostering agencies or is it somewhere in the middle?  This would help to get a sense of approximately what it is we should be spending or what would be appropriate.  I would imagine there is an element of under-investment at the very least.<\/p> <p>  The IFCA presentation referred to modifications to homes, which is an interesting point.  Is this along the lines of converting a garage adjacent to the home to accommodate partially independent living?  This is an interesting proposal and would probably not require a huge amount to bring such a policy back into operation.<\/p> <p>  The foster care committees are obviously a big part of the entire regime.  There are major obligations under section 7 of the Child Care Act 1991.  It came across in both presentations that perhaps individual foster carers do not feel they have the kind of support that they necessarily need and that they could go for significant periods without being inspected or visited by foster care committees.  Do our guests feel that the foster care committees are meeting their statutory obligations, is the regime that is in place adequate and do the people on those committees have sufficient training and qualifications to allow them to fulfil their obligations?  It seems that this is a potential weakness in the system.<\/p> <p>  I agree with EPIC.  I would very much support the idea that children under the age of 12 should not be in residential care.  That is not appropriate.<\/p> <p> My final two points relate to aftercare and regulation.  Would the witnesses have a view in respect of the requirement that someone who is leaving care would have to be in full-time education in order to receive aftercare and aftercare payment?  There seems to be a very sharp cut-off point for a person who, hopefully, would have been receiving a substantial amount of support and then, on reaching a particular a birthday after, he or she receives very little support.  This is an issue.<\/p> <p>  My other point comes off the back of the previous set of hearings on this topic with HIQA.  The latter certainly seems to feel that the area of fostering requires regulation, an issue which is outstanding.  It has restricted HIQA's ability to escalate matters where it felt there was risk and to follow up on risks.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on this.  I am mindful of the fact that, obviously, it is important to ensure that children are safeguarded and the highest possible standards but that balance is also in place.  We want regulation to be such that it does not totally discourage people from entering into fostering, particularly as it is such an important function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#J00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2586,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

My colleague from EPIC, Ms Karla Charles, will take the other questions.<\/p> <p>  The national standards for foster care require that children are matched to foster carers.  Every child who enters foster care must have a care plan that outlines all aspects of his or her needs.  Equally, foster carers who are approved through the foster care committees should have certain skills or expertise.  They might be parents of mature, older children and have a lot of parenting under their belt.  They might be parents of younger children with particular expertise in that.  One is, essentially, matching the needs of the child with the skills of the prospective foster carers.  Current regulations allow that a child is placed with foster carers and then a match is made.  What we really need to see is the match happening before the placement occurs.  If a child is coming into care in circumstances where we know his or her explicit needs and where we have a set of foster carers with the skills to meet those needs, this would be the optimum in terms of best practice.  The reality is, however, that often there are not enough foster carers and there are children constantly coming into care.  If we receive a child into care today under an emergency care order, he or she needs to be placed somewhere.  The social work fostering team will see who has capacity today and see how, within the pool of capacity, the child's needs can best be met.  Often the most immediate needs of the child relate to safety and security.  The child is then placed with foster carers.<\/p> <p>  The matching process takes place at a later stage.  The optimum for best practice would be that matching takes place before a child is placed.  If one is looking for a long-term foster care placement, then one is looking at the long-term needs of the child.  However, many children actually come into care on the basis of an emergency care order.  Initially, it would be classified as a short-term placement but then move into long-term placement.  If we have all the resources in place, then we can go for the best practice and go for the gold, but sometimes - on the day and in the moment - we must work with what we have.  If we are working with what we have, then it is about identifying and discussing the needs of the child with the foster carers and discussing how best those foster carers can be supported in meeting the needs of the child.  That might be by attending an additional training course or by higher levels of supervision and support from their link social worker.  This is why it is critical that every foster carer has a link social worker.  If they are experiencing stress in respect of a placement, the foster carers should be able to contact their social worker to discuss the problem and look to see how the foster family can meet the needs of the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2588,"content":"<p>Are there figures regarding how many foster care children there are per social worker?

IFCA looks at the wider infrastructure such as the educational needs and the mental health needs of children in care.  Looking at the core needs, every child coming into care is required to have his or her own social worker.<\/p><p>The child's care plan identifies the needs of the child including any additional educational needs such as a special needs assistant, mental health needs, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy.  When the State takes a child into care, it becomes the corporate parent of the child.  All parents work to ensure that one's child's needs are met.  That should be the standard for every child coming into care.  We would consider the wider infrastructure in that regard.<\/p><p> In terms of dissemination of information, we strongly feel that while policy development is critical and necessary, it does not stop there and there is a process to it.  Everybody who is using a policy needs to know what it is about, what it means, how it is understood and implemented and whether there is a clear and consistent application of the policy across different areas.  There needs to be a parallel process of training of everybody who is going to be using policies along with an evaluation of the policies' impact and whether there is an equal application of policies across the board.<\/p><p> The current practice in regard to emergencies out-of-hours, as noted in Mr. Shannon's report, is that section 12 gives the Garda power to respond to crisis situations after hours.  Tusla has an out-of-hours policy and out-of-hours support is also provided by the Five Rivers private fostering agency.  In a crisis situation, the Garda and the out-of-hours services have responsibility.  Tusla has acknowledged that this is an area it is working on.  The aspiration is to have out-of-hours support across the board.  If a child in foster care absconds, significantly self-harms or has suicidal ideation, there needs to be a common sense approach to consider what is needed for the child.  If he or she has absconded, it is not practical for a foster carer to go roaming the streets looking for him or her; instead, the Garda should be called.  If a child has self-harmed or had suicidal ideation, the most sensible option is to bring the child to the local hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2603,"content":"<p>Can a foster carer contact a social worker directly to discuss issues with him or her?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#K00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496221200,"counter":2604,"content":"<p>There is no current protocol for that.

However, the Deputy is correct in what she says.  I was a foster carer for many years and all the issues seemed to happen at 6 p.m. or  7 p.m. or over the weekend.

It is an emerging trend for many of these young people, while they might be chronologically 18 years of age, to not be at that level developmentally or emotionally because of their adverse early years experiences.  As Ms Charles of EPIC said, a person's chronological age should not be the cut-off date for deciding on their future needs.  In the recent past, several of our foster carer members faced that dilemma.  When Tusla's aftercare policy was developed, the lead implementation person for Tusla came and met with those foster carers to hear of their most immediate needs.  One situation involved a young person with mental health needs who was coming up to legal adulthood and required mental health services.  It went right to the wire, the week of her 18th birthday, before her onward placement was identified.  We are aware from the development of the aftercare policy that aftercare planning will start when the young person is 18 and it is very clearly identified that it is not a one-time life event but a progression.  We need to normalise foster care and children in foster care homes.  We need to ask ourselves whether, if it is good enough for a child in care, would it be good enough for one's own child?  All families naturally have a conversation with their own child regarding what subjects he or she will take after the junior certificate, what his or her interests and hobbies will lead to and what he or she thinks about the leaving certificate and what will happen thereafter.  Those conversations need to be had with all family members in a very natural home environment.  Unfortunately, children in care, when they reach the age of 18, unless in full-time education, are not the responsibility of the State.  However, responsibility must be taken for them because many young people do not have the capacity to be independent at that stage.  The experiences of our foster carers is that such young people stay in the foster care home placement and do not move out because they are still part of the family even though they may not be in full-time education.  That is the dilemma because aftercare is very much centred on the young person remaining in full-time education until he or she is 23.  There are one or two very good models that foster carers have initiated on their own behalf.  A foster carer in Wicklow has built an annex onto the back of her home and has two young women living there who grew up in her foster care and are now mothers themselves.  They are living their own lives independently but still have the wider family network that most families enjoy.  Many children in care do not have the same depth or density of family networks.  We propose that a cost-effective solution be found.  Several years ago, a grant for childminders was made available under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme.  The Government was trying to increase the number of childminders.  Small grants were made available to modify, for example, a garage at the side of a childminder's house or perform another modification to allow them to provide a childminding facility.  This would be a good solution to the continued support of these young, vulnerable people.  Currently, if they move out of home and it is not successful, they become homeless.  Sometimes they go into apartments and forget to pay their rent because they have not developed self-management skills.  We must remember that sometimes the journey for these young people is longer and that while they may be chronologically 18, they are not quite there in terms of their development.  It is a solution in terms of protecting the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about the foster committee.  It is charged with the responsibility of approving foster carers.   Once a foster carer is approved, he or she is allocated a link social worker or that is how it should happen.  The social worker links the fostering department of Tusla and the foster carer.<\/p><p>The role of the link social worker is to provide support to the foster carer, identifying the carer's needs in terms of meeting the needs of the child and also his or her own ongoing training and development needs.  The training of foster care committees was mentioned.  Tusla has just conducted a review of the foster care committee procedures and policies.  Again, IFCA made a comprehensive submission to the development of that policy, highlighting a number of issues in respect of the previous policy.  One of them was the 40-year age gap rule which the Minister, Deputy Zappone actually directed be removed from that policy.  The foster care committee has responsibility for approving foster carers, hearing the outcome of allegations made against foster carers and reviewing placement breakdowns.  It does not have responsibility for day-to-day work with the foster carer.  When a foster carer runs into difficulty, the link social worker is the point of contact.  They play a significant role if we find ourselves in the position of placement breakdown or of an allegation being made against a foster carer. <\/p><p> The new revised foster care guidelines for foster care committees were mentioned.  There is one per Tusla area.  We would certainly recommend that training takes place for all foster care committee members.  When the original policy was developed in 2014, training was rolled out but of course membership of the committees will have changed since then.  It is critical that foster care committees are trained regularly because they play a critical role in deciding whether a foster carer can remain on the panel or whether someone can be approved as a foster carer.

Deputy O'Sullivan raised the need for more social workers.  I am sure the members saw the \"Prime Time\" programme the other night.  There was a social worker on it who said she had a case load of 50 children of whom she was only able to see, on average, about 25 in a month.  That is a clear indication of how many cases she should have.  She should be able to see every one of her young people at least once a month in order to develop a relationship.  We all know that such relationships are key to ensuring the safety and well-being of young people in care.  They should have somebody to go to if they need help or assistance or want to disclose something.  That takes time and investment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Neville was wondering about the caseload that a social worker should have.  It obviously depends on the complexity of the cases, which will vary.  That is where good management and support should come in.  If someone has 15 extremely complex cases, it is enough.  They may have 25, 30 or 40 cases if the needs of the children are less complex.  There are many very happy children living in foster families who are very well supported and looked after.  At certain stages in their lives, they may not need a huge amount of intervention by a social worker.  That relationship still needs to be maintained, however.  Coming back to my point about the turbulent teenage years, if the relationships start to become tumultuous within the foster family, it is important that the young person has developed a relationship with the social worker, who in turn has a relationship with the link worker, who has a relationship with the foster carers.  If these relationships are in place, we can deal with issues, have early intervention and provide training and support to those families.  It is common sense.  It is what all of us would do in our own family situations if our children had problems or issues that needed to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  In terms of numbers, it comes back to management and support depending on the complexity of the cases.  The social worker on Monday night's \"Prime Time\" had 50 cases, which was clearly too much.  We solve the problem not only by recruiting more social workers, but also by investing in them and supporting them.  We have a lot of young social workers who have not been on the job very long and lack experience.  They get overwhelmed because they are not supported.  They are at the front line of raw, sometimes brutal, sensitive and traumatic situations.  They need support in order that they do not burn out, and in order that they are able to develop their expertise and learn to handle situations better as they progress in their careers.  Instead, we have social workers leaving because it is just too much and they get overwhelmed.  We need to retain social workers by way of a number of measures.  Obviously, we need to make sure they are being adequately remunerated.  More important, however, we need to ensure that the infrastructure and supports are there so that they receive proper management and support in dealing with those difficult cases.<\/p> <p>  In terms of aftercare, I concur with everything that Ms Bond has said about supported accommodation for 18 year-olds and the transition period.  We have made numerous submissions on aftercare over the last years.  We brought a group of young people in to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Senator James Reilly.  He had a very frank discussion with them directly.  It is a big problem for EPIC that young people leaving care who are not in full-time education only receive supports until the age of 21.  They are generally the most vulnerable group.  They are the ones who had tumultuous childhoods, were probably in different residential homes and foster families, had very broken educational experiences, may not have done a leaving certificate or, if they did one, did very poorly.  They are not in a position to continue on in education and have not been shown any examples of what areas they could pursue instead.  We have always said that this very vulnerable group of young people needs to be better supported.  To be giving them less support than those in full-time education is counter-intuitive.  It is going to create greater expense for the State and greater problems further on.  Scotland has invested much more significantly than we have and is a good comparative example.  It is now supporting young people up to age 25 and 27 in terms of aftercare supports.  That is a minimum.  Under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, we are supporting young people up to the age of 25, yet we are no longer supporting the most vulnerable of our young people in care at 21 or 23 if they are in full-time education.  I would be very happy to provide more information on this.  We have material up on our website.  We would be very happy to meet with the Deputy in respect of aftercare at another time.<\/p> <p>  On the cost issue of public versus private foster care, the main point I was trying to raise has to do with analysis.  We just need to look at what is being provided by the private foster agencies and what is being provided by Tusla.  The priority must be the well-being of the child in question, regardless of the cost.  If it is going to cost much more in terms of what the private foster companies are providing, then that is what is needed.<\/p><p>However, it has definitely been noted that foster carers prefer to be with a private foster care organisation because they receive better helpline support after hours and their link workers tend to have smaller case numbers.  Therefore, they are going to receive more support.  In terms of the foster carers themselves, they get more support from the private providers than from Tusla currently.  What we really need is greater analysis and a breakdown of what is being provided in those figures.  This is information I have footnoted in my opening submission as coming from an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>recently.  What we need is a great analysis of what that includes.  Does it include the cost of the social worker and payments to foster carers?  It would be beneficial for the committee to raise this as an issue to find out what is being provided and what value for money is being obtained.<br\/><br\/>EPIC sits on two foster care committees.  Our advocacy manager sits on one and another of our advocates sits on the other.  Their feedback is that it is hugely beneficial and that the committees are extremely thorough.  A great deal of time and effort goes in from everyone on them and they are an invaluable resource to have.  I concur with what IFCA said.  It is about ensuring the members on the committees are up to date and are given time.  There is a great deal of background reading and investment from the individuals involved which must go into preparing for each committee meeting and they should be supported in that regard in order that the decisions they make are the right ones.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Neville asked about triggers for young children moving into care.  There is a body of research and data which I will not go into.  Generally, the hard data relate to emotional, physical, sexual and neglect issues.  They are the common reasons.  Tusla holds data on this.  There is a wide and broad body of available data.<br\/><br\/>On the booklets and best practice, we should have all this sorted by now, but we do not.  There is certainly very good practice.  I will defer to my colleague, Ms Guinan, who will talk a little bit more about some of the work we have done in EPIC through some of our fora.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496221200,"counter":2614,"content":"<p>EPIC stands for listening to young people, which is how young people have told us many things around not understanding what care is, the terminology of care reviews and not using age-appropriate language for young people.  Our fora are doing fantastic work in line with Tusla.  Dublin north city is developing an A to Z of words for children who are taken into care.  It is sad in a way what happened in Donegal where the Donegal forum had so many placement breakdowns and emergency moves.  Social workers in that position have two different stresses.  They have to find a bed for a child and to ensure he or she is safe with child protection guidelines being followed.  All the young person wants to know is that he or she is going to another place, what the Wi-Fi code is and whether he or she can eat his or her own food.  It is the things that get lost.  We have to remember that child-centred placements and planning must come first.<\/p> <p>  We tried to get the following clarified before we came.  It is a question we want to ask.  TACTIC and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs developed an amazing booklet which was launched two years ago.  It is a story booklet containing guidelines for children entering care.  It is age appropriate for two different levels of younger and older groups entering foster and residential care.  We would love to see that.  Tusla committed to giving the booklet out for any admission to care but we are not sure that is happening.  We would love if the committee could look into it.  We are just waiting on the answer.  It is an unbelievable resource which, and this is key, was developed over two years by care leavers and people in care who are the best experts.<\/p> <p>  We would love if young people coming into care were told about EPIC and of their entitlement to an independent advocate.  We would love to see our materials forming part of any booklet sent out when admissions to care occur.  That is not happening currently and we have trouble, as do all our sister organisations internationally, accessing children in foster care because of data protection and the gatekeepers.  We have direct access to every residential and special care unit and we provide a visiting service at Oberstown, but we would like to see improvements around our access to children in foster care.

There have to be standard guidelines and best practices.<\/p> <p>  Has the IFCA highlighted regularly the lack of resources and consistency?  Page 10 of its report refers to the lack of correspondence from social care workers.  Surely, the IFCA is part of the chain of engagement and follow-up.  How much social care interaction does it actually get?  We talk about the link worker, but that is for the foster carer.  I am talking about the social care worker for the child in relation to the communication IFCA is getting.  That communication seems to be vital because what came out of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report yesterday was the lack of communication and consistency within the various organisations.  We are dealing with complex cases which may involve not only the family but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies and we need to know the dots are connecting.<\/p> <p>  I attended EPIC's conference last year.  On the voice of the child, they are very clear that we do not listen and that their voices are not being heard.  The one thing that struck me at the conference related to aftercare.

What can the committee do for that gap year if we want to normalise it?<\/p><p>We give the children a gap year in normal circumstances to see what courses they might want to take up, but if they do not proceed to third level at 18, there is nothing for them.  Reference was made to private foster care organisations.  I do not understand the distinction in this regard.  Is it that private foster carers offer a home as opposed to children being placed in an institution?  I need to understand that because that will help me to understand the placement of 12 and 13 year olds.  A 17 year old and a 13 year old are quite different and there is also a significant difference in cost.  When they hit 18 and foster parents want to keep them because there is a bond, they can build an annex and so on.  Does that mean foster children do not get the same opportunity in another set-up?  Where lies the duty of care to the children not just at 18 but into the future on the part of the State?  What is EPIC's vision in this regard?

Their compassion and passion for our vulnerable children comes through clearly.  Does EPIC agree with the statement that, given the emotions of children, institutional care is of a lesser quality than direct foster care in a home?  There has been an increase in the number of children under 12 being placed in institutional care.  Is that due to the lack of foster carers or is there another issue?<\/p> <p>  I refer to difficulties for foster carers with birth parents.  In my experience, if a birth parent has an addiction, for example, the child often ends up with a relative as his or her foster carer.  The carer then gets a knock on the door at 4 a.m. demanding money for drugs or demanding the baby.  That is stressful and frightening and if this happens every two weeks, I imagine the child becomes fearful of his or her parent coming along trying to take him or her away if there is no money.  It is almost like a ransom situation.  It sounds odd but it happens frequently.  The need for foster care is greater in disadvantaged communities, much more so than in other communities, and it is intergenerational.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the 3,000 children who are homeless?  I looked out for two families who were sleeping in their cars when the crisis was beginning to dawn on us several years ago.  If I rang the local authority on their behalf, I was told social workers would be sent out and the children would be taken into care.  That was a frightening response and they treated it as a threat.  That prevented many homeless parents reporting where they were sleeping.  It is different now as these people are accommodated in hotels.  However, I imagine the need for foster care is high among homeless children and I would like the witnesses to clarify the position.  Are there many demands on EPIC's services from homeless families and agencies advocating for them?  I also include refugee children in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report was shocking and distressing.  He urged us all to become aware of the extreme heartbreaking cases that exist, as parents and as a nation.  This raises the issue of whether HIQA needs more enforcement powers in certain circumstances in centres.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the privatisation of foster care, my ideological outlook is that such services should be provided by the public sector in order that they are accountable.  There is a dearth of social workers, nurses and other health and social care professionals in the public system.  The private system seems to have the capacity, especially in nursing, with more terms and conditions and less chaos and stress.  Who would not take a job in this sector?<\/p> <p>  What about investment in the public system?  Linn Dara mental health facility is closing half its beds.  How easy is it for children to access mental health services given it is tough for the adult population?<\/p> <p>  It was well said by Ms Bond that we do not abandon our own children at 18.  They all rely heavily on family networks and we allow them to explore their future from a safe distance.  That has to happen for children who reach the age of 18 in foster care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#N00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2620,"content":"<p>The committee will meet Tusla officials in two weeks.

Many of us know children who stay at home until they are aged 30.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Ms Bond's comments on aftercare and providing on-site accommodation.  Many children in care do not have the wherewithal to live independently.  For example, a foster parent came to my clinic.  She had an adult child exiting care at 18 and was worried about her future.  She had saved every penny of the allowance she had received from the State to buy an apartment for her foster child in order that she could live independently near her.  That is an extraordinary commitment from a foster carer by any standard.  However, the aftercare issue needs to be tackled because every child is headed that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#N00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496221200,"counter":2621,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte referred to aftercare.

They are not the same as their peers in the general population who grow up in loving homes.

If we look at the general population, they tend to leave home, on average, seven to eight years later than children in the care system yet these children have been brought up in supportive and loving environments that have been structured, have been attending school and have been given options, possibilities and examples of how to be confident and contributory members of society.  For the most part, children in care do not have this or have had a certain element of it if they have been lucky enough to get into a wonderful foster family.  Therefore, they need greater supports.  EPIC does not have an upper age limit, so anybody who has had care experience can contact our organisation and receive support.  That is the way it should be.  Even a young person in their late 20s who has been in care and suddenly finds himself or herself at a difficult point in his or her life should have somewhere to turn in order to receive support.  There should be no upper age limit and a downward slope of supports should be provided as young people find their feet.

There are many players on the field.  Every child would have a children-in-care social worker, who is a Tusla-designated social worker, and every foster carer is allocated a link social worker.  No requirement is set down for the number of visits, for example, that there must be 12 visits per year.  In respect of the journey of a placement, if a child is moving into a placement, the initial stages would require high levels of support on the part of the child's social worker with the child and by the link social worker with the foster carer if a foster carer has one.  When the placement has settled down, it might go nicely and contact could involve phone calls or visits.  It would be very important for the child's social worker to see the child at all times.<\/p> <p>  It is important for the child's social worker to come into the family home, to see the environment in which the child is living and to have an opportunity to speak to the child and hear his or her views about his or her placement, such as whether he or she is happy and whether his or her access visits with his or her family are frequent enough.  Equally, it is important for the foster carer to be able to say how things are.  Things could be fine for the moment but, as we know, in family life, we can hit bumps on the road.  A child might be having separation or anxiety problems.  He or she might be experiencing attachment difficulties and he or she may generally be displaying behaviours.  This is, again, when the level of support would need to go up.  One is essentially looking at the level of support for the level of need.  Generally, when children become very settled in placements, it is then that they begin to think \"This is okay, I can be my real self here\".  Sometimes the true self steps up and children can then display all levels of behaviours because they are pushing the foster carers to see whether they will still want them.  It is a case of \"If I do this, will you still want me?\" or \"If I push it another little while, will you still want me?\"  It is about the foster carers and children, particularly the children, finding themselves within the foster care home and finding out where they fit , how much they are wanted and the degree to which this adult will fight for them.  It is complex.  What we are essentially saying is that the needs of the children must be central to everything and all services should be led by the needs of the child.<\/p> <p>  In respect of foster carers and their correspondence with their link social worker, they would not have direct correspondence with the child's own social worker.  Communication would take place through their link social worker.  Foster carers around the country have different experiences, from very high levels of communication to very poor levels.  If I have a difficulty today and need an answer such as whether my child can get consent to go on the school trip next week or an answer regarding a specific aspect of my care, I need it today.  Next week will probably be too late.  What we are asking for is that systems of communication and protocols be developed in respect of how people communicate and are communicated with in return.  Everybody is working to ensure that the placement is successful for the child.  That is everybody's role.<\/p><p>That is an area that has been highlighted through our members on our helpline.  It is probably the source of most frustration.<\/p><p> In terms of the gap year and flexibility, perhaps we should consider not having cut-off ages for children in care.  Again, in terms of normalising, we should always be looking at the norm for every other child when we are benchmarking for children in care.  Often it comes down to the child and his or her ability to engage.  In terms of the aftercare policy on continuing education and a continuation of financial support up until the age of 23, IFCA is clearly stating that we need to see the criteria involved.  Is an apprenticeship acceptable, for example?  If a person starts a course but does not like it - as is the case with many young people - can he or she switch to a different course?  We need to have a degree of flexibility.  A huge amount of thought and consideration has been put into the aftercare policy that has been developed by Tusla.  There has also been extensive consultation on the policy.  Tusla has offered consultation to IFCA members around the country in recent weeks and months.  When the policy is implemented, we will be assessing its impact on the ground.  This comes back to the point we made earlier, namely, if we develop a policy it must be streamlined, people must be trained-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2636,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but we will have to move on.

It is quite disappointing to hear about 12 year olds in residential care because we had moved away from that kind of care provision.<\/p> <p>  Senator Devine asked about relative care and the system to protect relative carers.  Relative carers, like general foster carers, need to have link social workers and to have the same support structures around them.  As we know, the dynamics of family relationships can be quite complex and if a foster carer is caring for his or her grandchildren, for example, a higher degree of protection is required within that relationship.  Families need to be supported and homeless families need higher levels of support.  Children growing up in homelessness is a real tragedy for our society.  Families should not be fearful of having their children taken from them.  We need to be supporting families with their own children.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of HIQA and the regulation of foster care, as EPIC has stated, this is positive and has contributed significantly to improvement of services, particularly for the most vulnerable in our society.  However, regulation in itself does not improve all aspects of services.  Foster care, given the complexities of the relationships involved, is based in relational dynamics and sometimes it is difficult to capture the quantum of what that looks like.  However, recent Government policies including Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the well being indicators for children, children's position within the Constitution and their participation in society should all be taken into account in the context of placing children in care.  There is learning from the implementation of the pre-school regulations, which are now almost 20 years old.  There were lots of teething problems with that because initially it was about regulating the infrastructure.  However, when one is talking about children, one must focus on relational dynamics.  One is actually talking about the quality of relationships and the same is true for foster care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2638,"content":"<p>Senator Devine also asked about refugee children and homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#P00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":2639,"content":"<p>Yes.

Tusla must proactively work to ensure good relationships with partners.  The other main issue for foster carers would be the allocation of link social workers and children-in-care social workers.  Again, we are aware that Tusla is engaged in a recruitment drive.  As the EPIC representatives have said, it is difficult at the moment to recruit social workers.  Recruitment is challenging and then when social workers are recruited, retention issues arise.  We need to evaluate the caseloads of social workers because their work is challenging.

I hope we will cover all of the questions raised, but if we do not, members can let us know.<\/p> <p>  On the provision of services for young people seeking to access mental health services, it is a matter of matching the needs of young people with the services provided.  The provision of mental health services is crucial for children in care.  EPIC would like to see dedicated mental health teams for children in care who should receive priority on CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, lists.  We sometimes find it very difficult to gain timely access to mental health support services for children in care.  That is simply not good enough.  If children in care have to wait six months to one year to access such support, it is too long.  The trauma they have suffered is, therefore, not being dealt with adequately.  Foster families or children in residential care receive support on a day-to-day basis from those around them, but they also need specialised support and intervention services and should not have to wait so long to receive them.  <\/p> <p>  EPIC is a member of the Children's Mental Health Coalition.  I strongly encourage the committee to consider the submissions it has made on mental health needs and into which we have fed with respect to children in care.  We have strong ongoing concerns about sending children outside the State to avail of specialist mental health services and raised the issue many times.  There may be occasions on which it is the best idea to send a child out of the State, but we rely on this option too much when we should be developing greater expertise, if there is a specific mental health issue within the State.  One of the big issues in sending children out of the State for a number of years to receive treatment and support involves their reintegration when they come back when often there is no reintegration plan.  If they return at the age of 18 years, aftercare issues arise.   <\/p> <p> On whether Tusla is fit for purpose, we have all been digesting Geoffrey Shannon's report on the findings of the audit of the use of section 12 of the legislation.  Tusla which is a relatively young body is on the road to reform.  We must have confidence in it because it has made progress.  It is reaching out to agencies such as ours.  It is trying to learn from us and our expertise and that of other agencies.  It is happy to work with us in that regard, which is all very positive.  Unfortunately, however, the rate of progress is a little slow and the public perception is that the agency is constantly reacting to crises.  That is unfortunate because a great deal of good work is being done.  Tusla is on the road to where we want it to be and we have to support it.  That includes support not only from organisations and agencies with which it works but also cross-departmental support.  The review of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures that is taking place should involve an examination of how the HSE, the disability and education sectors can be reinforced to support the work of Tusla, as opposed to people having the view that it is not their job, that it does not involve them, and keeping it all separate because life does not work like that.  The statement it made yesterday is to be supported.  We must ensure it is provided with everything it needs financially to ensure we can put behind us the child protection horrors the country has witnessed in the past and try to move forward.  Unfortunately, there will always be incidents that are unavoidable, but we need to try to ensure they are kept to a minimum.  We can only do that by all working together and supporting this relatively young agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496221200,"counter":2654,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to the Chairman's final two questions.  If representatives of Tusla are to come before the committee, I would raise three points with them.  When we meet young people, they always tell us that they believe they are not listened to and that they are not part of the decisions made about them.  All children in foster care should be listened to and be part of every decision made.  It is about their lives.  Social workers and foster carers move on; the children are the only ones who are static in the process.  Second, as stated by the Irish Foster Care Association, all children in foster care should have a social worker, with whom they would have regular contact, and they should all have a linked social worker.  Third, a quality service of a national standard should be provided - it is evident from our work that there is no national standard - both for the child and the foster family.  It should especially include aftercare services.  A lot of work needs to be put into the aftercare services being delivered.  They are doing great work, but it is not a national service.<\/p> <p>  Core funding for our entire advocacy service is provided by Tusla.  We receive philanthropic funds for research and youth engagement which come primarily from Atlantic Philanthropies.  In later years we have received funding from the Tony Ryan Trust.

There are good models in the United Kingdom in having clusters of foster carers.  It is called the Mockingbird project, as part of which clusters of foster carers come together.  Two or three foster carers provide respite care and it is a little like a wider family network.  Where a foster carer needs support or there is a crisis, there is somebody whom the child knows to provide respite care.  It is normal and natural.  That is a good model that we should consider.<\/p> <p>  On the recommendations the committee could make on our behalf, we certainly recommend a review of national foster care standards.  In response to Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire's question, there are national foster care standards, but they are set down in legislation and what we have is inherent in the difference.<\/p><p>HIQA monitors the implementation of the standards but there are recommendations for change.  The national standards for foster care are now 14 years old and we will call for a review of them to take into consideration the vast range of Government policy change in the past ten years, taking in the rights of children; children's rights within the Constitution; Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures; and national well-being indicators for children.  We could match the well-being indicators for all children and those in foster and residential care, and that would be very tangible work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017053100002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1496221200,"counter":2658,"content":"<p>I have a small point on foster carers and concerns about losing them.  We have to realise that when children are placed in foster care, it is a family home and very often there are other children in that family home.  When we look at regulation, policies and procedures, we must always the safety of the child, which is paramount, with allowing the children to live a normal family life in a family home.  Foster carers must be supported, as Deputy Rabbitte noted, and they need to see a social worker on a regular basis.  The child also needs to see a social worker on a regular basis.  There must be a relationship and every family survives when there is a good relationship in the family home and good communication, with people being able to talk openly about an issue if it arises.  A foster carer must know that no matter what concern he or she might have, whether it is small or big, he or she can go to the link worker about it, be listened to and there would be action.  The child must have a relationship with his or her social worker and be able to talk to the social worker or foster carer if there is a problem.<\/p> <p>  In my fostering experience, very often children in care will divulge information to other children in the family and not necessarily to a foster carer or social worker.  We need to ensure the children of foster carers are supported as well and looked after.  With all the regulation and everything coming down the line, it is getting more difficult for foster carers.  We had a consultation recently where six out of ten foster carers said they would not recommend fostering to another person at this stage.  It is a serious concern for us.  When we examine regulation, we must remember that this involves family homes and we cannot over-regulate that.

I appreciate that the issues before us do not, at first glance, seem to be the most interesting or significant by contrast with those the committee normally deals with.  As members know, the scrutiny of these proposals by the committee is a necessary step in facilitating the moving of the motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which will enable the opt-in to both measures to be exercised.<\/p> <p>  Members are familiar with the legal basis of the proposals before us.  That legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, otherwise known as the Lisbon treaty.  The application of Title V to Ireland is subject to the provisions of Protocol 21, which provides that Ireland shall not take part in the adoption and application by the Council of proposed measures under Title V unless it notifies its wish to do so in accordance with Article 3 of the protocol within three months after the proposal is presented to the Council.  Under the same protocol, Ireland may, at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council under Title V, notify the Council and the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol, that it wishes to accept that measure.<\/p> <p>  Article 4a of the same protocol provides that the opt-in provisions of the protocol also apply to any measure, proposed or adopted under Title V, which amends an Act into which Ireland has already opted.  In this regard, Article 4a applies to both measures we are examining today.  Thus, while on the face of it, the matters before the committee are purely technical in nature, the examination which it is undertaking is an important element in maintaining the integrity of Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty. That protocol is, of course, one which we share with the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the measures themselves, I propose to deal with the proposal for a regulation adapting a number of legal acts in the area of justice providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty.  For the sake of brevity, I will henceforth refer to this as the adaptation regulation.<\/p><p>Article 3 of the protocol applies to this proposal and the relevant three-month period will expire on 13 June.  The proposed adaptation regulation relates to three legislative acts in the justice area.  The justice instruments affected by the proposal concern the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters, the European enforcement order for uncontested claims and the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters.  These are the only justice instruments in the civil area currently in force where an adaptation is required.<\/p><p> The adaptation regulation parallels a large omnibus proposal that seeks to adapt approximately 170 legislative acts across a broad range of sectors.  Separate proposals have been made for legislative acts in the justice sector because, by virtue of the special rules that apply in the justice area, the instruments in question do not bind all member states.  Denmark, for example, is only bound by the regulation concerning the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil or commercial matters.  The background to the adaptation regulation is the need to give effect to the new system set out in Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty, which substantially modifies the framework for powers to be conferred on the Commission by the Council and the European Parliament.<\/p><p> Prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, there was a committee procedure in place whereby acts of the Commission which were of general application and which sought to amend or supplement certain non-essential elements of legal instruments were subject to what was known as \"the regulatory procedure with scrutiny\".  What this meant in practice was there was a mechanism available to deal with necessary adjustments of a technical nature without having to go through the ordinary legislative procedure in every case.  Representatives of the member states had the task of acting as a committee and scrutinising any proposals which the Commission might bring forward and adopting a formal opinion on them.  The kind of proposal allowed for included amendments to various forms where corrections or additions of a minor nature might be required, for example, where a member state adopted the euro as its currency or if some basic information such as a requirement for a postcode had inadvertently been omitted from the original form.  This committee procedure has been superseded by Article 290 of the Lisbon treaty, which provides for a system of delegated acts.  However, the scope of that article is almost identical in terms of the Commission acts which it covers to the acts covered by the old system.  Following protracted negotiations between the EU institutions, agreement was eventually reached in 2016 as to how the system of delegated acts would work in practice.  This is reflected both in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, dated 13 April 2016, and in the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts, which is annexed to that agreement.<\/p><p> Taken together, these documents specify the extent to which the Commission is required to consult experts from the member states - this had been a particularly contentious matter - and the timescales within which various actions are to be taken.  A right of objection to a delegated act is also vested in both the European Parliament and the Council, and certain standard clauses for inclusion in delegated acts have also been agreed.  Negotiations on both the omnibus proposal and the adaptation regulation commenced recently.  Although it is too soon to say how long the negotiating process will take, the justice proposal is due to be discussed some time in June.  The delegation of power to the Commission envisaged by that proposal relates solely to modifying the forms annexed to the three relevant instruments.  In the circumstances, it is desirable that Ireland exercises its right to opt in to this proposal at the outset to ensure we can engage actively in the negotiating process.  As I stated, the three-month period in which we can do so expires on 13 June.  At this time, it is not anticipated that the negotiations relating to the justice proposal will present any particular difficulties for Ireland.<\/p><p> I will turn now to the other measure before us, which is Regulation (EU) 2017\/353, replacing annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015\/848 on insolvency proceedings.  Again, in shorthand terms, we might refer to this for convenience as the insolvency annexes regulation.  Article 4 of the protocol applies to the insolvency annexes regulation, that is, this regulation has already been adopted by the Council on 15 February this year.  It was not possible, for reasons of timing, for Ireland to opt in to this proposal under Article 3 of the protocol, prior to its adoption, and we therefore wish to accept it post adoption, in accordance with the Article 4 of the protocol.  It would be highly desirable that we opt in to the annexes regulation before 26 June 2017 for reasons I will now explain.<\/p><p> The insolvency annexes regulation is a technical update.  It amends the recast insolvency regulation, formally known as Regulation (EU) 2015\/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), whose scope and effect I will set out shortly.  Ireland already opted in to the adoption and application of the recast insolvency regulation, in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol 21, following approval by the D&aacute;il and Seanad on 28 March 2013.  The recast regulation duly entered into force on 26 June 2015 and will apply in member states, including Ireland, from 26 June 2017, except for some provisions relating to national insolvency registers, which will apply in member states on later dates.<\/p><p> Looking first at the scope of the recast regulation, as its name suggests, this measure consolidated earlier EU law going back to 2000.  It is limited to providing an agreed legal framework between EU member states for mutual recognition and enforcement of national insolvency procedures in insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension, such as where an insolvent company or individual has branches or assets in more than one member state.  It sets out agreed common EU rules on which member states' courts will have jurisdiction to deal with the insolvency, which member states' national law will apply, and ensuring court judgments made under the above rules, including appointment of a liquidator, will be recognised in all other member states.<\/p><p> The recast regulation also updates EU law in this area to strengthen recognition of pre-insolvency procedures and debt restructuring.  It sets out new strengthened rules on insolvency proceedings that involve groups of companies based in different member states.  Furthermore, it clarifies and extends the rules on so-called secondary proceedings, where the main insolvency proceedings are before a court in one member state but the company or individual also has a base, with assets or obligations, in a different member state.  The recast regulation is regarded as highly compatible with existing law and practice in Ireland.  Annexes A and B to the recast regulation set out definitive lists for each member state of, respectively, the different types of insolvency proceedings and the different types of insolvency practitioner, such as liquidators, that are accepted by the European Commission and recognised by other member states for recognition under the recast regulation.<\/p><p> As regards the scope of the annexes regulation, it is limited to updating the lists of Polish insolvency procedures and practitioners contained in those annexes to the recast regulation, following a substantial change to Polish insolvency law.  In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission that these changes would take effect at national level on 1 January 2016 and requested that the lists in Annexes A and B to the recast regulation be updated accordingly.  The changes are straightforward and simply reflect the reform of Polish national law.  The annexes regulation was duly presented by the Commission to the Council on 1 June 2016 and was adopted on 15 February 2017.  As I have already said, for reasons of timing it did not prove possible for Ireland to opt in to the adoption of the annexes regulation within three months of 1 June 2016, as required by Article 3.  Recital 4 of the annexes regulation indicates that Ireland is not taking part in its adoption.  This was not inserted due to any difficulties with the content of the measure but simply to reflect the procedural situation that existed.  Accordingly, it is desirable that Ireland should exercise its right to opt in to the annexes regulation post adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol.  It is also important we should do so, if possible, in a timeframe that allows the annexes regulation to take effect in Ireland on 26 June 2017.  That would enable the recast insolvency regulation to enter into force in Ireland this summer in a way that reflects the up-to-date national law in all member states, including Poland.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for making the time available to deal with these matters today.

The Minister and I attended those dialogues.  As a Government and Department, we are committed to an ongoing dialogue with the tourism and hospitality industry as the Brexit negotiations proceed.  The tourism leadership group will meet again in the coming weeks, on 6 July.  That group represents the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, and representatives of the industry.  Brexit has featured and will feature prominently in the discussions.<\/p> <p>  For tourism, the priority issues for the Government are preserving the common travel area, avoiding a hard border on the island, minimising the impact of Brexit on the tourism industry, and maintaining a liberalised aviation regime to protect and promote access, something we have all become accustomed to with the common aviation policies across the EU.  The decline in visitor numbers from Britain is of concern and reflects feedback we have been getting from our Irish industry partners with some softening in bookings from Britain.  Following what was a record year for overseas visitors to the island of Ireland and to this jurisdiction in particular in 2016, recent figures published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showed that overseas visitors from February to April 2017 were slightly up on 2016.  While there was strong growth from the North American market, up by 25.7%, visitors from Britain were down 10.7% year on year.  <\/p> <p>  The sterling depreciation following the Brexit referendum has made Ireland, and every other eurozone country, more expensive for British travellers than was the case previously.  Furthermore, research has indicated that British consumers are likely to scale back on overseas holiday activity this year.  Much of our research is based on work that Tourism Ireland is doing in the market.  The tourism action plan is committed to seeking to restore the tourism marketing fund to pre-recession levels on a phased basis.  Budget 2017 increased funding for the tourism marketing fund and the Minister and I will be seeking further additional funding for next year in order to mitigate any negative effects of Brexit on tourism particularly in the British market.<\/p> <p>  Maintaining the overall competitiveness in our tourism industry is also vital at this time.  While the industry acknowledges its primary responsibility in this regard, I will be endeavouring to assist by seeking to maintain the lower value added tax, VAT, rate for the tourism industry and to keep the air travel tax at zero.  It would be helpful if the committee would add its support to this endeavour.  Tourism Ireland will continue to focus on protecting our market share in Britain, while at the same time seeking to increase diversification into other markets, particularly those that deliver higher tourism revenue.  We are focussing particularly not only on North America but also northern Europe.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working on a number of fronts to assist the diversification and development of our tourism industry and the attractiveness of our tourism product offering through current and capital expenditure.  Work is ongoing to develop the main experience brands, including the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, and to enhance visitor experiences aimed at boosting our appeal to key target markets and priority consumer segments.  Some Deputies have mentioned other areas of the country in the D&aacute;il and in this committee.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland hopes to produce a report on that soon, particularly in respect of the lakelands which have been mentioned at this committee.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness, enterprise capability and sustainability of the tourism sector.  It is creating a new Brexit response programme that will focus on delivering a capability building programme for the industry.<\/p> <p>  The response to Brexit must come from the whole tourism sector, and not just from central Government and the agencies.  It must include local authorities.  I was delighted recently to launch each of the local authority tourism strategies at a tourism conference which the Department facilitated in Enniscorthy, County Wexford.  In the overall picture, there is good performance in numbers of visitors from other markets, particularly North America.  There is still strong sentiment in the industry as per F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism barometer published on 25 May, notwithstanding the fall-off from Great Britain and to a lesser degree from Northern Ireland.  We have to be cautious about the road ahead for the tourism industry given the risks arising from Brexit.  Challenging negotiations will be monitored closely by the Department and the tourism agencies. <\/p> <p>  Turning briefly to sport, the impact of Brexit is still subject to considerable uncertainty.  Anything that would impair or impede the free movement of athletes, sports people, their sports equipment, or indeed their animals, in the case of equestrian events, for example, has a potential to present logistical difficulties that do not currently exist.  Sport Ireland is engaging particularly with this issue.<\/p><p>We are very conscious of the importance of cross-Border co-operation with Northern Ireland in the area of sport.  Some 45 of our national sports governing bodies operate on an all-island basis, which represents about 70% of the total number of such bodies.  Officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport meet on a regular basis with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  There is ongoing discussion between my Department and Sport Ireland to this end also.  There is extensive and effective dialogue on topics of mutual interest relating to sport, and this engagement will continue.  It is best represented by the bid for the Rugby World Cup 2023, and by the preparations for the Women's Rugby World Cup, which will take place later this year.  Through our contacts with the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland and with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in London, we have effective mechanisms already in place to monitor the impact of Brexit on the sporting landscape in Ireland.  For the benefit of the committee, I wish to note that I and my officials have met my British counterpart, Tracey Crouch, M.P.  We travelled to London to meet her in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum and are due to have further engagement with her Department and with stakeholders from the tourism and sport sectors in Britain in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#G01100","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2757,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Senator Feighan are sharing time and have 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#H00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2758,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive opening comments.

The CSO figures released recently show that although overall visitor numbers to Ireland were up in 2016, visits from the UK fell by 10%.  Does the Minister of State believe this is due only to fear of Brexit, or are there other factors at play?<\/p> <p>  Coming from a Border county which relies heavily on tourism, I know more than most the effects that Brexit might bring.  In areas of great natural beauty such as the Cooley region, including Carlingford and the Boyne Valley, tourism plays a major part in the local economy.  The Minister of State mentioned that the tourism action plan is committed to seeking to restore the tourism marketing fund.  Can he elaborate further on this?

In respect of our interactions with Northern Ireland, unfortunately there is not a functioning Executive there at the moment, which is causing its own difficulties.  If anybody can assist in re-establishing a functioning Executive in the North, the Government would welcome that assistance.  In the absence of an Executive, we continue to engage through our embassy, officials in my Department and directly at ministerial level.  I have already had a meeting with my opposite number and I am due to go to London again shortly to meet the stakeholders in respect of Tourism Ireland.  We have already met the Secretary of State with responsibility for culture and media.  We are keeping the option open to have further dialogue.  We have been very conscious of the need to make the British authorities acutely aware of the impact of Brexit on tourism and sports.<\/p> <p>  In respect of sport, the Deputy is right.  We are very anxious to ensure that disruption is minimised.  Sport is a unifying force.  We want to maintain the ease of transition across the Border.  From an athlete's point of view, this would include the movement of sports equipment, animals and people themselves.  Under the direction of John Treacy, Sport Ireland looks after the day-to-day operation of the national governing bodies of sport.  This is obviously playing in to the narrative of how the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is looking at it through the Cabinet sub-committee.  We also need to focus on the very positive work that is being done.  When it comes to the Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup, the GAA or any other sporting organisation, the Irish Government does want difficulties placed in people's way.  That is the basis on which we are approaching the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  On F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I would draw attention to the work it is doing in engaging with local authorities in particular.  I brought legislation through this committee not that long ago in respect of the ceilings for capital expenditure.   The Department and the Government are very anxious to make sure that capital investment through F&aacute;ilte Ireland is maximised in a range of areas and projects.  In the Deputy's own constituency, I recently launched the redevelopment of Carlingford Castle  along with the Office of Public Works.  I have engaged with representatives in County Donegal in the last fortnight and am acutely aware, at both local authority and elected Member levels, of the concerns there.<\/p> <p>  I and my officials have met the new CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We are looking to introduce very basic changes to how festivals are funded, particularly in Border areas that are going to be associated with Brexit to a larger degree than the rest of the State.  We have also ensured that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is aware of our concerns about capital funding.  The two categories of capital grants, both the large and smaller ones, are working their way through the system.  We have to be conscious of the fact that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is an accounting agency.  It receives its funding from the Department and delivers the money based on a needs analysis.  The Department is feeding in from an overall policy point of view, ensuring that we get the best bang for our buck across the country.  I met the new F&aacute;ilte Ireland CEO on a number of occasions and have relayed concerns about capital expenditure in rural communities in particular and also in respect of the development and further expansion of the brands the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  In fairness to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, a lot of announcements have been made and work has started on capital works and brand development.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the drop off in tourism figures from Great Britain, which to a large degree reflects the fall in sterling by about 11% since the original referendum result.  We cannot attribute everything to the drop in sterling, however.  Some of the decline may be due to people deciding to be more patriotic and holiday at home.  All of a sudden, Ireland is competing with Wales, Scotland and the Lake District to a much greater degree than before because of the value for money element.  We have a job to do in terms of attracting the discerning British tourist.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has worked on categorisation with Tourism Ireland so that we know exactly where our visitors come from.  We can identify the magazines and newspapers they read and radio stations they listen to and we advertise on that basis.  We have additional money this year and are going to look for more as part of the Estimates process, to mitigate the drop in numbers.  On 12 June, along with Tourism Ireland, I am going to meet the tour operators that bring people to the island of Ireland.  We will get first-hand information from them as to what they are looking for and what they want to see happening.  In an overall context, tourism numbers are up.  We have a difficulty in respect of Britain.<\/p><p>Emerging markets, however, are also very strong.  Northern Europe is very strong, North America is very strong and we are seeing more air gateways coming in from the Far East.<\/p><p> The tourism leadership group meets on a quarterly basis and is a representative group of the entire industry.  Everybody is equal, the Minister, Deputy Ross chairs and in his absence I chair the group.   We try to get a feel from the industry about what are the issues of concern to them and there are a number including Brexit and training.  Local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the State agencies are there and it is a frank, open and honest discussion.  It really guides policy development and Department focus from a tourism point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#H00800","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2765,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.

The work of the Department and the Minister of State is very welcome in trying to address the issues such as Brexit.  The Minister of State has more or less said that the drop-off would occur due to sterling and value for money and so on.  I grew up at a time, 30 years ago, when we had huge UK business in the fishing in the lakelands of Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan.  I had a newsagents and it had a staple diet of tourism with fishermen who came from the United Kingdom.  Even during the Troubles and the Border, it still made no huge impact and the tourists drank in the pubs and bought their papers and cigarettes and they were very welcome.  That market has totally dried up, I believe partly because of value for money but there were also other markets opening up in Eastern Europe and various places.  It is a market that we seem to have, effectively, forgotten about.  Before I participated in politics I was involved in Lough Key Forest Park.  We got &euro;15 million for its development and it is one of the major tourist attractions.  There is, however, a piece of infrastructure that is now missing.<\/p> <p>  The Wild Atlantic Way is terrific, as is Ireland's Ancient East.  Our area does not have the infrastructure of a hotel.  In any town this gives confidence and it attracts visitors and all the guest houses and restaurants work off that flagship.  All of these types of hotels were built in other towns around the country - places that probably did not need them.  We have a huge tourist attraction and the two hotels in the area are closed.  It is the same in Castlerea and Ballaghaderreen.  Nobody in their right mind will build a hotel unless they get some intervention.  I have discussed this with the Minister for Finance.  If we do not get this tourism infrastructure we will not have the potential.  Is the Government prepared to put in investment - I will not call it a tax incentive - for maybe one hotel? People go away for a few days to Galway, Westport or Carrick-on-Shannon, which is wonderful and is in our area, but we cannot attract those people to the towns I spoke of earlier if we do not have that infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  What is happening is even worse that just not attracting the tourist.  We have communions, christenings, weddings and even funerals having to leave those towns.  We speak of investment, but we now need to look at the smaller tourist towns that missed out on that huge, serious infrastructure investment.  What can been done by the Government in this regard and how does the Minister of State see the future for it? We are currently proposing an initiative called the scattered hotel where, for example, if there was a reception at King House, accommodation would be available through local property owners who would have used an incentive to do up a bedroom.  We do need a serious incentive also.  It does not need to be a five-star hotel but there are towns that are missing out on the great work being done by the Minister of State's Department - and he should take that as a huge compliment - but we would like to be part of that work.  We have King House and the tourist towns, but if we do not have the infrastructure then we are in big trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#J00500","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2769,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with anything that Senator Feighan has said.  I come from Newcastle West in County Limerick and up until recently we did not have a hotel that had any future, and still do not have a functioning hotel.  One of our own who did well in Britain decided to come back and buy the old one, knocked it and it is now under re-construction.  The reason is not too dissimilar to Senator Feighan's comments about a lot of passing trade where there is potential for local use such as communions, weddings and so on.  The Senator is correct to say that the development of any town in the country requires a basic piece of infrastructure such as a hotel.  It is soul destroying for a town when a hotel goes.  The locals see that they cannot hold a meeting, a wedding or a wake for a funeral.  There is no doubt that it is very difficult.<\/p> <p>  Part of what the Senator is referring to can be achieved by some of F&aacute;ite Ireland's initiatives.  Reference was made to the Wild Atlantic Way.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now in the process, with local authorities, of developing loops off that route, the first of which will be in the Shannon Estuary between Limerick and Clare.  In parallel, one will be in the Burren to take people from the Wild Atlantic Way up in to north Clare and south Galway.  Similarly the Mulroy drive, close to the Fanad Peninsula area in Donegal - I am sure the Senator knows it very well - is pretty much ready for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to brand also.  In the west, especially in the counties referred to by the Senator, I believe the potential now needs to be driven through the local authorities and their strategies which, in fairness, I must compliment them on.<\/p> <p>  When I was appointed to this position I have said from the outset that there are areas in the middle of Ireland such as east Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Laois, east Clare, North Tipperary, Limerick and right down into Cork that need assistance.  The assistance should be driven locally by the local authorities, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The blueprint for that is in place because there are strategies now in place.  The local authorities know what they want to try and achieve.<\/p> <p>  From a current expenditure point of view, when it comes to festivals or upskilling people, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been instructed by the Department that we want it to work with local authorities and to engage with them, particularly in those areas that have a deficit in respect of tourism numbers.  The Senator is right when he says there are people who are driving in their droves through County Roscommon.  I drove through it yesterday on my way back from Achill.  There are some fabulous towns and attractions in County Roscommon, no more than there are in County Limerick.  It is about how we attract people in, which is through branding, advertising and the leadership of local authorities.  I thank the CEOs for that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to tax, I am not running down what the Senator is saying, but there were tax incentives for hotels before.  We know some were built in areas where they should not have been built, with the associated problems.  We are now at the other side of it where we do not have enough beds, especially in Dublin, but from a tax point of view we are already doing something.  We reduced the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry and we took a major punt on that.  It was at a time when we had no money to do anything.  We invested in an industry that was basically banjaxed and it wound up with 35,000 additional people working in that industry who never had the prospect of a job.  We now want to spread that benefit.  A lot of people criticised us at the time and said that we should not have done it.  Some people still believe that we should not continue with the reduced VAT rate.  There are some political parties that think we should reverse it.  I do not agree with that idea.  In my part of the country, in the midlands and in parts of the mid-west and north west we still do not have that robustness where we can remove that crutch.  Pre -budget submissions are going to have to be made in the near future from parties and individuals around public expenditure and tax element.<\/p> <p>  The Department would be very open to any consideration, if it is properly costed.  When one has a tax measure in place that is a labour activation measure and it does not receive the support that it should from across the House it makes our job in the Department very difficult if political grandees are on the sidelines looking to have it abolished.  I believe it would be very helpful if we could get consensus on this tax measure in the first place.  If we were to then look at opportunities, be it private investment of public-private partnerships or whatever, I am open to suggestions.  Ultimately, however, tax breaks cost money.  If one introduces a tax incentive, a tax reduction or a tax measure it is money that must be taken out from the central Exchequer pot because it must be paid for and we must ask what is the return on investment?  We know the return on investment for the 9% VAT rate.  It is a lot of people with work who did not have the work before, who have the dignity of it and are able to pay for a mortgage and rear a family.  That is good value for money as far as I am concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#J00600","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2770,"content":"<p>I appreciate what the Minister of State is saying.

There must be some incentive because we missed the boat when every developer worth his or her salt was building houses and a hotel on the side; if it lost money, that did not matter.

The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Canney, and I have realised this and we come from similar parts of the country.  The OPW is the largest landowner in Ireland and the custodian of some of our national monuments that open on a seasonal basis rather than all through the year.  These are located are in the towns to which the Deputy referred, such as Boyle, Frenchpark, Newcastle West, Gort, Ballinasloe, Tuam and elsewhere.  We want to broaden the base so that when somebody drives into Newcastle West or Boyle to find the national monument in the custody of the Office of Public Works is locked because it does not have the money to keep it open, there will be an opportunity for the local community to play a greater role.  The OPW, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is looking at examples where, on a pilot basis, we could extend the period in which facilities are open.  When I was on this committee with the Chairman, we raised the issue continuously.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has drawn the OPW into that as he comes from a part of the country that is similar to ours, with people travelling through east Galway in their tens of thousands to get to Galway, Clifden and Connemara.  He - no more than Senator Feighan and Deputies Troy, Fitzpatrick and Barry, along with me - wants to ensure that rather than having them drive through to traditional places, these people stop in our areas.  It is another initiative at which we are looking.  I am sure the Minister of State and his successor will have no problem coming before the committee to update it on such matters.  I do not have a problem doing so either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#K00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2773,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il.

They are right in that tourism is very exposed to Brexit.  It is the largest indigenous industry in our country, with one in nine people employed in the sector.  The number of people coming from Britain is quite important.  I have great concern about the urgency and priority that the Department is affording this issue.  The Ministers speak about maintaining a liberalised aviation regime.  That is something I will come back to with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  Of trips to the UK, 63% will not happen with an alternative mode of transport if the liberalised aviation open skies policy is not maintained.  That is quite serious.  There are figures for the first quarter of this year indicating an 11% reduction in the number of visitors coming from Britain.  In 2016, &pound;1.3 billion was spent in our economy, with &pound;1 billion of this coming directly from the UK.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions about what exactly has been done.  The leadership group will meet again in the coming weeks but when was that group established and what exactly is its purpose?  What is the configuration of the group?  The Minister is aware that the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation published a document on its concerns about tourism, highlighting what the Government has done in other areas, including with Bord Bia, which has a &euro;150 million emergency fund and &euro;2 million for additional funding and strategies to support the Irish food and drinks industry.  There has also been a market identification programme, the doubling of one-to-one mentoring and an increase in the number of market and consumer research insight programmes and more trade events.  Enterprise Ireland has &euro;3 million in additional funding, with 39 additional staff, although I note from yesterday's paper that these are not yet nearly filled.  There is an export finance initiative, increased trade missions, market diversification programmes, nine additional IDA Ireland staff and increased promotion.<\/p><p>When we look at Tourism Ireland, we see it has no additional staff, no real increase in budgets and no enterprise or Brexit support programmes.  Is the Minister of State serious about the challenges facing this crucial sector of our economy?  I acknowledge good decisions were taken by the previous Government on the abolition of the travel tax and the reduction of VAT.  In the Minister of State's opening remarks, he identified the retention of the 9% VAT rate as a key proposal and criticised certain parties for not supporting it.  We support it, but I ask him to confirm it will be maintained in the upcoming budget.  Clarification and certainty for the industry are very important.<\/p><p> The committee agreed to forgo the pre-legislative scrutiny on legislation to help with the World Cup bid, which is very important.  It is an all-Ireland bid.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the absence of an Executive in the North is having a negative effect on it?  While it is not totally related to Brexit, will the Minister of State comment on the current saga in the boxing association, given it is the number one or two story in the news agenda today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#O00100","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2778,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for his questions and comments and for his support for the industry.  It is important to point out Tourism Ireland is a North-South body funded by the Government here and by the Northern Executive.  We fund on the basis of two thirds to one third.  Comparisons can be made with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but, to be honest about it, it is apples and oranges because to a large degree Tourism Ireland has an all-island remit.  Certainly the absence of a functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland is concerning from a tourism point of view.  As I said earlier, committee members have much more influence to bring to bear on the re-establishment of a Northern Executive, and the sooner it happens the better from our point of view and from Tourism Ireland's point of view.  There is a new chairperson and we wish her well.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right the tourism marketing fund has come from a pre-recession level of &euro;55 million and stands at &euro;36 million.  This is not an insignificant sum of money, but we need to bear in mind the decrease from &euro;55 million to &euro;36 million, which represents a drop of approximately &euro;20 million, also coincided with decreases in every element of public expenditure.  We are putting in place a trajectory to bring it back to pre-recession levels.  This will take time, and it is about ensuring we can get that level of support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from the whole of Government.  It is important to bear in mind that in the intervening period, when the tourism marketing fund was under enormous pressure, growth in the tourism industry exceeded all expectations.  The was much criticism at the time of the development and implementation of People, Place and Policy for lacking ambition.  We stated we expected to have 250,000 people working in the industry by 2025 and to have in excess of 12 million visitors.  We know these figures will be exceeded.  What we want to do is ensure the fund is enhanced as quickly as possible.  This will have to happen on an incremental basis because there are other demands in the Department and in the Government.  It is not for lack of leadership from the Department, certainly at official and ministerial level.  The whole of Government is acutely aware of it.  The Deputy is right that the 230,000 people employed in the industry represent approximately 9.5% of total employment in the State.  This figure has increased by 35,000 since we went into Government in 2011.<\/p> <p>  The tourism leadership group predates our time in the Department.  It has been there since the previous Government.  It was under the stewardship of the former Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and, latterly, Deputies Varadkar and Ring.  As I said to Deputy Fitzpatrick, it is an advisory group to the Department on issues confronting the sector as a whole.  It enables open and frank dialogue between us, the Department, the Ministers, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and representatives of the industry.  It has covered a range of issues in our time there, including hotel accommodation constraints in Dublin, and much positive work is happening.  We have engaged with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the banks to see what is the exact situation, rather than anecdotal evidence, on the provision of additional accommodation in Dublin, and progress is being made.  It has also discussed the value or otherwise of some of the schemes, such as those relating to the regional access fund or training and the existing leadership, and Brexit forms part of this.<\/p> <p>  I have met the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on a number of occasions.  It would be failing in its duty if it did not raise issues of concern to the industry.  The Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and a number of other organisations, including those representing tour operators and coach operators, have also raised issues.  I have met pretty much all the stakeholders at this stage, individually and collectively, and I meet them regularly through the tourism leadership group and at unofficial and official organised events.  They know I have an open door policy and there is no issue about communication.<\/p> <p>  With regard to market intensification, the Deputy needs to take the whole picture and look at the phenomenal work Tourism Ireland does every year for St. Patrick's Day in terms of Government representatives and the diplomatic corps elsewhere.  If we look at the type of marketability done there, the greening has been a phenomenal success.  It gets huge traction in emerging markets.  I saw it in Australia and New Zealand.  We had 200,000 visitors last year from Australia and we want to increase this.  It is an emerging market.  Qatar Airways will open into Dublin shortly.  Etihad Airways is running double daily flights.  Emirates is also looking at expanding its presence in Dublin airport with A380s.  Many very positive things are happening in these markets.<\/p> <p>  In northern Europe, Tourism Ireland has a very heavy presence in France, the Benelux countries and Germany,  These were referred to earlier as traditional markets.  We cannot drag people here from the United Kingdom.  We cannot tell people they must holiday in a particular place.  We can advertise and market and we do this under a number of headings.  We know one of our greatest attributes is the culturally curious person who is looking at a whole package such as the sights of Ireland's Ancient East.  We also have city breakers, those coming for short breaks to cities such as Galway or Dublin.  We know their spending model and we can identify it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has done work, for example, with Richard E. Grant, on penetrating the direct actual market audience in magazines, newspapers and social media platforms.  Social media has proven to be massively successful with regard to \"Star Wars\".  Skellig Michael and the Donegal coastline are among the most important attributes.<\/p> <p>  Tourism Ireland is functioning in a very strong and robust market.  The British market is very competitive.  I attended the world travel market and could see this very clearly.  It is a showcase for the entire world looking to book seats to their destination.  It is extremely competitive, particularly in Great Britain from a domestic point of view.  There are offerings, such as the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District and the Welsh mountains, that people, especially those from the south east of England, now look at in the same way as heretofore they may have looked at Ireland.  We cannot ignore the fact that 11% of the value of their currency has been wiped off.  This reduces their spending power by 11%.  If it means they can get value for money in Britain, we must make sure we demonstrate they can get as good, if not better, value for money in Ireland.  In the tourism leadership group we have been very clear as Ministers that, in particular, we need to keep an eye on Dublin hotel prices, transport costs in the private sector as much as the public sector, and a range of costs, particularly regarding visitor attractions.<\/p><p>The Irish Hotels Federation has provided us with regular information.  We have been at pains to point out the responsibility there.  I spoke to vintners in the Deputy's constituency recently.  One of the things we are very concerned about is competitiveness.  We do not want to get back to the field we were in before where Ireland had a reputation of gouging.  We do not want to be in a situation where tourists coming to Ireland feel they do not get value for money.  We are at pains to work with the industry.  I have already been to the UK on a number of occasions.  I have attended trade missions in Florida and Atlanta in the United States, and in Australia, New Zealand and Britain.  I will continue doing that because, apart from anything else, the leadership the Department can provide the industry is very important.  Industry roadshows happen on a continual basis.  The Deputy mentioned trade missions.  They are essentially the same thing.  The industry goes into a particular city, sets up shop and the buyers come in.  When the Minister is present, it makes a big difference.  It is my role and I make no apology for it.  People criticise Ministers for travelling, but it is my job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#P00200","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2780,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Troy to come back in for a follow-up question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#Q00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2781,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has given a great overview of what the Department is doing and he has identified the challenges Brexit presents.

I have said it to Deputy Fitzpatrick and I will say it again that we are not the Department of Finance.  That Department has competing demands.  The Minister for Finance and I believe the 9% VAT rate is necessary in terms of the continuing development of the tourism product, particularly in provincial Ireland.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there are competing demands for Exchequer funds.  There is also the realisation that in Dublin in particular the industry is doing exceptionally well.

When there is a functioning Administration in Northern Ireland, I would love to see a realisation that it is in the island of Ireland's interest for the fund to be increased.  We cannot work in a silo any more than Waterways Ireland can.  The Deputy knows that.  Tourism Ireland is covered by that.  It is not in any way an insignificant amount of money.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we were doing in the emerging markets.  I responded to Senator Feighan, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Troy on the presence Tourism Ireland can successfully demonstrate through the market return from the North American, northern European and emerging markets.  We have a very strong presence there which I know because I have been there.  The figures speak for themselves.  We cannot run away from the fact the currency in the United Kingdom has devalued by 11%.  We also know from other markets that it is not unique to Ireland.  Other eurozone countries are also experiencing drops in markets.  Destinations such as those of the new and emerging markets in North America, Australia and New Zealand also have concerns about British overseas tourists who represent a very significant portion.  We will continue to do what we have done since the Brexit referendum.<\/p> <p>  It is not true we do not have a Brexit leadership group.  The tourism leadership group predates my time and that of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the Department.

The issue of visa entries will form part of the overall Brexit negotiations to take place with the European Union.  The common visa situation is a recent development in many cases.  It was developed to ease access into Ireland.  It facilitates and suits us because Ireland does not have a diplomatic presence in many Asian countries.

The Minister of State made reference to the castle in Carlingford and its development is very welcome.  However, there are other parts of County Louth that have been seriously neglected and while the OPW has been working on one or two historical buildings with a view to opening them to the public, there is a lack of funding and investment to encourage and develop tourism in pockets along the Ancient East.

I can give another example of a new tourism initiative on the Fanad Peninsula in Donegal, another Border county, which I visited recently to see the work being done by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Donegal County Council.  I go back to the original point I made which is that local authorities have, for the first time, developed tourism strategies and I must pay tribute to the County Manager in Count Louth, in that context.  Recently we launched the tourism investment strategy in Newgrange for sites in both Louth and Meath but no Members of the Oireachtas attended the launch.  We announced the capital investment programme for Louth and Meath in the presence of the Meath County Manager and the tourism officer for the Louth, Meath region.  The Louth, Meath region has been to the fore with regard to the development of a destination plan, which is very important.  The counties are collaborating well together.  As I said at the outset, the CEOs of local authorities and, more importantly, local councillors cannot look at tourism as something in which they might get involved.  The Local Government Act makes it clear that tourism is something they must consider in terms of spending their own resources as well as accessing resources for current expenditure on things like branding, festivals and so forth, as well as capital funding.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier to Deputy Fitzpatrick, where F&aacute;ilte Ireland sees a commitment from local authorities, I have encouraged it to look at those local authorities that have particular needs and deficits.  One of the things that Louth and Meath do not have, for example, is an underdeveloped hotel sector.  They have a very well developed hotel sector, with some of the finest hotels in the country in those locations.  I have spent time in those counties and Deputy Fitzpatrick will attest to the fact that I called on him, unsolicited, one day.  In terms of both  accommodation and dining opportunities, I am very familiar with the quality of the offering.  <\/p> <p>  However, it will not be down to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to magic up something for an area.  Local authorities, local councillors and Leader companies all have a role within the tourism strategies which have been launched and adopted.  What the Department wants to see on an annual basis is a statement of delivery.  Such a statement should include details of what was done in the previous year and the plans for the coming year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department will reciprocate, based on that.  It is also important to point to the development of the greenway strategy.  Up until the time that myself and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, were appointed there was no strategy for the development of greenways.  Everybody and anybody was involved.  The OPW, the NPWS, the county councils, the Department itself, Coillte and others had a role in the development of greenways.  I met representatives of the Louth, Meath area recently and they are very anxious to develop a greenway network in that region but that can only be done on the basis of strategic investment in a planned and organised fashion.

Last year the principle of the EU negotiating directly was approved at the General Affairs Council.  This clears the way on the EU side for the commencement of the negotiations.  The next major milestone is the forthcoming UK general election, after which I understand Mr. Barnier and his team are seeking to commence the first round of talks during the week beginning 19 June.<\/p><p>In line with the agreed negotiation guidelines and mandate, the initial focus of the negotiations will be on the withdrawal agreement and after sufficient progress is achieved in this phase of the negotiations, it will be followed by negotiations on the future relationship.<\/p><p> Along with all other Departments, my Department has prepared for the commencement of the negotiations and has consulted widely in identifying the issues of importance to the transport and tourism sectors.  My colleague, the Minister of State, has referred to tourism.  With regard to transport, there is general consensus across all operators and users that any additional barriers, be they physical, regulatory or technical, to the current access arrangements between the UK and Ireland, including North and South, will be detrimental to them and to the overall economy.  The key issues for the sector are the maintenance of the common travel area; the maintenance, as far as possible, of existing common standards and regulatory regimes; the avoidance of a hard border between North and South, and the most efficient customs arrangement on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain; the protection of the fully liberalised and deregulated aviation market; ensuring current aviation traffic rights are not adversely affected by the UK exit with respect to their various air transport markets; and equal treatment of EU and UK airlines as well as UK and EU nationals in respect of ownership and control rules.<\/p><p> With respect to sector-specific concerns, the UK's exit from the EU and the single aviation market means that a new EU-UK aviation agreement between the remaining 27 member states and the UK will have to be negotiated.  Brexit, unless accompanied by some form of agreement replacing the impacted traffic rights and associated regulations, will affect the existing rights of Irish licensed airlines to fly between the UK and the EU, within the UK, and between the UK and a range of other countries, including the US and Morocco.  Specific political consent will be required for existing traffic rights to remain available and the desired end is for a comprehensive EU-UK agreement to be reached.  Uncertainty regarding traffic rights is exacerbated by ownership rules affecting Irish airlines.  To retain an EU airline licence and access to the EU single aviation market, an airline must be majority owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals.  It is also essential that robust transitional arrangement bridging the gap between a withdrawal agreement and a future relationship agreement are put in place to provide clarity and certainty for the sector and to ensure continuity of services.<\/p><p> Any negative impact on bilateral trade flows will impact on ports and shipping.  The UK has signalled it does not expect to be part of the EU customs union and, therefore, any additional levies or tariffs that may be introduced may divert goods to EU markets away from the UK and may depress Ireland's overall exports.  Reintroduction of border controls for freight together with additional administrative requirements would have a significant negative impact on the cost and efficiency of the transit goods through ports and a significant impact on the capacity of ports as a result of the likely negative impact on land utilisation and other port infrastructure.<\/p><p> Irish haulage and passenger operators who hold a Community licence have access to the EU market, including the UK and Northern Ireland.  It is unclear how Irish road transport operators will be able to access the UK and Northern Ireland post-Brexit.  Issues will also arise regarding road transport regulatory requirements post-Brexit when the UK will no longer be governed by EU legislation in this area.  A significant proportion of goods destined for EU markets use the UK land-bridge to access these markets.  Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the land-bridge routes, particularly where there are increased border and customs procedures and delays or where the UK may subsequently apply different standards, road charging or regulatory regimes.  Current alternatives to the UK land-bridge are regarded as slower and lacking capacity.  My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, is planning to undertake a study shortly into the UK land-bridge to help inform our negotiating position.  There is also considerable cross-Border traffic with hauliers operating on both sides of the Border.  They currently may make multiple crossings in a day.  Border controls could significantly disrupt these operations or render them unfeasible.  Employment and cabotage will also emerge as road haulage issues.  UK drivers will be considered to be non-EU and, therefore, work permits may be required, leading to potential driver shortages.<\/p><p> Irish bus and coach operators travelling to the UK or transiting through the UK to access continental Europe could be faced with increases in costs and restrictions on carrying out public transport cabotage operations in the UK.  Picking up and setting down passengers as part of a cross-Border trip is particularly an issue for services to and from Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> As part of my Department's preparations for Brexit, there has been wide engagement with sectoral stakeholders and there are established stakeholder fora in the tourism, aviation, maritime, public transport and road haulage freight areas to consider the implications of Brexit for these sectors.  Two major workshops have taken place.  Along with the Minister of State, and as referred to by him, earlier this year I hosted an all-island dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the transport and logistics, and tourism and hospitality sectors and, in April, my Department hosted a workshop on the impact of Brexit on maritime transport regulation.<\/p><p> In addition to Irish stakeholder consultation, we are seeking to deepen and broaden our alliances with the EU institutions and individual member states and continue to work to ensure they are fully mindful of and aware of core Irish concerns on various issues in the transport sector.  Such alliance building and positioning will require a concerted effort on our part seeking issue-specific coalitions often within individual sectors and policy areas.  As set out in the EU guidelines for the negotiations, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required.  Our absolute preference is to maintain the closest trading relationship based on a level playing field between the UK and EU, including Ireland.  What happens with Brexit will influence the transport and tourism sectors for decades to come and there will be much to do over the coming period to achieve the outcomes we want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#S01300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2837,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive report on Brexit.  I am glad he stated it was not an Irish decision for the UK to leave the EU.  It is the result of a Tory feud and it is the UK's decision to leave.  I am glad the Government is committed to the Single Market, the euro and low corporation tax.  The Minister said the first round of talks will take place on 19 June.  What opportunities does he see with the UK leaving?  Foreign direct investment in the UK amounts to approximately &euro;35 billion a year while the equivalent investment in Ireland is approximately &euro;5 billion.  The IDA, Enterprise Ireland the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are working hard to get as many companies from the EU as they can to set up in Ireland.  What opportunities does this present?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the currency issue earlier.  There has been an 11% reduction in the number of UK tourists visiting Ireland.  The fluctuation in sterling has been a major factor.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to a hard border.  I come from Dundalk, a Border town, and there is a great deal of concern about what will happen.  The Minister said additional barriers and customs procedures may be put in place.  What comfort can he give to the transport industry in the Border region?<\/p> <p>  The Government has committed &euro;50 million to the A5 motorway project in Northern Ireland.  If a hard border is put in place with customs posts, will the Government proceed with this investment?  There is a great deal of discussion in the Houses about providing money for health and disabilities and so on.  However, if there is a hard border, &euro;50 million would go a long way towards addressing these problems.  The Minister of State said the inactivity in the Northern Ireland Assembly is not helping the caused at the moment.  What is the Minister's view on this?  A few weeks ago, Newry Chamber of Commerce &amp;amp; Trade visited Dundalk.<\/p><p>We heard from them that the only people showing any concern about Northern Ireland is the Irish Government.  The background is that the Assembly is not operating and an election is under way in the United Kingdom.  Does the Minister have an opinion on that issue?<\/p><p> Much is being said about aviation, traffic rights and so on.  While the Minister stated this should not affect Ireland, a high profile individual involved in airline companies in Ireland stated this will cause problems.  More than 200,000 people are employed in sectors that trade with the United Kingdom.  Irish airports operate flights to London, Liverpool, Manchester and other UK cities.  We will negotiate our rights as part of the European Union.  I would not like anything to disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK.  Will the Minister provide an update on the position in Ireland regarding aviation rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#T00200","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2839,"content":"<p>I will take the questions one by one.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct that the decision on Brexit was not taken by Ireland and it is not one we would take voluntarily.  The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has landed us in a fair number of negatives.  There is no point in arguing that Brexit has many positives which are immediately apparent, although it is fashionable to try to find some.  On the whole, particularly in the transport sector, Brexit is a negative.  We are seeking to protect our interests and ensure the minimum amount of change from the status quo in the negotiations.  In that sense, it is difficult to find positives.<\/p> <p>  There will be some benefits as UK companies or companies from elsewhere relocate to Ireland.  This may deliver benefits for the financial services and insurance sectors as companies decide they do not want to be located in the UK.  IDA Ireland and other bodies have targeted companies, including financial institutions, in an effort to have them locate here.  Overseas and multinational companies may have taken a decision to locate in Ireland because they do not want to locate in the UK for obvious reasons.  We have linguistic advantages as Ireland will soon be the only English speaking country in the European Union.  That is a plus but when I look for pluses, I am clutching at straws to some extent.<\/p> <p>  Most of our energy post-Brexit is focused on protecting the interests that are threatened by Britain leaving the EU, man of which the Deputy eloquently identified.  We are also focused on shielding the country from the unknown, which is possibly the most frightening aspect of Brexit.  I refer in particular to aviation, an area the Deputy highlighted.  This issue is extremely alarming and we must rapidly take measures to ensure the sector is not affected in the way that has been outlined. <\/p> <p>  In terms of offering the Deputy comfort a substantial amount of work is being done on the issue of a hard Border and the dangers it presents.  Alternatives are being considered and officials have been examining what has been done in other countries such as Sweden and Norway.  Political decisions and technology will move together.  We hope that if Britain leaves the customs union, as I assume it will, and Border controls are introduced, the most modern technology will be implemented to ensure a minimum of disruption and disturbance for those crossing the Border, whether tourists, traders, freight and so on.  It is intended that we have a smooth operation of the Border, particularly in County Louth, Deputy Fitzpatrick's home area, and similar areas.  It is unthinkable that we would return to the days of queues at the Border because that would disrupt the frenzied cross-Border activity that takes place.  I say with some confidence, although I do not wish to give a hostage to fortune, that the research being done on this issue will ensure that if Border controls are introduced and customs or other delays become necessary, this will be done in the most sophisticated way possible.  All the indications are that the technology will follow the political decisions and it will be fairly sophisticated.  I hope I have given the Deputy some comfort on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked for an update on the position regarding the airlines.  The most honest update I can give is that this is the most pressing, acute and worrying problem for Ireland in view of Brexit because of the open skies agreements and the EU aviation market.  If Britain were to withdraw from the European Union, it would, on the same day, leave the EU aviation market and we must be prepared for this eventuality.  The imperative is to negotiate a new agreement with new rules between the 27 member states, of which Ireland is one, and the United Kingdom.  It will not be a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK.  It would be unacceptable if that were not to happen.  From my discussions with others in the aviation industry, the intention is to have transitional arrangements after the UK withdraws from the EU.  I hope these will be as close as possible to the current arrangements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#U00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2840,"content":"<p>I asked a question on the proposed upgrade of the A5 road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017053100002#U00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1496217600,"counter":2841,"content":"<p>I do not see any danger to that project, which is part of the agreement with Northern Ireland.

Was the Government or the Department prepared to accept something like that, given the magnitude of what is at stake, that if customs posts were reinstated, we would need not to worry as they would involve the use of the highest technology and that delays would be minimised?

That would be a very long period in which to have no talks on the Open Skies agreement because the United Kingdom will come out of the agreement - the EU Aviation Single Market - automatically when it leaves the European Union.  There is, however, a provision for a framework to be put in place because of the urgency of what the Deputy is talking about in order that arrangements will be made for a transitional arrangement to the Open Skies agreement.  There are talks under way.  When I spoke to Chris Grayling last week, aviation was top of the agenda because the matter was so urgent.  Our objective is to ensure there will be as little change as possible in the context of the Open Skies agreement and that we will have an input into the talks early on - it must be remembered that Ireland is one of 27 member states and that we are not on the United Kingdom's side - in order that a transitional arrangement will be in place on the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

There is not a single bus driver, to my knowledge &ndash; I know a lot of them &ndash; who voted in favour of the package because they felt it was a positive option for them, their families or the future of the company.  Without exception, the men and women I know who voted for it did so because they felt that a gun had been put to their heads.  They felt that the threat of examinership was so serious that this time there was no alternative but to vote for the package.  That was the feeling among employees.<\/p><p>I compliment all of them on the stand they took.  The pay cuts and pension situation would have been significantly worse if they had not taken that stand.  It is to their credit that they fought their corner so well.  I will leave those points there.<\/p><p>I am not sure if whether when the Minister says that proposing to put more than 10% of the company's services out to tender is extremely provocative, he feels that the Minister for Social Protection's comments were extremely provocative because the Minister for Social Protection has made his position clear on that.  The Minister might like to clarify that point.  <\/p><p> On the immediate issues, in respect of funding for PSO, the Minister says we will see the colour of the money in budget 2018.  We will watch that with great interest.  On the question of free travel, the Minister says that this examination is ongoing but an important principle has already been agreed that all commercial operators, including Expressway, should be treated and compensated in the same manner under the scheme.  I am asking the Minister to clarify that.  Discrimination in favour of the private operators over and above Bus &Eacute;ireann in terms of the way that scheme is administered exists.
