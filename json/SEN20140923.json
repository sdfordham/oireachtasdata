Was it on Joe Duffy's radio show yesterday?<\/p><p>On a number of occasions, Senators on both sides of the House, including Senator Gilroy in particular, have raised the issue of early intervention for children with special needs who need speech and language therapy.  I assume most Members saw the Inclusion Ireland report last week which highlighted the fact that 15,000 children in the country are languishing on waiting lists and cannot access any services.  Kids with special needs need help to set them in the right direction and ensure they reach their maximum potential and get support.  In all parts of the country things are at crisis point, and this is more acute on the east coast and in Dublin, where there are no early intervention teams.  The Government closed the waiting list from June 2012 in the north city and county area of Dublin.  Children cannot be added to a waiting list to access speech and language therapy.<\/p><p>No one on the Government benches agrees that this is acceptable.  It is unacceptable that we must continue to talk about this.  I have raised the matter on numerous occasions, as have Members on all sides, but we are getting nowhere and nothing is being done.  This matter lies with the Department of Health, and it is too serious to let the situation continue.  We cannot raise this today and then talk about it in a few weeks' time when another report is issued.  We are lucky because we have the ability to speak about this and put across our points.  Many of the children who are waiting for initial assessment for speech and language therapy are unable to do what I am doing.  What I am doing this afternoon is speaking on their behalf.  If we are serious about building a fair society even in the toughest times, surely urgent funding can be put in place to resource the teams.  In the north Dublin area, 2,258 children have been waiting since June 2012 to get an initial assessment, and no one has been added to the waiting list since then.  Of the 15,000 children countrywide, God knows what is the real figure.<\/p><p>I am not tabling an amendment to Order of Business by way of confrontation but to insist that the Minister for Health come to the House to outline the Government's plans in this regard and to explain how we will tackle the waiting lists.  Irish people are inherently fair, and if we said we would need &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million to properly resource the teams and put a specific emphasis on reducing waiting lists, people would not have a problem saying that we could not do such and such another thing because the money was needed to resource these teams.  It cannot be allowed to continue.  I have met parents who were being funded by charities to pay the initial fee for the occupational therapy report.  They cannot afford it.<\/p><p>If we are serious about this, let us agree that if the Leader will not accept the amendment to the Order of Business, he will set aside specific time next week to get the Minister into the House to hear our case and outline his case in a non-confrontational manner.<\/p> <p>We should work on this together.  It has been raised in the House on numerous occasions.  All of us want to see this situation improved upon.  It is so urgent that we cannot simply continue to talk about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300003#B00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411479300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the positive economic figures that have been published in recent weeks.  In particular I welcome the comments of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, make this morning before the Cabinet meeting to the effect that this is the best pre-budget position the country has been in for six years.  For the first time in a long time we are seeing positive indicators going into a budget.  I hope this means the health, education and social welfare budgets will be protected and that we will not see cuts in those services.<\/p><p>The Leader will respond to Senator O'Brien's amendment call, but I share his concern, as does everyone in the House.  Senator O'Brien has fairly referred to the long delays and the Inclusion Ireland report about the lack of access to speech and language therapists.  It is appalling.  It is not new in the sense that we have seen such delays in the system.  We have seen a lack of recruitment as well.  One key issue is simply a shortage of skilled personnel who are able to carry out the assessments and provide the appointments.  We need to see urgent action taken on this matter.  I absolutely agree with Senator O'Brien on this - I imagine everyone in the House would agree on it.  I would like to see us having an early debate on the matter, even if it cannot be facilitated today.<\/p><p>On a lighter note, I wish all those involved in the ploughing championships this week well.  It is expected that 200,000 people will visit the championships  It is an important showcase for Irish agriculture, agribusiness, the food business and artisan food producers as well.  It is a positive event this week.<\/p><p>Will the Leader consider arranging an early debate on climate change following the meeting that has been convened by the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in New York today?  It is a meeting of world leaders to look at trying to break through the obstacles preventing the taking of serious action on climate change.  It is a welcome initiative.  He has broken out of the normal structures of UN meetings on climate change to call this one-off meeting and seek commitments from leaders of all countries on how they will reduce their emissions and stick to targets.  We need to keep climate change at the top of our political priorities and I am pleased to see that the Government has committed to introducing the legislation.  I hope we will see it become law in 2015.  It has long been promised.  I know there is support from all sides of the House for climate change legislation but the last Government could not get it through.  It is really important that we get it through in the term of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300004#C00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1411479300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In light of the unfolding controversy about the abortion guidelines published by the Department of Health last Friday as well as the HSE's report on Ms Y's case, made public by RTE's &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night, I have some questions for the Minister for Health.  As responsible law makers no doubt we all have questions for the Minister for Health.  It is imperative that we are provided with an opportunity to raise them with the Minister in the Seanad as soon as possible.  The people on all sides of the abortion debate deserve to have us, as public representatives and law makers, spend our time facing head-on whether our law-making is adequate, effective and whether it holds its intended impact, especially with a law as fresh as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.<br\/>On Friday last when he was commenting on the publication of abortion guidelines the Minister for Health was reported as saying:<blockquote>One thing I know as a doctor is that medicine is never black and white and I know as a legislator that legislation can never be black and white. It is never going to be possible to create guidelines that provide absolute clarity.<\/blockquote>My first question to the Minister is: Why not?  I have trawled through the guidelines and, although I am not a medic, I do not believe the issue is clarity.  With due respect to our Minister - it is great to hear such a straight talker - I do not believe it is a matter of clarity.  If the Leader would, please, invite him here as soon as possible the following are my questions.  The law we have made says clearly that a pregnant woman's assessment is on the basis of &quot;risk of loss of the woman's life by way of suicide&quot;.  Why do the guidelines state that what must be assessed is the risk to the woman's life arising from suicidal intent?  Suicidal intent, as a technical term, means someone must be planning an immediate act of self-harm.  While very clear, does this guideline not restrict the risk to a woman's life more than our law intends?  Another section of the guidelines, namely 6.4, states that an early delivery by induction or Caesarean section is permitted under the Act.  Why was this not part of the draft guidelines in July?  Why in legislation with the intent to make abortion legal when a woman's life is at risk do we now have guidelines for delivery?<\/p> <p>We cannot shirk our responsibility as law-makers.  Parliamentary debate on these issues should not be silenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300004#C00300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411479900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that No. 2 on the Order Paper, the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, will be taken this week.  It will seek to cover medical practitioners who have no insurance, and thereby protect patients.  I welcome this but it should be put on the record that this is, in essence, Senator Colm Burke's Bill.  His was an exceptionally good Bill from the Government's side of the House and there is no reason that the Government should not have accepted it at the time and, as I said then, amended it in the process if there were areas with which it disagreed.  For that reason I tabled a similar Bill, but I withdrew it when I heard the Government intended to introduce such legislation speedily.  However, credit should be given to this House and to Senator Colm Burke, who initiated this.<\/p><p>With regard to the question of abortion, I was taken aback by the provisions of the Government's legislation because they specifically excluded fatal foetal abnormality and rape.  During the hearings held in this House we were assured that suicidal intention, or to use that revoltingly unattractive phrase, &quot;suicidal ideation&quot;, was so rare as to be absolutely negligible, at only one in half a million or a million.  Next thing, one had landed on our plate, so it was necessary to consider it.  I note with satisfaction that recent opinion polls have shown that a majority of the Irish people, 56%, now strongly support allowing women to have an abortion in cases of rape or fatal foetal abnormality.  The Government should take note of what the voters are saying, not focus groups, conservative backbenchers and certainly not the so-called, self-styled Iona Institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300005#D00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411479900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Darragh O'Brien regarding the Inclusion Ireland report on speech and language therapy in this country.

Nobody in this House would stand over the appalling record with regard to dealing with young children at an extremely important and vulnerable age in their lives to ensure that they get the best start.  Indeed, I was even more troubled to discover that the situation in the Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary area is particularly concerning.  There are 18 speech and language therapists for the mid-west area and instead of dealing with a caseload of 50 each, which would be the appropriate number of cases to be dealt with by a speech and language therapist, they have an average of 203.  If one is meeting 203 people on an ongoing basis, one will barely remember them, let alone remember the detail of each specific case.  This situation is now at a crisis point.<\/p><p>I urge the Leader to arrange an urgent debate with the Minister for Health on the matter.  It might not be practical to invite the Minister to the House today, but it would be practical, and indeed necessary and imperative, that the Minister for Health would come to the House in early course to deal with it.  It is only when figures such as these are released and there is a realisation of the appalling situation people are in that action sometimes happens.  Various speech and language therapists will tell us about their specific caseloads and how difficult and challenging it is to deal with them, but it is only when the situation is chronicled on a national basis that one can see that children in Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary are not getting the same service as children in other areas.

Now, in an effort to impose its own candidate, it appears the Government has appointed someone to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, with the sole purpose of qualifying that person for election to this House via the cultural and educational panel.  It is time this House said \"Stop\" to the Government.  A referendum was held one year ago and at that time the public clamoured for reform.

I am extremely concerned by the emergence in the alternative health arena in Ireland of a highly dangerous so-called treatment for children with autism.  The offending products are called &quot;Miracle Mineral Solution&quot;, MMS, and &quot;chlorine dioxide CD protocol&quot;, which is a more dilute but nevertheless toxic form of MMS.  Proponents of MMS like to package it as a combination of sodium chlorite and citric acid mixed together to make chlorine dioxide.  Essentially, this is industrial-strength bleach.  The sale or supply of MMS as a medicine is banned in a number of countries including Ireland, the UK, the US and Canada.  However, despite the absence of any medical research to support its use as a medical intervention, it is still being marketed worldwide as a miraculous cure for serious diseases including AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, herpes, tuberculosis, cancer and Crohn's.<\/p> <p> MMS and CD protocol, although illegal, are currently being promoted and sold in Ireland as a treatment for autism.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is investigating a number of cases.  It is important to stress that autism is not a disease.  Rather, it is a neural developmental condition which affects social interaction and communication skills.  To put it simply, this is a hoax and scam.  A training seminar has been advertised in Kildare for November in order to promote \"doctors\" who will be able to give this treatment to children.  I have been in contact with the Minister for Health and thank him for getting back to me and I understand the HPRA and the Garda are monitoring the situation.<\/p><p>Parents must be warned of the dangers of this treatment.

The first was the Government's health policy, given the signal by the Minister that there seems to be some change in the Government's overall vision for health care and the practicalities of implementing Government policy on health care, and the second concerned water charges, given the confusion that still exists over the charges, how the system will work and the impact on families.  I respectfully ask the Leader whether he has been able to secure debates on any of these issues.  It would be very helpful for the House if he were able to do so before the budget, but as soon as possible.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on housing and homelessness.  We are all in agreement in this House that these comprise a very serious issue.  There is almost universal acceptance that we are in the midst of the most severe housing crisis in the history of the State.  There are 89,872 households, which represents over 100,000 men, women and children, on housing lists.  The waiting list has increased by 30% over the past five years.  There is a very serious problem with emergency accommodation and homelessness, not only in Dublin but also across the State.  There are 74,000 families in receipt of rent supplement.  Many of them are in private rented accommodation, not because they want to be but because there is no other option.  We just do not have social housing and we are not building any.  Therefore, whether people want it or like it or not, their housing needs are being met through the private rental sector.  Some &euro;350 million in taxpayers' money is being used annually to subsidise people in private rented accommodation.<\/p> <p>We need a debate on this issue.  The Simon Community published a report today which was sharply critical of Government policy and which said that the Simon Community's view was that there was no chance whatsoever of the Government meeting the target set by the Taoiseach of ending homelessness by 2016.  All the evidence points to us going in the opposite direction.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that issue because it is very important.  Housing is a fundamental right for citizens and we have an obligation to hold the Government to account on commitments it made in the programme for Government which in the view of many stakeholders are not being met.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300008#G00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411481400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I do not want to lose the opportunity to pay tribute to the Kerry minor and senior teams.  I can tell the House that they put a double smile on our faces in Kerry this weekend and on the faces of the thousands of people who turned out last night for the homecoming in Rathmore, Tralee and Killarney.  It was a great night and a joyous occasion for all the people.  I also want to pay tribute to the Irish Special Olympics team on its fantastic performance at the European Championship.  Amidst the crowd last night, there was a young girl who was sporting two medals - one gold and one silver.  She was the hero of the night as well.<\/p><p>I want to raise a problem that has arisen in the laboratory in Cork University Hospital with regard to blood testing.  Apparently, there is a glitch in the computer that is causing delays with blood tests.  People are coming not just from Cork but from Kerry and other counties for chemotherapy and surgery and they need to have these blood tests done before they can undergo their treatment.  This has been happening for over four weeks.  I know that the staff in the laboratory are working flat out and carrying out manual tests to ensure that people have their blood tests done but there is a backlog of blood to be tested and there will probably need to be re-tests because the existing blood is out of date and too old to be tested.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to give us an update on what is happening and when the problem will be rectified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300009#H00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1411481400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I second the amendment tabled by Senator Byrne.  I wish to highlight the fact that September is a month where we try to create awareness of childhood cancer.

I would like to think that we would all get behind the campaign by the Childhood Cancer Foundation in Ireland which is holding its own campaign for the second year.  This campaign is called Light It Up Gold and means that in excess of 60 buildings and other landmarks will be lit in gold to highlight that awareness of childhood cancer.<\/p><p>Over 200 children are diagnosed with cancer each year.  This means that four families each week receive the devastating news that a child has cancer.

We see improvements in other areas but we could have improvement in that area.  We also need proper and appropriate services for children who have been diagnosed with cancer.

Very often, they are the unsung heroes and heroines in this regard.  The work is ongoing all the time and it is only those people who receive the results of those services who fully understand how important they are and how important it is that there is someone there to speak for them as well.

The launch is being delayed for at least two years because wind energy is no longer competitive.  The report stated: &quot;The worldwide deregulation of the renewable energy project has caused the project to be postponed.&quot;  When Mainstream Renewable Power was set up, most countries paid a fixed price for renewable energy.  Since then, bar a few exceptions, including Ireland, the majority have adopted an open supply-and-demand model, which has slashed the return the company could generate from building wind farms.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources whether Ireland is out of step in using inflated yields to justify wind farms, and will he emphasise the concerns, mostly held by Senators on the Government benches, that the wind farm business is out of control and damaging the environment?  It may not make much economic sense, and the delay of the initial public offering of Mainstream Renewable Power for two years seems to indicate that.

We have all witnessed the fining of League of Ireland clubs lately, including Dundalk FC which was fined for the use of flares and the flying of flags when asked not to do so.

Obviously, it has been a great week for Kerry, with the dual win in both the minor and senior football championships.  There was also a hugely successful racing festival in Listowel.  I wish to refer in particular to the latter, because I have a bee in my bonnet about it.  Racegoers will know that festival meetings such as Galway, Listowel, Punchestown and Tramore are the backbone of Irish racing.  They make the biggest contribution to the revenue of Horse Racing Ireland and the general fiscal situation.  Each day in Listowel there were approximately 25,000 to 30,000 people in attendance.  On the very weekend that Listowel began, however, Horse Racing Ireland put on an extravaganza of high-quality classic racing at the Curragh and Leopardstown, with prize funds into the millions, attracting top-class stallion colts such as Australia.  I can assure the House that between them the crowds at Leopardstown and the Curragh would not compare to those that turned up at Listowel for the day of the Kerry National, which is only worth &euro;100,000.  Horse Racing Ireland therefore needs to get its act together, because this is a further downgrading of rural Ireland.  Listowel Race Week is a fixture, especially in the south-western counties.  Racegoers come there from all over the country.  Yet here is Horse Racing Ireland biting the hand that feeds it.  We receive a copy of the annual report every year showing where money is coming in on the tote, which is the revenue for horse racing.  It comes from the festival meetings, with ordinary horses owned by ordinary guys.  They are not expensive animals at all in the National Hunt sport that we all love so well.  Yet Horse Racing Ireland puts on these million-euro races the same day, which is absolutely crazy.<\/p><p>I wish to make another point, and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  There was a somewhat disquieting report in the newspapers last week about the days-off situation that obtains for garda&iacute; at certain levels.  My understanding is that garda&iacute; are obliged to work ten days running and then take four days off together.  It might be sensible in one way, but I understand it is causing serious problems, especially at senior level, where a Garda superintendent may be in hot pursuit on a particular crime.

I look forward to Senator Terry Leyden introducing legislation to provide for such protection.<br\/>There has been a welcoming of many triumphs and victories.  One very positive development for Irish sport and the economy has not been remarked upon thus far, that is, the decision last week of UEFA to hold some of the games in the 2020 European soccer finals in Dublin.  This will be very good for Irish soccer, the economy and Irish sport in general.<br\/>On the subject of soccer, the Leader has a great and long-term interest in the beautiful game.  I know that, through no fault of his own, the Cathaoirleach has not been able to facilitate me by allowing me to raise the matter on the Adjournment debate, but given that the Government, through the Minister, is investing funds in Irish soccer, we need to debate the future of the League of Ireland.  While we will welcome the holdiing of big European games at the Aviva stadium, unfortunately, league of Ireland clubs are existing on a pittance.  We are failing to provide adequate resources to develop League of Ireland soccer clubs to the full.  They may never be compared to the Premiership or <i>La Liga,  <\/i>but the soccer leagues in Scandinavian and other northern European countries are, in many cases, semi-professional and provide not just a sporting or an entertainment outlet but a strong economic outlet for many small towns and communities.  I welcome the advances made by the FAI and Mr. John Delaney, but where public money is made available to sports such as soccer - I have supported the allocation of this funding and would like to see more of it - we should try to plan a better future and provide for more firm foundations for the League of Ireland.  Clubs such as Cork and Dundalk are doing well, but some are expected to survive with an attendance at games of 500 to 600, which is not tenable.  I sought to raise the matter on the Adjournment, but owing to procedures the Cathaoirleach was not in a position to facilitate me.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the future of the long-established League of Ireland because such a debate might prove very useful.  It is a long time since 25,000 people watched Cork Hibs play Waterford, but we might try to get the league going again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300014#N00200","speaker":"1189"},{"type":"speech","time":1411482900,"counter":71,"content":"<p>As there does not seem to be anyone from County Donegal talking about what happened on Sunday, my late mother - God rest her - was from Ballyshannon; as such, I feel I am half-Donegal.

I am sorry to bring before the House today the very sad tale from San Francisco where a bunch of Irish students went on the rampage in a house they were renting over the summer period and completely destroyed it.  According to social media, it seems that up to 50 students stayed in this house at one stage.  The house was rented initially to a group of students, one of whom has been named on social media websites as a Trinity College student because an arrest warrant was left behind in the house which has been used to identify him.  The group of students had travelled to San Francisco under the J1 visa scheme but could not find the accommodation they had been assigned.  The lady in question is an immigrant from India who as a matter of kindness gave them the house.<\/p> <p>By way of thanks they smashed every door and window in the house.  They used a golf club to smash the walls and they left the place in a mess.  I commend the Irish community in San Francisco who have risen to this outrageous attack on the Irish reputation, not only in this country but among the Irish in San Francisco.  Many people in the construction industry in San Francisco have pledged to restore the house to its former glory for this lady.  Sadly, the story reached national prominence in the United States in recent days in that it was featured on CBS News, which went into the house and filmed the damage and destruction caused by these people.  I raise this today because it is a blight on the Irish reputation abroad.  I ask the college authorities, who are involved to some degree with the J1 visas, and the parents of these children to remember that when they go abroad they are wearing the green jersey-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300014#N00500","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411483500,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300015#O00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1411483500,"counter":76,"content":"<p>-----and that everything they do is being observed.

In that regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has attended the House to hear statements and Private Members' motions on numerous occasions.  Her commitment to this issue is, without doubt, there for all to see.  She has always expressed a willingness to come before the House, and I will ask her to come here and discuss this very serious issue again.<\/p><p>Senators van Turnhout, Mullins, D'Arcy and Moran referred to MMS, a debatable treatment for children with autism.  Senator van Turnhout suggested that it is a hoax treatment which puts the lives of children at risk.  I am delighted that she has raised the matter with the Minister for Health, and I support her comments. <\/p><p>Senator Coghlan and all Senators from Kerry supported its football teams and congratulated them on their wonderful victories.  Senator Mooney congratulated Donegal on its part in the finals.  Senator Coghlan also expressed the need to be vigilant where e-mails are concerned, especially those regarding the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to the graduate entry system for medicine and the cost of courses and loans, and called for an amendment to the Finance Act to allow the interest on such loans to be tax-deductible.  Other Senators also raised this issue.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins referred to mental health services.  As I said, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to come before the House as soon as possible.  <\/p><p>I replied to questions on water charges last week.  As I said, we discussed the Bill for days and everybody had an opportunity to speak at length.  In regard to housing and homelessness, I have asked the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to come before the House and he has indicated that will happen towards the third week in October.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; highlighted the childhood cancer campaign and commended it on its excellent work, and referred to the need for all of us to support the campaign.<\/p><p>Senator D'Arcy referred to petrol stretching and suggested that diesel laundering had not stopped in County Louth.  He highlighted the dumping of sludge over the weekend and called for the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to come before the House to give an update on the matter, something I will ask him to do. <\/p><p>Senators Barrett, Burke and others complimented the students of Kinsale Community School on their success at the World Science Fair in California.  It was an excellent achievement for the students, the school, their parents and the country.  We all commend them on their efforts.  Senator Barrett also highlighted the difficulties in the wind farm sector and called for the Minister of State, Deputy White, to come before the House for a debate on the matter.  I will ask him for such a debate.<\/p> <p> Senator Mary Moran, among others, mentioned the success of the Special Olympics athletes and Dundalk FC.  She also outlined her concerns about soccer hooliganism.  We would all like to be associated with the success of the Special Olympics athletes who did Ireland proud.<\/p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames mentioned the beef crisis.  As she knows, the demand for beef in European markets has never been lower, with consumption across the European Union having declined by 5% since 2010, largely connected with the economic climate.  In addition, Irish beef prices were at an historically high level last year when the average price was up 5% on the 2012 peak.  Obviously, therefore, prices were significantly higher.  As a consequence, the current drop in prices is being keenly felt by farmers.  While the Government is clearly restricted in what it can do in terms of becoming involved in the issue of commercial pricing, a number of actions have been taken to support farmers during this difficult period.  As the Senator may be aware, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40 million in 2014 aimed at sustaining critical mass in the suckler cow herd.  In that regard, there is &euro;23 million for the beef genomics scheme, &euro;10 million for the beef data programme, &euro;5 million for the beef technology adoption programme and &euro;2 million in residual payments under the suckler cow welfare scheme.  A number of other actions have been taken by the Minister who will keep the matter under constant review.  We should support him in the actions he has taken in this regard.  If necessary, further action will be taken.  <\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned medical graduates.  He also referred to the point made by Senator Feargal Quinn and supported the calls made for expenditure to be allowable against tax. <\/p><p>Senator Terry Brennan lauded the success of our sports people, especially the Special Olympics team.  On the sporting theme, Senator Ned O'Sullivan mentioned the Listowel races and rightly said holiday meetings were the backbone of the sport.  It was questionable to allow the prestigious meetings held at Leopardstown and the Curragh which clashed with the other fixtures.  It is a matter Horse Racing Ireland should examine in the future.<\/p><p>The Senator also mentioned the situation with holidays for garda&iacute;.  As the Cathaoirleach pointed out, that is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Bradford mentioned the fact that Ireland would host at least two or three games during the 2020 UEFA finals.  I compliment everybody involved, including the FAI, the Government, chambers of commerce and all those associated with the bid.  It was wonderful to win.  Eight cities were chosen and it is great that Ireland's capital city is among them.  <\/p><p>Senator Paul Bradford also called for a debate on the future of the League of Ireland and the provision of greater resources.  It is sad to see League of Ireland teams playing in front of 400 or 500 people.  There is a need to develop the game at local level.  As the Senator said, it will be a long time before we will see between 20,000 and 25,000 people attending League of Ireland games, as witnessed in the 1970s, in particular.  <\/p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned the Irish students in San Francisco and the bad image given to Ireland.  I understand the landlady mentioned - I heard it on the radio on my way to Dublin - that 14 students might have been involved.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has come out very strongly on the issue.<\/p> <p>These people must be held responsible.  They are doing dreadful damage to the image of Ireland in America, Australia and other areas.  They must be held accountable for their actions, and I hope, as the Senator said, that they are named and shamed, because they do nothing for the image of the country or their educational institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300016#P01900","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411484400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That a debate with the Minister for Health on the Government's plans to address the waiting list for services for children be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300018#R00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1411484400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I will withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300018#R00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1411484400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Senator Thomas Byrne has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to explain the circumstances surrounding the appointment to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art of a person who is a candidate in the current Seanad by-election be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300018#R00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1411484400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300018#R00450","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411484400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411484700,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The Seanad divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1411484700,"counter":106,"content":"<p>There is an equality of votes.

I noted that she was interviewed for the current edition of <i>The University Times<\/i>.  In the interview, she reminisces about her time in Trinity College and says she was there with people such as Brendan Kennelly, Eil&eacute;an N&iacute; Chuillean&aacute;in, Owen Sheehy Skeffington and Senator David Norris.  It is, therefore, a reunion this afternoon.  The Minister stated:<blockquote>... it was genuinely a very formative experience in terms of opening my eyes to a world that I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise, I think, have realised.  A world of ideas, a world of your right to question things and I think that really was a positive experience.<\/blockquote>At the end of the interview, she wondered whether we should &quot;ease off the academic pressure a little bit and give more time for students to talk about ideas.&quot;  The Minister is very welcome.<br\/>The amendments in my name support the Bill and are proposed in the spirit of being useful in bringing the Bill forward.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 11 are grouped together, which I welcome.  The issue is the wish of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, an eminent institution founded 230 years ago in 1784, to use the title &quot;university&quot; outside the country.  I appreciate that is its wish.  Certainly, its international educational standards support that.  It is the largest medical school in Ireland and has approximately 3,000 students, approximately 80% of whom are from outside the European Union.  The organisation has built up the reputation and status whose promotion is the object of this legislation.  In passing, one would wonder about the need of the institution to call itself a university for some purposes and not for others.  I looked up the top 17 universities in the world and noted approximately half do not use the title &quot;university&quot;.  An example is Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Oxford and Cambridge are primarily based on colleges.  There is also the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300021#W00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The Sorbonne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300021#W00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":119,"content":"<p>King's College London is ranked No. 16.

Can the Bill strengthen that?  Do we strengthen the Minister's hand in case people who are not as distinguished, qualified or eminent find loopholes in this Bill?  If somebody sets up the &quot;Trinity Economics University&quot;, it will be very difficult to prevent that damaging the high standing that Irish higher education has.  That is the spirit in promoting the intention behind this Bill and the reason I put down my amendments.  <\/p><p>Under amendment No. 1, &quot;education provider&quot; in the Bill is a person in the State who provides a programme of education and training.  The amendment we have put down states that, &quot; &quot;education provider&rdquo; means for the purposes of this legislation an educational institution in the State which provides a programme of education and training at levels 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the National Qualifications Framework;&quot;.  In other words, the work we are doing, the work the Minister is doing and the work her Department is doing warrant a stronger definition than the one in the Bill.

I support the general thrust of what he said - his general remarks about the Royal College of Surgeons and so on - but I think we will come on to that a bit later.  The definitions given under the interpretation section by the Government in this Bill are quite extraordinarily lax and flabby.  \"Education provider\" means a person in the State who provides a programme of education and training - a person, an individual.  That is daft.  This could include the couple who are entangled with the State at the moment because they are providing education at home for their children.  It is so broad that it covers everything.  This Bill is not dealing with persons, rather it is dealing with institutions, and so I think the institution should be included in the definition.  The provider is not a person.  The provider is an institution.  I urge the Minister to take this on board.<\/p><p>The Minister's amendment No. 11 begs the question of when a university is not a university.  Apparently, it depends on where one is standing when one is looking at it.  If one is standing on the Continent of Europe and looking at something, it is a university from Europe but yet it is not a university in Ireland.  That is mad as well.  I cannot really see why an education provider which is granted a university authorisation under this section cannot describe itself or cause itself to be described as a university other than outside the State or for a specified purpose.  This is not Doctor Who and the Tardis.  Can an institution suddenly become a university for a specified purpose?  I do not think so - certainly not a terribly reputable one.  I have difficulties with amendment No. 11 for those reasons but I strongly support Senator Barrett in his aim of tightening up the definitions in this legislation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300022#X00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I begin by welcoming the Minister to the House.  I think it is the first time she has been here for an education debate since her appointment and I wish her all the best in her work.  If the section relating to institutions marketing themselves as universities outside Ireland but not within the State is to remain, certainly the changes need to be made as suggested by Senator Barrett.  Like Senator Norris, I also have concerns about that aspect of the Bill.  I have serious reservations about it because the Bill sets a precedent in terms of radically changing the existing system we have of restricting for good reason and safeguarding the use of the title of \"university\".<\/p> <p>The reason we have such a strict system for protecting the title is to protect the reputation of our education system both at home and abroad and to make sure we do not end up in the same position as the UK a few years ago where any college could call itself a university.  I appreciate the legislation is clearly designed to address the concerns of one institution and it is restricted in that respect but I wonder whether this is the best approach to dealing with the issue.<\/p><p>While the Bill is not entitled the RCSI (amendment) Bill, it is designed to address the concerns of the RCSI, an institution which is not designated a university under section 4 of the Universities Act and which, because of section 52 of that Act, is restricted from using the title &quot;university&quot; within the State.  I have sympathy for the RCSI's position when it is marketing itself abroad.  Nobody could have a query about the high quality of the medical education provided by the college both to domestic and foreign students and the educational component of what they provide abroad.  While I have no concerns about the educational aspect of its training, it would be better if we were open and honest about the purpose of the legislation.  On the previous occasion it was taken in the House, I was away on business.  I had just left when I received a schedule which referred to the legislation.  The Bill had not been published and I had no idea what it was about but it was debated in the House three or four days later.  It is incredibly important legislation and the way it has been approached in the context of how it was introduced in the House has not been helpful.  It would have been better if it had been made clear from the beginning that it was designed to address a particular concern of the RCSI and we could have had a proper discussion on the best way to address that.<\/p><p>My main concern about permitting an institution to call itself a university abroad and not here is it looks duplicitous.  There is something fundamentally disingenuous about telling prospective students one thing abroad, enticing them here on that basis and then them finding out something else when they get here.  It is wrong and misguided.  I accept that the college has concerns.  Many of our institutions face difficulties when marketing themselves abroad because any two-bit institution in the UK can call itself a university and our finest institutes of technology, the RCSI and other institutions that provide top class education cannot.  Is this the best way of addressing that?  It might be better instead if we considered whether we should call the RCSI a medical university both at home and abroad and accept the fact it will never be a university because it does not provide the broad, interdisciplinary education one expects from one.  It would never, therefore, aspire as an institution to that title.  However, it provides top class medical education and, therefore, instead of selling a double message at home and abroad, which could be considered duplicitous, we should consider whether the RCSI should be called a medical university both at home and abroad.  That would be a better approach.  As part of that, any institution that wants to use the title &quot;university&quot; would have to have in place the governance structures expected of TCD, UCD and other universities.  Let us have one system that is fair and transparent.<\/p><p>I have serious concerns about what is proposed.  I accept there is an issue in the context of institutions marketing themselves abroad.  Perhaps a better way to address that would be to ramp up the activities of Education in Ireland.  In 2010, the previous Government set out a strategy, Investing in Global Relationships, Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010-2015.  Some of that remains aspirational.  Perhaps we need a greater emphasis on this and putting more resources into attracting international students here.  It in an area in which there is massive potential both in the context of revenue for our institutions in the short term but also in the context of longer-term benefits for the economy through having a network of well educated people across the world who were educated in Ireland and who have an affinity with the country to whom we can reach out when building other business, cultural and economic links into the future.  I would do anything to help our institutions to compete globally and attract students here but I caution that we need to do it in the right way and the hallmark of everything we do needs to be quality and consistency and making sure Irish education is seen as a leader globally.<\/p> <p>I wonder if the approach of allowing an institution to use one title abroad and another at home offers the best way to do it.  It is a little dodgy and not the best way of approaching the issue.  However, I am happy to work with the Minister in finding a better way to approach it and thus address the concerns of the institution concerned, as well as other institutions in terms of how they market themselves abroad.  I am sure the Dublin Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology encounter similar issues when competing with institutions that call themselves universities but do not provide an education anywhere near the standard provided here.  It is a big issue which we should perhaps address in a better way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300022#X00300","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411486500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>It raises the issue of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, which is close to university accreditation and a fine institution.

Senator Averil Power asked why one would use one description inside the State and another outside it.  It is specifically to address the issue of international education and the opportunities provided for the country.  There is wide engagement by universities and institutes of technology outside the State and Europe on the huge opportunities presented.  Also involved in that engagement, as pointed out by others, is the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which it is intended will benefit from this legislation.<\/p><p>I will try to address the issue relating to Waterford Institute of Technology.

It is an area of considerable reputational risk for Irish education as a whole and I urge the Minister, outside of this legislation, to focus her attention on it and consider the risk for Irish education because it is very serious.

To give some background information, in recent years the medical profession in Ireland has done a good job in persuading the rest of the country that we have reached an extraordinary level of international eminence in what we achieve in our medical schools.  We have extraordinarily gifted nurses and doctors who have done the country proud when they have gone abroad.  They have acted as unpaid reputational ambassadors for the quality of education they received.  However, one sometimes has to ask whether this has occurred in spite of, rather than because of, medical schools.  <br\/>I speak as a University Senator who represents an entity which has several medical schools.  I will provide the Minister with some arithmetic.  Ireland has a population of approximately 4.5 million people and six medical schools.  One can do the arithmetic - we have about one medical school per 700,000 people.  In the United States which has the most advanced academic medical structure in the world and the highest number of Nobel prizes, publications, citations, etc. there is one medical school per 2 million citizens approxiamtely.  In the United Kingdom there is one medical school per 2 million citizens approximately.  In Germany there is one medical school per 2 million citizens approximately.  If one adds some of the smaller countries in eastern Europe which have larger numbers, one will find that the rate is one medical school per 1.5 or 2 million citizens.  We are absolute outliers in any comparison.  One could say this must be a great country which places a huge emphasis on medical education and does not spend money on nuclear submarines or arms but on medical schools to educate young doctors.  However, we also have the lowest number of doctors per head of population and career level posts in any country in the OECD.  It will be apparent that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we structure medical schools.<br\/>I amused myself by going online - I probably broke procedure in so doing - and found that Harvard Medical School's affiliate campuses, that is, its hospitals, have a clinical faculty membership of 10,000.  To the best of my knowledge, the aggregate number of full-time clinical faculty members employed by the six Irish medical schools is less than 100.  Most of the work at clinical level is done by people who were primarily appointed by the health service and had varying degrees of enthusiasm and small amounts of time designated for educational purposes.  <br\/>When I say our bright young students graduate with a great medical education in spite of, rather than because of, the medical schools, I speak not with bitterness but with a cold, hard assessment of what we have.  I would fear for the future of medical education in Ireland in terms of reputation if we do not do something about this issue.  The world is full of countries which shall remain nameless in which there are degree mill medical schools in which people who have reached a certain degree of matriculation standard and with the financial wherewithal will find themselves in a medical school which will give them a degree which may or may not be recognised in different parts of the world.  <br\/>I would like to see substantial attention being paid not by the health system which is in a near-unfixable mess but by the education system to the structure of how we treat and train young doctors.  Do we have the right number of medical schools?  Do we have too many?  Is it appropriate to have so few full-time clinical faculty members smeared across such a large number of medical schools whereby we do not have full-time representatives in most medical schools in most of the major disciplines of medical specialisms? <\/p> <p>One has to ask what level of scrutiny this might attract and be able to withstand in the event that there are future international inspections of medical schools because what we have in Ireland is extraordinarily unusual.  There are downstream spin-off effects from it, one of which is that there is a complete lack of a leadership cadre of doctors in the country.  The overwhelming majority of hospital-based specialists work for themselves and the health service.  They do not have a boss and are not part of a unit within a cohesive structure.  They do not have hiring and firing authority.  Essentially, there is no senior specialist with any control over any specialist.  When I started off as a young consultant in New York, there were four recognisable layers above me, all of whom, with the right motivation, could have fired me if my performance was inadequate.  There is nothing like that here.  The net effect is that we do not have people in our profession who have a wide vision of how the health service should be reformed.  As a result, managers default into what should be leadership positions.<\/p><p>There are many good reasons for us to try to defend the reputation of our medical schools.  If they are to withstand scrutiny, it will require intense reform.  There is something seriously wrong in a country that has one medical school for a population of 720,000, three times the European average, which has so few doctors and in which there is almost no full-time clinical faculty.  We can debate all day which institutions should be called universities and those that should not, but if we are to fix the problem, we need somebody at a high level of authority to decide that this is something which is very important to our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300029#EE00200","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411488600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Some broad issues have been raised.

I do not care who is engaged in the marketing, except that the cost should be set at about the level of average pay in a university, not the multiples the people in question receive.  The adoption of capitalist terms in universities, within a few years of the capitalist system collapsing and having to be rescued, is bizarre.  I do not know what books on the economy my university colleagues read when they put forward this nonsense.  Mr. Brendan Kennelly's poetry did not deteriorate after 2008, but marketing, banking - perhaps due to too much banqueting - accountancy and management did.  That this failed lingo is being introduced into eminent universities is very sad.  That is the reason I am trying to take out the section.

Voluntary contributions are used extensively by schools to charge parents to plug the gaps left by cuts to their funding.  Some schools might charge &euro;50 per student while others charge hundreds of euro, effectively making the schools fee-paying.  We raised this matter during the previous Minister's tenure and he said no school could prevent a child from attending or participating in activities if this so-called voluntary charge had not been paid.  However, we know from speaking to parents that students are regularly excluded from activities or have lockers withheld from them where such a charge has not been paid, and the Department does not keep a record or monitor how much each school is charging parents; nor does it take anyone to task about these fees.  Some parents find it difficult enough to put children in school uniforms without having to deal with this charge as well.  I would prefer if this matter could be dealt with through specific legislation, but there has not been any interest in addressing it.  That is why I am availing of the opportunity provided by this miscellaneous provisions legislation to make these amendments.<br\/>Amendment No. 20 would further compel the Minister to report to the D&aacute;il on the practice of voluntary contributions with a view to gradually phasing them out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300031#GG01000","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1411489200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her contribution.

The Government approved in March the drafting of the education (admission to schools) Bill, and the general scheme has since been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  We will bring forward legislative proposals relating to school admissions and they will prohibit the charging of any fees or contributions as part of a school's admissions policy.  In addition, a parent and student charter will be introduced and this is probably a more appropriate context in which to address the issue the Senator has rightly raised.  While I do not propose to accept the amendments, I assure Senators that information for parents, including information relating to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue I will examine in the context of the charter and the proposed school admissions Bill.

While we have freedom of information legislation tabled for debate on Thursday, here we have a section entitled &ldquo;Refusal of access to certain information&rdquo;.  It is essential that, as with HIQA in the health field and consumer bodies in many other areas, people have information on issues such as non-performing teachers and people teaching mathematics who have no qualification in the subject.  These are vital decisions in the future of the country where we, as legislators, should act on behalf of young people in these schools who ought to know what is happening.<br\/>Why do we have such a section for such a vital decision when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin is introducing more freedom of information legislation this week and it is the ethos of our time to open places where information is closed and let people see what is happening and take better-informed decisions.  I oppose the section.  The opposition to league tables in education is wrong.  For example, we must have information on which 400 of the 4,000 schools in the country, are designated as Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools.  Why would we want people not to know what is happening in schools?  The section is very old-fashioned and goes against the spirit of modern education and the rights of children.  Every time we have tried to cover things up we have got into more trouble afterwards.  We should let all this information go out as part of reforming education on behalf of the next generation.  I was very surprised the Bill specified that we did not want information about schools being available to parents and pupils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300035#LL02400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1411491000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I strongly support Senator Barrett.

How is that for facilitating freedom of discussion?  On the other hand, the Government is clamping down on information which parents would value in terms of deciding where to send their children.  The question of performance of schools in terms of success in examinations, education or training facilities in respect of the academic achievement, the result or outcome of students and comparative overall results are things that inform parents&rsquo; decisions as to where to send their children.  It seems extraordinary that this would happen.

The Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, is Ireland's leading national institution for the collection and presentation of modern and contemporary art.  The museum presents a wide variety of art in a dynamic programme of exhibitions, which regularly includes bodies of work from its own extensive collection.  Its award-winning education and community programme increases awareness and understanding of the visual arts by creating innovative and inclusive opportunities for people to engage with the museum's exhibitions and programmes, both as audience members and participants.<br\/>IMMA is a major part of our cultural offering and, as such, is extremely important to the tourism industry.  Its beautiful setting in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, coupled with its diverse and innovative exhibition programme, enable it to attract very significant numbers of visitors each year.  <br\/>The year 2011 was the last time at which IMMA operated for the full 12-month period at the Royal Hospital site with visitor numbers of 363,000.  Following a &euro;4 million refurbishment programme, I see no reason the 2014 figures will not match, if not exceed, this number.<br\/>IMMA was established in 1991 as a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital.  The number of directors shall not exceed 15 and they shall hold office for a period of five years.  There is no remuneration payable to IMMA board members and on the record of this House I would like to thank them for their commitment and hard work on a <i>pro bono<\/i>basis.<br\/>Following a recent visit to the Irish Museum of Modern Art, as Minister, I took a decision to make two appointments to its board to allow for better regional representation on the board of such a significant institution with a national remit.  From time to time, my Department has invited, and will continue to invite, expressions of interest in vacancies on bodies under its aegis.  As Minister, I am not confined in making appointments to those who make expressions of interest.  It is open to me as Minister to make appointments outside of this invitation process once I am satisfied that the ultimate appointees have the relevant experience.<br\/>In considering potential IMMA board members, I was and am conscious of the balance of talent, experience and skills among existing board members, the skills need of an institution such as IMMA - one of our premier national cultural institutions, which also has a commercial dimension - as well as age, gender and regional balance.<br\/>Taking cognisance of all of the above, I appointed both Mr. John McNulty from Kilcar, County Donegal, and Ms Sheila O'Regan from Ardagh, County Limerick, to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art on 12 September last.  Mr. McNulty is a self-employed businessman who brings 15 years' business experience to the IMMA board.  He is involved in the local tourism and cultural committee in Kilcar and has a track record in promoting culture, heritage, the GAA and the Irish language.  He has been actively involved in local heritage events and heritage restoration projects in south Donegal, as well as festivals such as the Fleadh Ceol and is currently driving a three-year Irish language development plan for the area.<br\/>Ms O'Regan was the curator of the Palatine Museum in Rathkeale, County Limerick, for nine years.  She has an M.A. in local history from the University of Limerick.  She is a member of a number of local community and voluntary groups, and her previous experience includes time as a research librarian and a field survey representative with the ESRI.  She was a founder of the local community radio station, West Limerick 102FM, and is currently a producer and presenter for that station.  Her experience includes service on the boards of Rural Bus and West Limerick Resources.<br\/>I am satisfied that both Mr. McNulty and Ms O'Regan possess the appropriate balance of skills and expertise to effectively serve on the IMMA board.  I wish them every success in their tenure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300036#MM01300","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1411491600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I suppose that last word of the Minister's is probably the most unfortunate one of her presentation.

That was from the officials of this House.<\/p><p>This appointment was then used as grounds to run on the cultural and educational panel.  It is likely that this individual will get elected and the best of luck to him.  Presumably, however, his tenure - to which the Minister referred - will then come to an end.  That will show the disgraceful nature of the appointment.  <\/p><p>The other context for this debate and the Minister's actions concerns the referendum of last October when the people were promised reform.  They were promised that things would be done differently and that the old ways had gone.  Well, not only have the old ways not gone, but things are worse than ever.<\/p><p>Questions arise that the Minister must answer.  The Minister has not really answered the question about Mr. McNulty's qualifications for the job, although she has answered his qualifications for the Seanad.  On its website, IMMA states that members of its board are artists.  I do not know whether that applies to Mr. McNulty. <\/p> <p>Who gave the order for this job to be given?  Certainly, the talk doing the rounds of these Houses today is that there were instructions from the Government and the Fine Gael Party for this appointment to be made.  For the Minister to take instructions on an important role such as this would be a gross breach of her responsibility as a member of the Cabinet.  Was the job publicly advertised, or are the rumours that this person got the job without applying for it - that he got a phone call saying \"You can go on IMMA\" - true?  These things add up to one conclusion: that this appointment was part of an electoral ploy.  I do not know whether the Minister has looked at the Standards in Public Office Code of Conduct for Office Holders in respect of appointments to boards, but I have to say that my view is that she has skirted its requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300036#MM01900","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411492200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The Senator has 30 seconds left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300037#NN00150","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>That is a pity, because there are so many other things to talk about in respect of this.

I look forward to working well with her over the next while.  She knows my track record.  However, I wish to put a few points on the record.  I am not making a personal statement regarding the two appointees.  By the look of them they are two very qualified people, but I do not think they are qualified for the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  It is a contemporary art gallery and one that has an international reputation.  I am disappointed that near the start of her speech the Minister linked the appointments with tourism.  Initially, the Irish Museum of Modern Art was there to curate, exhibit, conserve and collect modern art for the 21st century for the citizens of this country.  Yes, tourism is important, but the primary aim of the Irish Museum of Modern Art is to engage with contemporary art and our citizens so that our citizens understand what extraordinary work both Irish and international artists are producing.  That is the pinpoint.<\/p><p>I understand this might be outdated, but the limit on the number of board members is nine.  By my calculation, adding two brings the number to 11.  I know a Government decision was made around two years ago whereby the cap on members was nine.  We are now at 11, so I would like confirmation as to whether there were vacancies or whether this broke with a particular Government decision regarding extending the numbers from nine to 11.  Second, did the Minister have a formal meeting with the chairman of the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the director regarding the skill sets required?  We know that the pressure on all arts organisations, including the Abbey Theatre, is with regard to fund-raising and philanthropy.  I want to know whether fund-raising or philanthropy was considered as part of the skill set when making these two appointments.  I want to know whether the Minister or her officials met with the board or the chairman in examining what skill sets might be required to enhance and support the growing reputation of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Those are the questions I would like to see answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300037#NN01200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister to the House on her first occasion here and congratulate her on her recent appointment.  I want to put two things on the record.  They include my own support for IMMA.  It does wonderful work and, as Senator Mac Conghail noted, has an international reputation in the area of contemporary art, which deserves to be protected and safeguarded.  The second thing I want to put on the record is my serious concern about the manner and timing of the recent board appointments, including the particular appointment we are discussing.  I am not making any personal comment about the appointee but I believe it creates an unfortunate perception and does not seem to be in keeping with the political reforms that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government have introduced.  I do not in any way wish to place the responsibility necessarily on the Minister, but I echo Senator Mac Conghail's questions about the numbers on the board and ensuring that there is an appropriate spread of expertise and skill sets on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300037#NN01300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I compliment both the Leader of the House and the Minister on so speedily acceding to the wishes of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in inviting the Minister to the House.  This was very gracious, and I exonerate the Minister.  It is fairly obvious that the orders came from the top.  The Minister is new and I wish her well in her Ministry, but I believe she had to do it.  The first part of her speech was carefully drafted euphoric waffle which has nothing to do with the issue.  She ended by saying: \"I see no reason why 2014 figures will not match if not exceed this number.\"  Well, they are not coming to see Mr. McNulty.  They are coming to see works of modern art.  It does not surprise me, coming from Fine Gael.  I remember how, many years ago in this Seanad, Deputy Shane Ross, who was then a Senator, persuaded me to sign a motion objecting to double-jobbing - people being in the Seanad and in the local councils.  I signed it.  Within three months, he was in Fine Gael and on the council and was raising the issue of local sewerage, so that is the way things go.<\/p><p>With regard to the argument that it has nothing to do with Mr. McNulty, of course it has everything to do with Mr. McNulty.  It is to do with his qualifications.  If one appoints somebody to a position, one wants to know what his or her qualifications are.  It was not clear from what the Minister said - I am not sure if she will have an opportunity to reply - whether Mr. McNulty actually applied.  I do not believe he did.  From everything I have heard today, it sounds to me as though he did not apply, so it is extraordinary that he got a job for which he did not even apply.  In respect of his business qualifications, I understand that he runs a petrol station, so I am not sure if they are going to take the Tesco route and open a petrol station in the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The last part of the Minister's speech referred to Ms O'Regan, who was not the subject of anything that was said here this morning.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to say that nothing could put in clearer context the Taoiseach's attitude to Seanad &Eacute;ireann than this utterly rigged and disgraceful election.  He is talking about expanding the university constituency to 850,000.  This is absolutely unheard of in a parliamentary election, yet he stands over and rigs an election with 250 voters or fewer.  I am very glad that my colleague and friend Senator Bacik uttered what I suppose was the strongest protest against this that she was capable of in her current position.  That shows that there are still a few standards left in the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300037#NN01400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her appointment.

I wish Mr. McNulty well in whatever position he is in, whether he finishes up here or not.  I do not know him and have never met the man.  It is not the norm for me to talk about people I do not know.  The genesis of this problem resides with the Taoiseach who has had a problem with the Seanad this entire term.  He totally misread the views of the Irish people about the Seanad when he hoisted the referendum upon them.  He did not come out too well out of the additional two appointees he put on the Seanad selection committee when Senator MacSharry, against all the odds, won a vote.  He added two Members just to copperfasten the majority which was a bit cavalier.  <\/p> <p>We are all politicians and we know how it works, but this one seems to be particularly crude, insofar as the Government promised a new type of politics which would be open, transparent and not all the things that bad Fianna F&aacute;il were involved with all the years back.  The reality is that this is a stroke of some sort.  I understand Mr. McNulty did not apply for or respond to the advertisement for the position, yet he was plucked from relative arts obscurity to be placed on the board of the museum.  It would appear he is also the candidate who will very shortly, in the absence of some enormous calamity, win a position in the Seanad.  His career in IMMA will be extremely short-lived.

It has also been brought to my attention that the VAT rate for ballet lessons is much lower.  I am looking for the recategorisation of Irish dancing at a low or non-existent VAT rate, given that set dancing and Irish dancing account for a significant portion of our tourism product.  People from all over the world come to this country in pursuit of set dancing and the elements that make up our culture.  In my local area, Ennistymon, there is a massive weekend of set dancing for charity in January.  It brings hundreds of people to the village.  From County Clare a set dancing magazine is distributed all over the world; it has a circulation of 10,000 and is issued every few weeks.  It is a significant product within our cultural offering and has mushroomed, but it could go much further if a more realistic VAT rate was applied.<\/p><p>An ongoing campaign run by people involved in the set dancing industry in County Clare is looking for a recalibration of the VAT rate in line with that charged on other dancing lessons such as ballet.  The case is reasonable and I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the Minister on the issue.  It is great that he is in the House to respond.  The people involved in the campaign will be pleased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300040#RR00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1411494000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I am pleased to take the opportunity to speak on the issue of the VAT rate applicable to Irish dancing lessons and dance lessons in general.<\/p><p>The EU VAT directive, with which Irish legislation must comply, provides that the supply of services and goods should be subject to the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 23%, unless specific provision is made in the EU VAT directive to allow a lower VAT rate to be applied.  As there is no such provision in respect of dance lessons, the standard VAT rate applies to Irish dancing lessons and most other dance lessons, since there is no provision in the EU VAT directive that permits a rate lower than the standard rate to apply.<\/p><p>Where an Irish dancing school is registered for VAT, it is entitled to a deduction for VAT incurred on goods and services used for the school.  For example, a VAT-registered school is entitled to deduct VAT on electricity, heating, decorating, etc.  <\/p><p>With regard to applying a VAT rate lower than the standard VAT rate to Irish dancing, the VAT directive does not allow a reduced VAT rate to apply to dance lessons, including Irish dance lessons.  Member states may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services set out in Annex III of the EU VAT directive which does not include dancing lessons.<\/p><p>With regard to applying the zero rate of VAT to Irish dancing lessons, this is also not possible according to EU VAT law.  Article 110 of the VAT directive provides that Ireland can maintain zero rating on those goods and services which were zero rated on and from 1 January 1991, but it cannot introduce any new item at the zero rate.  As Irish dancing was not zero rated in or from 1991, it is not possible to introduce a zero rate on dancing lessons now.<\/p><p>As with the application of a zero or reduced VAT rate, the EU VAT directive does not allow for the exemption from VAT of services, other than those specifically provided for in the directive.  The directive does not include provision for an exemption from VAT for the supply of Irish dance lessons or dance lessons in general.  If dance lessons were exempt from VAT, persons supplying dance lessons would not be entitled to deduct any VAT charged on their inputs.<\/p><p>The EU VAT directive provides that the supply of education to children and young people is exempt from VAT.  This is a public interest exemption which is designed to exempt from VAT the provision of education by schools and school education of a similar kind provided by other persons.<\/p> <p>VAT exemptions are by their nature narrowly interpreted, and such an interpretation would not allow Irish dancing schools to benefit from VAT exemptions under this heading.<\/p><p>In addition, while paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 1 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides for an exemption for cultural services provided by recognised cultural bodies, as Irish dance lessons are not provided by a recognised cultural body, they cannot qualify for this general exemption.  However, it is possible in some circumstances that VAT is not applied to Irish dancing lessons. This happens where a person supplies Irish dancing lessons and the value of these lessons is less than the VAT registration threshold of &euro;37,500 in a 12-month period.  In these circumstances the dancing teacher can remain unregistered for VAT and VAT is not applied to the dance lessons that he or she supplies.<\/p><p>Furthermore, where a person is undertaking Irish dance lessons specifically in order to become a dance teacher, this should constitute vocational training.  As vocational training is an exempt activity for VAT purposes, this means that where Irish dance lessons are provided for a student with a view to his or her becoming an Irish dancing teacher through a structured educational course, the dance teacher - that is, the supplier of the lessons - should exempt the lessons from VAT.<\/p><p>With regard to the VAT rate chargeable on admissions, Irish VAT law includes a VAT exemption for the promotion of, and admission to, live theatrical or musical performances where food or drink is not provided during the performances.  In this context, admission fees to Irish dance feiseanna should benefit from this VAT exemption.<\/p><p>In addition, with regard to the supply of Irish dancing costumes, these are subject to the zero rate of VAT where they are made for children.  Costumes and shoes supplied to adults, however, are liable to VAT at the 23% standard VAT rate.  VAT legislation contains details of which sizes are regarded for VAT purposes as children's sizes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092300040#RR00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411494300,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive response.

The Revenue Commissioners' leaflet on education sets out that, as a general rule, in order to qualify for the educational VAT exemption, a dance course must satisfy the criteria that it be provided in a classroom setting or a setting that is appropriate to the dance; it must be provided as a structured course with a clear syllabus, either by an individual or a group; it must confer a level of skill or ability which can be evaluated by comparison with the objective standards, generally external assessment; and a relationship must exist as between a student and a teacher or a tutor.  That is according to the Revenue Commissioners' leaflet on the particular courses that would be deemed educational courses and would therefore be exempt from VAT.
