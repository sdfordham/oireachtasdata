As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2016 voted allocations, I believe it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.  Specifically, this technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer &euro;20 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to bring forward expenditure commitments due in 2017 under the World Food Programme, WFP, and also transfer a further &euro;13.9 million of other savings to fund the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, which I announced in budget 2017 in October.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;33.9 million current funds required would be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the administrative budget pay and non-pay subheads, the fisheries fleet decommissioning scheme which is not yet in place, the seafood development programme, technical costs associated with the operation of European Union, EU, schemes, the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, training, research, the early retirement scheme and the food safety animal health and welfare programme.  <\/p> <p>  In 2015, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform lifted the moratorium on recruitment and delegated responsibility for managing my Department's human resources to the Secretary General.  This removed the numbers threshold my Department operated under during the moratorium and provided flexibility to recruit and deploy resources subject to adherence to specified pay ceilings.  My Department's management board continually assesses our critical business needs and our human resources division works closely with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to fill those needs.  <\/p> <p>  The recruitment process has been slower than we would have liked, due mainly to the significant pressure on the PAS system from across the public sector.  To date in 2016, my Department has recruited 110 new staff across a range of skills sets.  Our aim is to build the Department's resource levels to 3,200 by the end of 2017 with the right mix of skills, experience and competences to ensure we continue to deliver a high quality service.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;13.5 million in the 2016 payroll allocation.  A further &euro;1 million will be saved over various non-pay subheads under the administrative budget in the Department.<\/p> <p>  Our seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to our economy and I am aiming to achieve &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020.  A key driver of this increase will be the &euro;240 million European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, operational programme which was officially launched in January 2016.  Schemes under the programme will assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities. <\/p> <p>  I made some &euro;36 million available in 2016 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies to get the new schemes up and running.  However, there are some savings this year as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving in region of &euro;8.5 million on Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM's, 2016 current expenditure budget primarily because a proposed fleet decommissioning scheme did not start this year. <\/p> <p>  There will also be some &euro;1.5 million current savings on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department.  These savings identified this year will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF operational programme as these investments will occur over the later years of the programme.  To demonstrate my continued commitment to the EMFF operational programme, I have made available an increased budget of &euro;43 million, up from this year's amount of &euro;36 million, for the EMFF in 2017 across the budgets of my Department and its agencies. <\/p> <p>  It is also anticipated that savings of just over &euro;2.5 million will be achieved in the animal health and welfare area due to reduced instance of disease.  These savings are expected in the tuberculosis, TB, eradication area, where the generally positive situation in TB has been maintained.  However, I know difficulties continue in some areas and we cannot be complacent about the future.  Expenditure on the control of horses scheme is also lower this year than anticipated <\/p> <p>  There will be savings of some &euro;2.5 million under the agri-environmental scheme specifically in the training allocation under GLAS and some &euro;3 million will be saved under the subhead for market support and clearance of accounts which covers potential financing costs associated with the operation of common agricultural policy, CAP, schemes and also the costs associated with the land parcel identification scheme, LPIS, upgrade project.  Other savings are in the early retirement scheme and research grants where the drawdown of funding following awards made under the most recent research call has been slightly slower than expected.<\/p> <p>  Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to some &euro;33.914 million and these savings, with the committee's approval, will be transferred to the World Food Programme area.  The additional &euro;20 million provided for the WFP in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the WFP.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the WFP&rsquo;s executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will make a significant contribution that will enhance the WFP's capability to plan its interventions and better address the many growing humanitarian crises around the world.<\/p> <p>  My Department leads on Ireland's engagement with the UN's World Food Programme.  The WFP is the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions.  It is responsible for the delivery of food assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world and feeds 80 million of the most malnourished people in 80 countries.  It works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs. <\/p> <p>  The WFP also plays a significant role in the UN's global campaign for zero hunger, and is at the forefront of dealing with the migration crisis.  This contribution will help save lives and support food security and nutrition and rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings.  Ireland has a strategic partnership agreement with the WFP which doubles Ireland's core annual multilateral contribution to the WFP to &euro;20 million for the years 2016 to 2018.  This follows a commitment that Ireland made at last year's Expo Milan event to support WFP.  This funding, while generally targeted at the WFP's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on an un-earmarked basis which gives the WFP the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner.<\/p> <p>  While this increased commitment is provided on an un-earmarked basis for the reasons I have outlined, it represents a key element of the Government's enhanced and increased response to the ongoing refugee crisis associated with the conflict in Syria.  In particular, it is a significant part of Ireland's contribution to the EU's response to this refugee crisis.<\/p><p>This contribution enables life-saving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change and reaffirms Ireland's role as one of the World Food Programme's most engaged partners.  Ireland's multi-annual commitment facilitates effective assistance for hungry and malnourished people, particularly in regions devastated by war.<br\/><br\/>Some &euro;13 million of savings identified will be used for the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme that I announced on budget day.  In September this year, in response to market difficulties being experienced by milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors, the European Commission made a package of exceptional adjustment aid measures available to members under Regulation (EU) 2016\/1613, including an allocation to Ireland of just over &euro;11 million.  The &euro;13.9 million of the Vote savings identified will be used to provide additional funding for loans for livestock sectors and a parallel product to be made available under <i>de minimis<\/i>state aid to all other farmers, particularly those involved in tillage and horticulture.  This innovative scheme will primarily provide loans to enable farmers to pay down expensive forms of credit, such as merchant credit and other short-term credit facilities like overdrafts, improve management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of short-term borrowings.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, aims to make these loans available in the market by the end of January 2017.  The scheme, with total funding of &euro;150 million, will support highly-flexible loans for up to six years for amounts of up to &euro;150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%.  This rate will represent a significant saving for farmers when compared with other forms of unsecured short-term finance currently available.  The loans will be flexible, with interest-only facilities of up to three years.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply, although as the loans will be unsecured, it will facilitate a more straightforward application process.<br\/><br\/>I announced earlier this month that the SBCI had invited financial institutions to take part in the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme and a number of applications were submitted by the closing date of 25 November.  These will now be the subject of a formal approval process to be completed in the coming weeks, with the outcome to be announced at the start of the new year.  I encourage farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowing position now, and if appropriate to their circumstances to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<br\/><br\/>This is a technical Supplementary Estimate and the savings outlined will be used to fund both the World Food Programme and the SBCI agricultural cash flow support loan scheme.  I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#B00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is grand that there is spare money available.  I will make two points to the Minister.  \"Underspend\" would be the wrong word to use regarding the tuberculosis scheme, with  &euro;2.5 million saved as a result of the lower number of reactors.  I raised this matter recently with the Minister.  In the dairy sector in particular, a couple of depopulations have occurred.  By the time these farmers repopulate their herds, on foot of the changed environment in dairy markets, the price of replacement stock will be greatly increased in comparison with the price at the time of depopulation.  A herd may be fully depopulated at the end of October, when cows are at the end of the lactation year and a farmer must repopulate in March and April, when dairy cow prices are at a premium.  People in this position would probably see a differential of between 30% or 35% when it comes to repopulation.  This would amount to &euro;400 or &euro;500 per cow and when a herd has been fully depopulated, it would create financial hardship.<\/p> <p>  When a person's herd is fully depopulated and is out for a period of four to six months, for example, and there is a market discrepancy when animals are being bought, there should be some mechanism for compensating that farmer.  When the scheme was introduced, the principle was that if, for example, 120 cows were lost, the farmer would be able to replace them like for like when restrictions were lifted.  At the back end of this year, dairy cow prices were at a low ebb, valuations were done and farmers whose herds have been depopulated received a certain price.  I am not saying that the valuations were wrong but when the farmers involved seek to repopulate their herds in March, they will be seriously out of pocket.  As there is an underspend, could the issue of restocking farmers' herds be considered?  Could there be some equalisation in respect of the valuations received by these farmers?<\/p> <p>  We all know the hardship endured by grain farmers as a result of the 2016 harvest.  Before this meeting, I met a group of dairy farmers with a proposal seeking &euro;3 million in compensation for the hardship endured due to the loss of crops and straw.  To underline the scarcity of straw in this country, prices have doubled in the past month.  Farmers are worst hit only in December but by the time March comes around, straw will be as scarce as a hen's teeth.  We have spare money and although the World Food Programme project for which it is earmarked is worthy of investment, could some of those funds be diverted to these farmers?  As a result of the exceptional circumstances with the weather, they only salvaged part of their crops and lost all their straw.  They have suffered significant losses.  They are looking for &euro;3 million for 400 farmers, which works out at &euro;7,500 per farmer.  It would do something to ease their cash flow crisis.  We have the money so should we not look at allocating some of it in the way I am suggesting?  We have done it before for horticulture farmers and it was done when there was wind damage to forestry as well.  With the Russian export ban, the European Union put much money into eastern Europe.  The &euro;20 million is spare in the budget so could &euro;3 million be allocated to grain farmers.  It is not much when we consider the hardship they have suffered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#C00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It is clear that the position regarding grain farmers is one of great concern.  Not alone have farmers lost all their crops but the Minister knows that since approximately 2012, more than 100,000 acres has been lost from the grain sector.  That trend is likely to continue in view of what happened in the past year, with negative margins prevailing.  Everybody has lost &euro;150 to &euro;200 per hectare or even more if we add in the loss of straw, as described by Deputy Cahill.  As everyone lost straw, there will be much demand for the limited straw that is available, meaning the prices will increase.  Some farmers lost up to 50% of their yield and some individuals even lost more.  The farmers in the western seaboard counties of Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Donegal, Longford, Roscommon and Cork were affected.  In my county, approximately 14 or 15 farmers were fairly significantly impeded.<\/p> <p>  I know that these farmers are seeking a particular direct aid scheme and the Minister will probably look to work through the scheme he has devised for the SBCI.  The loans with rates of less than 3% applying would be a huge help when it comes to merchant credit and short-term financial facilities.  It is of some use but it is far down the line.  The applications for the cash flow support loan scheme must be evaluated and I hope the process will not be slow.  It should not be as there are only four or five applications.  I worry about the bureaucracy as people might not be happy with the i's being dotted and the t's crossed; they go back to rerun the show in a circular fashion.  This better be done by January.  The Minister gave some very eloquent presentations, which I acknowledge.  I know the mushroom industry will be covered by the SBCI scheme but it is a case of live horse, get grass.  The mushroom industry has been under pressure for the past three months.  Most mushroom farmers want to get over the hump now and know if they do, they will survive to be competitive in future.<\/p><p>Brexit will not last forever, notwithstanding that my original view was that it would take five years.  That might now be a conservative view, which highlights the uncertainty.  The Minister's proposal regarding the SBCI is a good idea.  Some of this money will create further capacity.  Am I correct that he will use it in that regard?  If it only took &euro;3 million to help grain farmers, they would be in big trouble otherwise.  I appeal to the Minister to do something with greater immediacy than what is planned with the SBCI income cash support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#C00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  With regard to Deputy Cahill's question about the TB compensation scheme, the savings will be &euro;1.5 million, not &euro;2.5 million.  Those savings are as a consequence of the fact that we made provision on the basis of trends and expectations and, fortunately, the incidence of the disease reduced from 3.25% of herds to 3.18%.  Though the number of herds is down, there was a slight increase in the overall number of TB reactors.  The provision made for drawdown has not been reached and that is something to celebrate.  The scheme is working well.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about individual farmers and the compensation scheme.  I understand his point and we have discussed it both formally and informally, but the problem is that the scheme was designed in consultation with the farming organisations and modifications to it only took place recently.  I cannot vary the terms of the scheme for an individual holding but I take the Deputy's point.  It depends on timing.  We face into a spring in which the indications are milk prices will increase and, as a consequence, the price of spring heifers dairy cows will increase.  I accept that will make it more costly for somebody who has been depopulated to re-enter the market.  The scheme was devised in consultation with the farming organisations but it comes up for review.  It is not written on tablets of stone but, unfortunately, the most recent modifications were only signed off in the early days of my tenure.  It will be up for review again and, by that stage, the individual whose circumstances the Deputy has raised will have moved on but my Department keeps the scheme under constant review and the issue will be raised in consultations with the farming organisations.<\/p><p>Both Deputies raised the issue of grain farmers.  I am acutely conscious of this because I have met them in my own constituency.  I have met farm organisations representatives also in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim and I understand the points they have made.  I concur with Deputy Penrose regarding the scarcity of straw.  There is little feed value in any straw as a consequence of the weather.  There was a perfect storm in many respects in the endeavours to get in the harvest.  When this issue was raging in the autumn, I undertook post-harvest to convene a stakeholders meeting.  All the relevant bodies were represented, including the farm organisations and the millers.  One of the interesting issues raised by the farmers and the merchants, in particular, was access to affordable finance.  One of the startling observations made by a miller was that 80% of spring barley is sold on merchant credit, which is one of the most expensive forms of credit that farmers use.  This issue was raised by every farm organisation in the context of the recent budget.  We faced a scenario where we had &euro;11.1 million in funding coming from Europe as a result of the July package, which was available for livestock both in the dairy and beef sectors.  We felt that if we spread that between 100,000 livestock farmers, it would make no meaningful or significant contribution to the difficulties they faced.<\/p><p>Given the common thread among all organisations, including those representing tillage farmers, was access to affordable finance, we examined how we could provide matching funds.  We put more than matching funds by providing &euro;14 million to extend the availability of the loan scheme not just to livestock farmers, but to the tillage sector as well.  The product with a &euro;150,000 maximum loan, low interest rate and other terms is not available anywhere else and that is well documented.  We extended the scheme under <i>de minimis<\/i>state aid rules to the tillage sector because there is a framework under which we are permitted to put assistance from the Exchequer into a particular sector.  We availed of the maximum liberty available to extend the scheme.  Where somebody avails of the maximum loan, that is the equivalent over three years of the &euro;15,000 threshold available under state aid rules.  That is not the solution for everybody who faces this difficulty but it will help some farmers in making decisions.  I appreciate time has moved on and most of them have made decisions to plan for winter barley or spring barley.  The scheme will make that more affordable.<\/p><p>There are other significant issues in the industry, not least the fact that 50% of the crop is grown on rented land, which is a major cost and which is questionable in the context of the viability of these enterprises.  Farmers are paying top dollar and that land is being chased by other enterprises, particularly grass and dairy farmers.  Individual farmers have to weigh up the affordability issue.  The grain sector is critical.  I would hate to see people exiting the sector in droves because the herd is expanding, particularly in the dairy sector, which will bring its own demand for ruminant feed.  However, the sector has to be based on a solid economic rationale.  One of the many issues is access to affordable finance and we have done something that is allowed under state aid rules.  I have extended the knowledge transfer programme, which was only available to the beef and dairy sectors previously, to the tillage sector.  I will announce in January the detail of the tillage TAMS.  I am open to keeping this issue under observation but limited resources are available and, equally, there is a legal framework which I cannot breach in respect of state aid rules.  I have exercised some of the discretion we have in that regard through the SBCI lending scheme.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy Penrose, Mr. Nick Ashmore attended a recent meeting of the Beef Forum where he confirmed that the January date for the scheme is still on target.  The call for partners, including the pillar banks which have responded, went out recently to roll out the scheme.  As the Deputy said, it will be made available to the mushroom sector.<\/p><p>This will help the mushroom sector, but Brexit produces very difficult circumstances.  Some businesses have gone to the wall already.  In the budget, we also increased the funding available under the capital grants scheme run by my Department for the mushroom sector and we fund the mushroom producer organisations.<\/p><p> I think that addresses some of the questions raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#D00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.  I apologise for the delay in my arrival.  I have a few points to raise.  I am conscious that I missed the Minister's opening statement, but regarding his identification of the &euro;33 million he is reallocating, the second largest reallocation seems to relate to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Proportionally, the amount involved is quite large in terms of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's budget, at 21%, and he is now proposing to reallocate it by means of the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask him to elaborate on the 21% reduction in the figure for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  A fleet decommissioning  that is due to take place has not yet started but it seems to form part of the figure.  Is that the entirety of it?  If not, what else is involved?<\/p> <p>  My colleagues raised with the Minister the issue of the tillage sector and the pressure under which it finds itself, but it is particularly important to re-emphasise this.  I have raised the matter in the D&aacute;il with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, at Question Time last week, the Minister indicated very definitively that there will be no crisis fund for the tillage farmers.  It is very much a minority of tillage farmers, but many among that minority have lost a significant proportion of their crop and are in a very difficult financial position as a result, particularly on the back of the past three years when the sector was not profitable.  This is a real issue.  The Minister indicated that those affected will be eligible for the SBCI loan fund.  However, this simply does not meet the needs of that identified minority of tillage farmers.  The Minister and the Government need to reconsider this matter and find funding which can be used to support those who are in dire need and experiencing cash flow pressures.  The committee will meet representatives of the tillage sector later but this issue is of the utmost importance now.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the updated Estimates published last week, at that stage the Department was &euro;222 million behind profile for the year.  A significant proportion, &euro;177 million, of that was recurrent and &euro;45 million was capital.  A significant part of this seems to be due to the fact that GLAS payments have not been processed.  Can the Minister elaborate on this?

If so, what will be the amount involved?  As already indicated, last week the amount stood at &euro;222 million.  What does the Minister project the figure might be at this point?

Regarding his persistent line of prosecution that we are underspending on the rural development programme, the reality is that we are behind profile on it.  As a result of the fact that GLAS payments are made in December, we will have our spending under GLAS on target by the end of the month.  All those awaiting GLAS payments know that they are issued in December.<\/p><p>Regarding the crisis fund, I appreciate the points the Deputy raises in respect of the tillage sector.  As I said earlier, I met the chairman of Donegal IFA while on a visit to the county and I understand the issues raised.  However, even if I had an open amount of resources, I am legally constrained by state-aid rules in the context of what I can do.  Given that access to affordable finance was a common thread in the views expressed at the stakeholders' forum and in all the pre-budget submissions we received from farmers' organisations and others, we thought it a reasonable proposition to use the <i>de minimis<\/i>provision that exists under state-aid rules to leverage the &euro;150 million loan fund at much more affordable interest rates than previously.  We have used the latitude we have under state-aid rules, that is, the <i>de minimis<\/i>provision.  If somebody draws down the maximum SBCI loan over a three-year period - I appreciate that not everybody will do so - he or she will avail of the maximum <i>de minimis<\/i>provisions available from the EU.<\/p><p>Deputy McConalogue also made the point that the &euro;7.5 million relating to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, seems to be the largest savings figure.  He referenced the decommissioning scheme.  The &euro;7.5 million is significant to BIM and does relate to decommissioning.  There is a saving of approximately &euro;500,000 in pay in BIM.  Overall, however, the largest headline saving in my Department, interestingly, is on the administrative side, at &euro;13.5 million, on the basis of intended recruitment of additional staff because of the embargo for several years and voluntary redundancies on top of that.  We have a number of emerging gaps in the skill set required in the Department.  Due to the fact that - within a controlled framework - some latitude was granted to State agencies and Departments to hire additional staff last year, the Public Appointments Service was busier than usual.  Therefore, anticipated recruitment of additional staff in 2016 did not take place and there is a saving of about &euro;13.5 million as a result.<\/p><p>Regarding the SBCI and the purpose of the &euro;25 million, which consists of &euro;14 million in Exchequer and &euro;11 million in EU funding, it has gone into leveraging the fund.  There is approximately &euro;100 million in European investment funding and in the region of &euro;50 million in SBCI funding.<\/p><p>The sum of &euro;25 million is in the context of a subsidy to the interest rate that farmers will pay and a guarantee against first losses.  The provision makes the fund more affordable for anyone who avails of it.  The purpose of the &euro;25 million is to make sure that the product is more affordable.<\/p><p> The reason for the scheme is evident when one considers the Q1 Central Bank report of 2016 as it made reference to the cost of finance in Ireland relative to other EU member states.  The report clearly shows that other countries had access to more affordable finance.  If I recall the detail correctly, Austria led the way with products available at 2.2% and Ireland had a significantly higher rate.  The provision of &euro;25 million does something to address the matter.  I hope, as a consequence, it will force more competition in the market not just from the pillar banks but from other players to make finance more affordable for farmers.  <\/p><p> Recently Deputy Cahill and I attended a meeting in Limerick with the ICMSA.  On that occasion a farmer said that the KBC Bank was offering a product at the same interest rate.  I do not know whether he or she compared similar products.  If it is the case then the step is welcome.  <\/p><p> I ask the Chairman to repeat his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#E00600","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>What does the 3% reduction in the research and training fund entail?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#F00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>My understanding is that it is something we anticipate will be spent in 2017.

I ask the Minister to clarify whether there will be an underspend in his Department's projections come 31 December in terms of budget 2016.  We have debated the rural development programme a number of times, particularly the overall envelope for the seven year cap for GLAS.<\/p><p>I wish to specifically refer to the Department's 2016 budget.  The Minister has stated that the current underspend will be reallocated into the Supplementary Estimate.  Aside from that.  Does he expect all funds to be spent by the end of 2016?  Do the Department's figures show an underspend at this point? <\/p><p>In respect of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, funding and the &euro;24 million that Europe and this Supplementary Estimate is putting towards the &euro;150 million loan fund, the Minister has indicated that the &euro;24 million of EU and domestic funding will go towards two aspects.  First, interest rate amelioration or funding part of the reduced interest rate that farmers can avail of and, second, the funding will ensure against first loss.  I ask the Minister to flesh out how these initiatives will work.  What proportion of the &euro;24 million has been dedicated towards reducing the interest rate?  Will the banks receive payment from the &euro;24 million to provide a lower interest rate?  I ask the Minister to explain the matter and the insurance part.<\/p><p>I have another question on the &euro;24 million.  Once the loan fund is finished and runs its course - and if there are no significant losses to be borne by the State or banks do not have to be recompensed due to no guarantee being required from individual lenders to the banks, if there are not sufficient losses to be covered - will a good proportion of the &euro;24 million be returned to the State for further use?  If so, will it fund further financial instruments afterwards?  <\/p><p>I support the point made by Deputy Cahill about the <i>de minimis<\/i>rule.  The Minister has given the impression that tillage farmers and farming organisations did not ask for credit or a crisis fund.  He took the main theme to be that they wanted loans.  I got a different reaction from the farming organisations.  I remember that they asked for a crisis fund when the crisis took hold.  The farming organisations quite clearly called for a crisis fund.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  <\/p><p>As much as &euro;20 million of the Supplementary Estimate will go towards the UN World Food Programme that is not due until next year.  Does that mean that the &euro;20 million the Minister planned to spend on WFP next year will be available in the 2017 budget for other purposes?  Is the money in addition to what will be spent next year?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#F00800","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions and I shall first respond to Deputy Cahill.  We are not talking about savings in the Teagasc budget in terms of the Supplementary Estimate.  The savings on the research side do not have anything to do with Teagasc.  They are calls that the Department makes for funding it has available for various research projects.  Once it makes an allocation or contract to the successful bidder for the funding the drawdown is then in the hands of the successful applicant, subject to certain terms and conditions.  As I have identified here, the successful applicants have not triggered the drawdown yet but the allocations have been made.  The funding has been made available under what is known as the Food Institutional Research Measure, FIRM, and the Research Stimulus Fund, RSF, allocations.

It could not have anticipated it.  In 2015 there were big yields but low margins in the tillage sector.  That covered a multitude.  However, there has been a total collapse in 2016, particularly on the western seaboard, from Deputy Charlie McConalogue's county down.  It has even stretched to County Longford and across the midlands.  Surely it is not beyond the Department to make a particular case to the European Commission.  The case that needs to be made is that this problem requires an input and the Commission should play a role in that regard.  The impact of weather events on our potential means that they rank among the extraordinary <i>force majeure<\/i>events.  If farmers in the sector have lost on average &euro;25,000 per annum, or &euro;100,000 in the past four years or so, where is this going to go?  Will there be a grain sector?  This will have huge knock-on effects on other areas also.  I refer not only to the cattle, beef, sheep and milk industries but also to those involved in malting, etc.  Can we not claim exceptional circumstances in this context?  I understand the Minister's point about working capital.  Certainly, a rate of 2.95% is an awful lot better than what has been available.  It is a little over one third of what was being charged by some of the commercial banks for a while.  We had better be careful to acknowledge that it is helpful.  Can the Minister not stretch it?  I made a similar suggestion when I was looking for something different for the mushroom industry.  Like Deputy Charlie McConalogue, I understood the farming organisations were looking for a particular crisis fund of up to &euro;15,000 per farmer that could be distributed.  Perhaps I was wrong in that understanding.  Perhaps they have two ways of submitting things.  I might have been wrong in how I interpreted the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2016120600002#G01200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481036400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>When I received submissions from farm organisations in advance of the budget, they asked for an affordable finance product.

Second, I am legally constrained by the <i>de minimis<\/i>rules in the aid I can provide.  Although the tillage sector is important in the context of our agricultural activity, we are a relatively small player at EU level.  There has not been a clamour from the major grain growing states, particularly France, Poland, Hungary and Romania, for a rescue package.  If that happens, we will certainly hitch our wagon to that momentum.  There is no evidence, however, that a realistic campaign by the major grain growing countries for a compensation package is under way.

It is an honour to have been invited to appear before this committee.  I consider this an ideal moment to be here because, as members know, a few weeks ago on 16 November the Commission adopted the autumn package that launches the economic policy co-ordination cycle for 2017.  In addition, only a few days previous to that, on 9 November, the Commission released the autumn forecast.  It is, therefore, a good occasion to discuss issues related with the main policy messages of the Commission to the EU and the euro area, as aggregate entities, and especially for Ireland.  I have learned that the recent reform of the budgetary process in Ireland gives the Parliament a more prominent role in the formation and scrutiny of budgetary proposals.  This is an important development which will enhance transparency and ownership of the fiscal framework in Ireland.  It also gives more sense to my presence before the committee to discuss a broad range of issues linked to economic policies in the euro area and Ireland, including budgetary policies.<\/p> <p>  I will start by briefly introducing the autumn package where the Commission presents, every year, the economic and social priorities for the European Union in the year ahead.  The package starts the 2017 cycle of economic governance, the European semester, and assesses the euro area member states' draft budgetary plans for 2017.  The package builds on the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast that was released on 9 November.  The core document, where the Commission's sets those priorities, is the annual growth survey.  This year, the Commission calls on member states to redouble their efforts along the virtuous triangle of economic policy; re-launching investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.<\/p><p>Emphasis is placed on the need to stimulate more inclusive growth and to strengthen competitiveness, innovation and productivity.<\/p><p> The annual growth survey signals that Europe is experiencing a fragile but relatively resilient and job-intensive recovery.  Its GDP is now higher than before the crisis.  Unemployment is decreasing and investment is growing again.  However, there is no room for complacency.  Some of the tailwinds that have supported the recovery so far are fading.  The legacies of the crisis, notably the social impact, through high unemployment as well as high levels of public and private debt, and the share of non-performing loans, are still far reaching.<\/p><p> Similar to last year, the policy guidance in the annual growth survey is accompanied by the recommendations on economic policy of the euro area, which are also part of the autumn package.  The fiscal part of the recommendations reflect the main conclusions of a new communication on the euro area's fiscal stance.<\/p><p> I wish to say a few words on the communication.  The communication starts by recognising that, albeit resilient, the economic recovery is weak and inflation remains well below the 2% target.  In that context, the Commission is calling for a moderately expansionary fiscal stance for the euro area.  It is what the document calls a positive fiscal stance.  The positive fiscal stance refers to both the supportive, that is, expansionary, direction that fiscal policy should take overall and to the quality - I put the emphasis on that - of the composition of the adjustment in terms of repartition of efforts across countries and of the types of expenditure or tax cuts, or both, behind it.  The findings of this communication are reflected in the fiscal aspects of the recommendations on the economic policy of the euro area that also refer to productivity, labour markets, banking union and they also depend on economic and monetary union.<\/p><p> Another document which is part of the package is the alert mechanism report, AMR, which is also an integral tool of the European semester, which aims to prevent or address macroeconomic imbalances.  The goal is to promote the smooth functioning of the economies of the member states and to prompt the right policy responses within the so-called macroeconomic imbalances procedure.  Based on the analysis in the AMR, the Commission has concluded that in this European semester cycle, 13 countries, including Ireland, will be covered by an in-depth review because imbalances were identified in the analysis presented in the report on the basis of the agreed scoreboard.<\/p><p> In the previous European semester cycle, imbalances were identified for Ireland in the financial sector, private and public sector debt, and high external liabilities.  The current alert mechanism report highlights similar issues.  Therefore, the Commission considers it would be useful to examine further the persistence of imbalances or their unwinding.  The Commission will present the conclusions of the in-depth reviews as part of its annual country reports in early 2017.<\/p><p> The analysis and opinion contained in the autumn package are based on the main findings of the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast.  I would summarise the main messages for Ireland as following.  Irish GDP growth surged in 2015, mainly driven by the operations of some multinationals, with little impact on the domestic economy, but underlying economic activity also grew strongly by 4% to 5%.  Domestic demand is projected to expand at robust rates, although risks have increased, also due to the UK referendum.  Employment growth and the continued recovery of wages are forecast to support private consumption over the forecast horizon.  The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 7.6 % in 2018, thanks to continued job creation and despite sizeable population growth.  The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is forecast to be negative this year but to recover in line with global trade over the forecast horizon.  The structural deficit is expected to remain broadly stable in 2016 and to improve gradually by 2018.  The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to 71.9 % in 2018, contingent on robust GDP growth and primary budget surpluses of more than 1.5 % of GDP per year in 2016 and 2017.<\/p><p> If I can have another minute, I wish to say a few words on the Commission's opinion on the draft budgetary plan of Ireland, which is currently under the preventative arm and subject to the transitional debt rule.  The Commission has concluded that the budgetary plans for Ireland are broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP.<\/p><p> It should be borne in mind that the Commission recalls that the Government's decision to use a large part of volatile, and therefore still uncertain, corporate tax intakes to allocate additional expenditure in 2016 is not in line with Council recommendations of July, in the context of the European semester, which ask Ireland to use windfall gains from better than expected economic and financial conditions to accelerate the deficit and debt reduction.<\/p><p> After putting on the table this large variety of issues in terms of Ireland and the EU, I will stop here and am ready for a fruitful discussion.  I thank the committee for its invitation and for the attention of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481043600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.  I welcome the delegation from the Commission.  However, I find a contradiction at the heart of the presentation.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke of the need to have a moderately expansionary fiscal stance and he said the Commission wants this to happen, yet when we introduced a budget that is expansionary, it was criticised because we did not put the gains we have made into debt reduction.  We were not allowed to have any fiscal expansion.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke about the social impact of the crisis and many of the expenditure aspects of the budget are directed towards addressing that impact.  The Commission invited the authorities to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the SGP.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay also spoke about the high level of debt, yet he ignored the role the Commission had as a member of the troika in setting that debt by not giving us any leeway around bondholders and bank debt in particular.  Our hands were tied in terms of expansionary fiscal measures that the Commission otherwise called for.  Could he address the contradiction?<\/p> <p>  The presentation made by Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is very like the budget presented by the Government in that it is a Brexit-free zone.<\/p><p>He spoke about positive tail winds, but the decision by Britain to exit the European Union is a gale on our doorstep.  What impact does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay believe this will have in 2017 and what short-term impact does he believe it will have on our figures?  Is the Commission willing to assist us in dealing with this impact, given that we are the only country on the front line of this major happening?<\/p><p> In September, the President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker, spoke about the need for capital expansion and the need to be flexible about the rules on capital expenditure.  We have major capital deficits in this country, which will be addressed during a capital review in 2017.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay put meat on the President's proposals on relaxing the rules for capital expenditure in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#C00200","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481043600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his questions.  I will try to address the so-called contradiction.  I remind the Deputy the Commission communication refers to the fiscal policy stance in the euro area.  The Commission began by analysing the economic cycle in the euro area.  It sees aggregate growth in the euro area as resilient but still low.  It also sees that inflation clearly remains below 2% and that monetary policy in the euro area has already reached the zero lower bound.  Nominal interest rates are zero, which means there is not much room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, the Commission sees aggregate domestic demand in the euro area as still weak.  On this basis, the Commission considers the fiscal policy stance in the euro area should be positive, which means in those member states with room for expansion in fiscal policy it should be expansionary and positive.  In considering the fiscal policy stance of other member states, the Commission also considers the composition of the adjustment, which is the distribution of the adjustment in various countries, so that countries with fiscal policy space which have reached the medium-term objective and have low levels of debt have room to extend fiscal policy, but countries which have not yet achieved the medium-term objective and have high levels of debt, and countries still in excessive deficit, should be broadly compliant.  This is the case for Ireland.  Countries in the corrective arm should continue to consolidate.  Where the level of deficit in public finances remains unaffected, the Commission advocates for less extortionate taxes, broadening tax bases and increasing the relative weight of investment.  This is what the Commission communication states.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ireland, the Commission considers Ireland's budgetary plans are broadly compliant.  There are some risks, as the expenditure benchmark may not be fully in line with our recommendations, but Ireland is broadly compliant.  We must take into account the growth rates for Ireland and the euro area are very different.  For Ireland, we project growth at 3.6% a year and 3.5% the year after.  For the euro area, the projection is still 1.5%.  With regard to the cyclical position of the country, without entering into a discussion on calculating the output gap, there is consensus the output gap for Ireland is already positive.  This means there are risks in principle of over hitting it, which means Ireland does not need to put in place expansionary fiscal policies.  In my view, there is no contradiction because we state what the fiscal policy stance of the euro area should be, but we also differentiate between the respective cyclical positions of countries.  In this sense, I would not say there are contradictions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to flexibility, the Commission published a communication in January 2015, and the Council adopted a commonly agreed position on flexibility and clarified the rules under which there could be some flexibility in investment which is equivalent to structural reform.  We use the structural reform clause of the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for temporary deviations from the adjustments to the medium-term objective to invest more or enhance investment.  The Council stated this clause would apply only to countries with negative growth or a very large negative output gap.  These are the conditions and the Council allows for some deviation.  I can go through the details if the committee wishes, but I would not like to cover all of the issues in this reply.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what we predict for next year, the entire euro area has been affected by the tail winds.  Of course next year the tail winds may disappear, and therefore we must prepare our economies to be more resilient and ready to adjust to the new conditions.  We can deal with other issues later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1481043600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I asked specifically about the impact of Brexit on our fiscal plans.

All we know is there was a referendum in which the people of the UK voted to leave the EU.  We also know that after the referendum there was a serious depreciation of the pound.  There was also quite a strong initial temporary impact on the stock markets but they recovered.<\/p><p>The only stocks on which this had a more permanent impact were those in the banking sector, and that was not only in this country but also in the UK.  It impacted on almost every type of bank almost everywhere in Italy because it was a factor from the beginning of the year.  Apart from that, the stock markets have recovered completely and the impact on risk premium, in particular for this country, was almost non-existent.  What has remained after the referendum is a weaker pound.<\/p><p> Brexit is another process.  We do not know the structure of the relationships that will exist between the UK and the EU after Britain exits the negotiations because the negotiations have not started.  There are no negotiating positions until Article 50 is activated, which lies only in the hands of the UK Government or authorities.  I do not know if that is something that has to be decided internally in the context of the UK authorities.  It is up to the UK to activate Article 50, and until it is activated, the UK is an EU member state and nothing changes except that we know now that the pound is weaker.  We know that perhaps there will be some impact in terms of confidence in the currency, which will affect mainly investment in the UK, but we have incorporated that in forecasts concerning  the UK.  There are some issues linked mainly to the weaker pound that could favour exports from the UK to the rest of the euro area and make exports from the euro area to the UK more expensive.  Such effects are not yet visible but we have incorporated them in the autumn forecast.  I would like to make clear that we have not incorporated any impact of Brexit simply because we do not know when the Article 50 will be activated.  We do not know how long the negotiations will last.  We know they will have to conclude within two years at most following the activation of Article 50.  We do not know what the structure of the relationships between the UK and the rest of the EU will be after Brexit.

There has been an investment drought here both in the private and public sector for the past decade.  Our capital investment has gone from about &euro;10 billion down to &euro;4 billion.  There are serious cracks now starting to appear.  They are going to become more and more obvious and visible.

No economist would suggest Ireland's economy is overheating based on an unemployment rate of 8%.<\/p> <p>  Accordingly, we found ourselves heavily penalised because the accuracy of a rule which no one would defend was applied to Ireland.  Does the Commission have a view on that?  When we put it to the Irish authorities, the answer was that is the rule and we have to use the ten-year rolling average unemployment and, as such, we are deemed to be overheating.  Accordingly, we are deemed to have missed our target and the fiscal space has been contracted significantly by applying the convergence margin.  When the rules, to which we have signed up, are not lined up with reality, should the Commission still insist on applying them?<\/p><p>The Commission should still insist on applying them.<\/p><p> I will ask my questions one at a time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#H01000","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481043600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#J00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481043600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>There are several questions here as I see it.  One concerns the way in which we calculate the output graph and potential output.  This is based on a commonly agreed methodology.  There is a technical group within the EFC which is chaired by Mr. McCarthy, an Irish official.  We apply the same methodology to all of the countries in order to have an analysis of the cyclical positions which is comparable across all countries.  We use the production method and we have a way to calculate the multifactoral productivity and capital stock.  This is very complex, technically speaking but at the same time, the methodology is very transparent.  All countries can see exactly how the calculations are made.  This is the way we measure the cyclical position of the different countries.  In the case of Ireland in particular the calculations were made on the basis of the budgetary plans one year ago.  At that time, we did not know about the revision that took place concerning 2015 and the various adjustments that had to be made.  Last year we saw the output gap closing very quickly.  This year we still have very high output gaps.  In some cases, the output gaps are positive.  In the case of Ireland, the output gap will start to close in 2018 or later.<\/p> <p>  This methodology also allows us to calculate the structural balances, that is, the parts of developments in the balance which are not due to the cyclical evolutions, that is, due to the fact that if one grows faster, one has more taxes, less unemployment and therefore, less expenditure.  These cyclical fluctuations or impacts on the budget are netted out from our calculations of the structural balance which are made on the basis, in turn, of our calculations of the output gap and potential GDP.<\/p> <p>  This is one indicator that we use in order to determine to what extent the fiscal stance in the country is appropriate, taking into account the debt levels and the distance towards the medium-term objective, MTO.  We have used another indicator which is the expenditure benchmark.  This is related to the ten year average of potential growth.  We never use these two indicators in a totally mechanical way.  We make what we call a nominal assessment in order to understand better the underlying factors concerning the changes in the structural balance and the structural expenditure.  That is, the expenditures net of discretionary tax changes.  We never use this in an automatic or mechanical way.  We always look at all of these factors.  We examine the cyclical position of the economy, the distance with respect to what we have defined as the MTO which ensures that there is enough room in front of cyclical fluctuations.  We also look at expenditures net of expenditure finance through EU funds and net of cyclical expenditures, for instance, of unemployment and net of interest payments and discretionary changes in tax revenues and how these have evolved compared to potential growth - not potential growth for one year but over a number of years.  <\/p> <p>  Finally, this is why our assessments may change although we have to take into account that the benchmarks are frozen either in 2015 or 2016.  We even reduce the possibility of more cyclical or annual fluctuations.  I do not think that it is a question of saying that we have this indicator and then we change completely.  We have a rather stable analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1481043600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I have a follow up question but Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay does not need to explain why.

I am not sure it was answered in terms of whether any EU country is actually paying down debt.  The answer given related to ratios.  I am interested in finding out if any country is actually reducing the euro amount of debt.<\/p> <p>  One element of Ireland's debt is the promissory notes which arose out of a deal that was done between the Irish State, the Irish Central Bank and the European Central Bank.  Approximately &euro;20 billion remains to be paid.  At an EU level, that is a small amount but scaled up for Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's country, Spain, it would be about &euro;170 billion or scaled up for Germany it would be about &euro;400 billion.  Given the size of Ireland's economy, a &euro;20 billion debt is very significant.  The debt was incurred at the insistence of Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, who told our Minister for Finance that a bomb would go off in Dublin if he considered burden sharing with private sector investors in private banks.  I believe it to be odious debt, legally and therefore, challengeable.  This promissory note debt is attached solely and exclusively to two dead banks, namely Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, in which the State had no stake or guarantee in place.  The State was essentially forced, in the face of a very serious threat by the then President of the ECB, Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, to pay this money down.  The State wrote an I.O.U which was then subsequently turned into these promissory notes.  Does the Commission believe, in the spirit of reducing debt and in the spirit of social fairness, that Ireland has a case to make to have this debt reduced?  Would the Commission be sympathetic to the argument that a &euro;20 billion is still a serious amount of debt that would, if it were in Germany, amount to &euro;400 billion?  It is an IOU against two dead banks that have been prosecuted for illegal behaviour and for which the State had provided no guarantees.  The State was essentially forced to bail them out by Mr. Trichet.  Is there a case to be made that the Commission would support?  Is there a case for burden sharing or - if one were a monetary purist, as many of the German authorities are - setting it at 0% for 200 years?  In the latter instance, inflation would essentially get rid of it but we would not have to tear it up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016120600002#J00600","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481043600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>First of all, I would not like to comment on any decision taken years ago.

We have seen evidence from the Revenue Commissioners in this regard, and they have spoken elsewhere about the matter.
