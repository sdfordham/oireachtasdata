The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy since the 1950s so I believe that any change that may result from this process will lead to additional opportunities for Ireland.\u00a0 Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location. \u00a0We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland. \u00a0This will not change in the post-BEPS environment.<\/p><p>  At 12.5%, Ireland has the most competitive headline corporate tax rate in the OECD, which is applied to a broad base.\u00a0 Corporate tax rates are a matter of national sovereignty. This Government is committed to maintaining it. <\/p><p>  Ireland's offering of a competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skills, and a reputation for being business friendly is a huge advantage that other countries will struggle to match. \u00a0As international tax loopholes progressively get closed down, our low general corporation tax rate will become even more attractive.<\/p><p>  Indeed as we continue to improve our offering for knowledge based investment, R&amp;amp;D and intellectual property, I believe over the coming years we can continue to grow our share of FDI-related investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[37048\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of the need for social housing and the changed property market, if he will change the mandate of the National Asset Management Agency strategy.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>Section 10 of the NAMA Act outlines clearly the primary objective that the legislature set for NAMA, namely that it achieves the best financial return for the State from the assets entrusted to it. \u00a0NAMA is making very significant progress by reference to this objective.\u00a0 In my recent section 227 Review of NAMA, which the Deputy should be aware of, the NAMA Board have announced renewed\u00a0debt redemption targets. By the end of this year,\u00a0NAMA will have redeemed 50% of its senior debt, two years ahead of schedule, and\u00a0expects to have redeemed 80% of its senior debt by the end of 2016 assuming that market conditions remain strong.\u00a0\u00a0This progress is extremely important in ensuring that Irish taxpayers face no further losses from the banking and property market crash.\u00a0\u00a0It is also extremely important in terms of generating confidence at home and abroad in Ireland's economic recovery.\u00a0\u00a0In their recent decisions to upgrade Ireland's sovereign credit rating, both Standard and Poor's and Moody's highlighted the faster rate at which NAMA is paying down its debt and reducing Ireland's contingent liability.\u00a0\u00a0NAMA is clearly achieving the mandate set for it by the Oireachtas and I do not propose any course of action that could impact on its ability to complete this important work on behalf of Irish taxpayers.<\/p><p>  It is not part of NAMA's statutory remit to supply social housing. \u00a0Nonetheless, and consistent with its commercial objectives, NAMA is making a very significant contribution in facilitating the delivery of social housing through the Housing Agency to local authorities and approved housing bodies.\u00a0 It has made 5,455 houses and apartments available to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing.\u00a0 These 5,455 units\u00a0constitute\u00a0one third of the completed housing stock held in Ireland by NAMA's debtors and receivers\u00a0and\u00a0almost all of\u00a0NAMA's unoccupied housing stock.\u00a0\u00a0NAMA has also\u00a0invested over &euro;20m to date in finishing, refurbishing and fitting out these homes for delivery as\u00a0social housing where local authorities have confirmed demand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  NAMA has no role in determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities.\u00a0 However, NAMA has introduced a number of initiatives to streamline the delivery of homes for which demand has been confirmed.\u00a0\u00a0This includes the establishment of a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS), to expedite the delivery of housing.\u00a0 Through NARPS, NAMA acquires houses and apartments from debtors and receivers and directly leases them to approved housing bodies under long-term leasing arrangements - reducing the initial capital outlay required from the approved housing bodies.\u00a0 In conjunction with the establishment of NARPS, NAMA worked with the housing bodies and introduced standardised leasing terms to further streamline the process.\u00a0 Both these initiatives are working extremely well.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Of the 5,455 properties made available by NAMA, local authorities have confirmed demand for just over 2,000 units.\u00a0 NAMA expects that it will exceed the target of delivering 1,000 of these homes for social housing by the end of 2014 with the remainder being delivered over the following 12-18 months.<\/p><p>  NAMA has also signalled its intention to provide future Part V housing on NAMA-funded residential developments through its social housing SPV, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS).\u00a0 This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates for which it funds development and that such housing will be delivered on-site fully in accordance with Government policy in this area. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, NAMA has stated that it will fund the delivery of some 4,500 new homes in the Dublin area over the period to end-2016. Furthermore, sites held by its debtors and receivers could provide a further 18,000 new homes in the Dublin area and significant additional housing in the other main urban centres in the period beyond 2016.\u00a0 These numbers highlight the substantial contribution that NAMA could make, directly and indirectly, to the delivery of housing stock generally\u00a0and as part of that, the delivery of social housing through Part V over the coming years. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied therefore that, in the context of its overriding commercial mandate, NAMA is doing all that it can to facilitate the supply of social housing and I do not propose to make any changes to its mandate.\u00a0 The statutory clarity given to NAMA by the Oireachtas in 2009 has been very important in guiding the Agency's work and progress to date and I am satisfied that the clarity provided by the fact that its mandate is primarily a commercial mandate has been an important factor in its success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2015","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[37068\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200031#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the updated figures he is using for budget 2015, regarding changes since the April SPU, to include, projected general Government deficit for 2014, SPU at &euro;8 billion, carry forward into 2015 from previous budgetary measures, net or gross changes to the 2015 general Government deficit if there were no changes brought in by budget 2015, that is SPU has approximately &euro;1.5 billion net and the constituent parts of these changes, that is savings due to early IMF loan repayments, revenue take revised upwards, social welfare payments revised downwards and so on.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The Stability Programme Update published in April forecast a deficit of 4.8% of GDP for this year and 2.9% for 2015 underpinned by a consolidation package of &euro;2.0bn.\u00a0 However, the Deputy should be aware that there have been a number of important changes since April, most notably the performance of taxes and impact of the ESA2010 statistical changes introduced by Europe.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In relation to taxes, cumulative tax revenue was up some &euro;971m or 4.1% on profile by the end of August.

Through the introduction of various initiatives, the stability and resilience of the financial sector has been strengthened and restored to a position where it better serves the economies and people of Europe. We have played a crucial role in driving that reform agenda, none more so than during our Presidency in 2013.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  A\u00a0series of measures have been introduced to reduce the risks across the financial system and to minimise the adverse effects\u00a0of future financial crises.\u00a0The Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) significantly enhances depositors' confidence by introducing faster pay-out and more credible funding of the various Deposit Guarantee Schemes. Agreement was\u00a0reached during our presidency on the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation which increases the level and quality of bank capital thereby improving banks' capacity to absorb losses. The package requires banks to build additional capital buffers in good times that can be used in periods of stress. The Directive for Bank Recovery and Resolution (BRRD) is geared at reducing the impact of bank failures on the economy and to help insure that the costs of future failures are not borne by taxpayers. It provides for a more orderly resolution of EU banks thereby minimising the risk of future state interventions to maintain financial stability.<\/p><p>  Measures have also been introduced to address weaknesses in the institutional structures. In this regard, three new European Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board were established in 2011 to improve cross-border cooperation and to ensure consistent enforcement of rules and systemic oversight. The creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS)\u00a0and in particular the three European supervisory authorities, the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), ensure a single regulatory framework and its uniform application across the EU. The\u00a0Single Rulebook for all EU member states\u00a0will mean a common set of rules on supervision, deposit insurance and resolution.\u00a0Building on the single rulebook, the first pillar of banking union is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) which\u00a0transfers key supervisory tasks for significant banks in the euro area to the European Central\u00a0Bank. The second pillar of banking union, the Single Resolution Mechanism\u00a0(SRM), provides for an integrated and effective resolution process for all banks in participating member states including Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Measures have also been brought forward aimed at improving the stability and efficiency of the single market in financial services. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the\u00a0Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR)\u00a0aim to strengthen the protection of investors by making financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent.\u00a0The new framework will also increase the supervisory powers of regulators and provide clear operating rules for all trading activities. The\u00a0European Markets Infrastructure Regulation\u00a0(EMIR)\u00a0provides for more stability, transparency and efficiency in derivatives markets regulation. The funds sector is being overhauled by\u00a0the Alternative\u00a0Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and the\u00a0Money Market Funds Regulation (MMF).\u00a0The AIFMD\u00a0provides Europe-wide regulation for the management of collective investment schemes aimed at professional or qualified investors\u00a0while the\u00a0MMF\u00a0proposal\u00a0provides for\u00a0greater regulation of shadow banking thereby\u00a0safeguarding the integrity of the internal market by addressing the liquidity\u00a0and stability\u00a0of money market funds.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In relation to insurance regulation, the Solvency II\u00a0proposal, coupled with Omnibus II,\u00a0sets out stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection. This new risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings is necessary in order to ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-term investments and additional stability.<\/p><p>  The reform of our statutory code for the financial services sector has been and continues to be driven by the comprehensive set of reforms that have been brought forward at EU level. However, a number of significant domestic legislative reforms have been undertaken\u00a0towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the financial services sector which complements the\u00a0strategically important reforms at EU level. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board, the Central Bank Commission, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank. The unitary Central Bank structure gives the Commission members a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues. In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act was also introduced in 2011. It provides the necessary mechanisms to enable the Central Bank to intervene where a credit institution gets into serious difficulty and is in danger of becoming destabilised or otherwise failing.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.\u00a0 The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. <\/p><p>  The EU financial regulation reform agenda is continuing to strengthen regulation and supervision to improve the stability and functioning of the financial system for the benefit of the economies and people of the EU. \u00a0The financial system has changed significantly since the financial crisis and improved in areas of key importance. I and my Department will continue to work\u00a0with our EU colleagues\u00a0towards providing for a balanced regulatory framework that is consistent with both long-term growth and job creation and a more focused and proactive financial services sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[37063\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the importance he attaches to stability in Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>The importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland's international competitive position is fully appreciated by the Government. \u00a0A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.

These rate increases were necessary to protect the yield from CGT in the context of the rebalancing of the public finances. An increase in the taxation of capital is preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy as compared to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax.<\/p><p>  In common with all taxes, CGT is subject to on-going review and all reliefs and exemptions are carefully considered. In the circumstances in which we have found ourselves in recent years, and as opposed to embedding major long-term changes to the tax system which might prove controversial, divisive or unworkable, the approach (particularly in CGT) has increasingly been to introduce changes which are targeted and which apply for short-term periods to achieve focused outcomes.<\/p><p>  For example, a CGT relief was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2012 to incentivise the purchase of property between 7 December 2011 and the end of 2013 with the intention of stimulating activity in the property market. The incentive was subsequently extended to property purchased to the end of 2014. I stated recently that this relief will not be extended further as it has served its purpose.<\/p><p>  The incentive applies to industrial, farmland, commercial and residential (buy-to-let) property (land and buildings) purchased to the end of this year. If the property is held for more than 7 years, the capital gains attributable to those 7 years will be exempt from CGT on a proportionate basis relative to the period of ownership. Property sold within the 7 year period subsequent to purchase will not qualify for relief.<\/p><p>  Relief for farm restructuring was introduced in Finance Act 2013 on disposals of farm land for the purpose of farm restructuring or consolidation. The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.<\/p><p>  Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Act of 2013 provides for a CGT relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets made on or after 1 January 2010 in certain chargeable business assets. Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval. Discussions with the EU Commission about State Aid clearance are ongoing. I hope that these will result in a positive outcome in the near future. Notwithstanding that the legislative provisions have yet to be commenced, the CGT relief will only apply, among other conditions, where new chargeable business assets acquired after 1 January 2014 \u00a0and up to end- December 2018 are disposed of having been held for a minimum period of 3 years after acquisition in that period.<\/p><p>  Over the years other reliefs that had been in place for a number of years were reviewed and abolished or restricted. These included roll-over relief\u00a0and indexation relief. \u00a0The relevance of these reliefs had to be weighed against what they were achieving, the cost of the reliefs and the opportunities for providing other more relevant relieving measures.<\/p><p>  In the context of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process, I will again consider what changes can be made to the CGT regime in order to encourage and facilitate investment in our improving economic environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[37047\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to implement the recent OECD BEPS report including through legislation.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is no doubt aware we are\u00a0almost at\u00a0the halfway point in the OECD BEPS project.

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank's latest 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics' publication for the end of Quarter 2 2014 (), shows that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in arrears, fell for the fourth consecutive quarter and at the end of June 2014, 90,343 (11.8 per cent) primary dwelling mortgage accounts were more than 90 days in arrears, representing a decline of 3% over the quarter.<br\/><br\/>Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, a monthly reporting regime on mortgage restructures and arrears for the six main banks covered by the\u00a0Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART)\u00a0has been put in place by my Department.\u00a0 The latest publication, with data to the end of July, shows that the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen by over 7,000 accounts when compared to the end of Q1 2014 while the total number of PDH mortgage arrears has fallen by 8,800 accounts in the same period.<br\/><br\/>The data published by my Department, as well as the Central Bank data, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in mortgage arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.\u00a0 However, increased\u00a0engagement in this area by the financial institutions will be necessary to address the situation of those remaining\u00a0householders facing\u00a0difficulties in meeting their mortgage commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[37059\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200032#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the National Asset Management Agency has not made greater progress in supplying social housing to date; the way this can be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>The Deputy's premise is incorrect as NAMA has made significant numbers of housing units available through the Housing Agency to local authorities and approved housing bodies.\u00a0 As the Deputy is aware, NAMA was established firstly to acquire property and related loans from five financial institutions so as to remove this systemic risk to the Irish banking system and secondly, to obtain the best achievable financial return to the State from these acquired loans. \u00a0It is not part of NAMA's statutory remit to supply housing.

This endorsement function has been set out in an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 and has been assigned to the Fiscal Council. <\/p><p>  Since its establishment, the Council has published six Fiscal Assessment Reports, all of which can be found on the Fiscal Council's website. I respond to these reports, usually in my next fiscal policy publication. However, given the gap between the last Fiscal Assessment Report in June 2014 and the publication of the Budget in October, I responded to the Council in writing on 22 July 2014. My response can be found on the websites of the Council and my own Department. The establishment of the Council has strengthened the fiscal governance of the country and its reports have widened and deepened the debate on fiscal policy.<\/p><p>  The Fiscal Council have also published a number of other papers, including a Pre-Budget paper on 22 September. This laid out the Council's recommendation that, despite the Exchequer returns, the benefits flowing from the switch over to ESA 2010 and the improved economic environment, consolidation of the order of &euro;2 billion should take place in Budget 2015.<\/p><p>  The Council maintain their consolidation recommendation for a number of reasons -<\/p><p>  -   in order to break the boom and bust pattern and show commitment to a new fiscal policy stance<\/p><p>  -   to return to sustainable medium-term economic growth and put debt on a strong downward path, and<\/p><p>  -   to comfortably secure compliance with the 3% general government deficit target<\/p><p>  The Council also recommends against any cuts in the Government's revenue-raising capacity, due to the considerable challenges it feels the Government faces in maintaining tight expenditure control. <\/p><p>  I note the views expressed by the Fiscal Council in the update of their fiscal stance, and their suggestions with regard to consolidation in Budget 2015. I agree wholeheartedly with the Council's view that we need to break the pattern of boom and bust economics and said so on many occassions. The Government has implemented a number of measures as part of a new fiscal framework to prevent the cyclical pressures of the past from driving fiscal policy, including multi-annual ministerial expenditure ceilings and greater fiscal transparency.<\/p><p>  We are required to deliver a deficit of no more than 2.9% of GDP in 2015, we will do what is needed to achieve this target. It looks likely that we can achieve our target without any further expenditure cuts or tax increases. This Government's track record is there for all to see. Each year we have continued to either meet or exceeded our deficit targets. The economy has returned to growth and jobs are being created. The objective of the upcoming Budget is both to broaden, deepen and secure this recovery.We will continue to be prudent and take the\u00a0necessary\u00a0steps to deliver metium-term growth and put our debt levels on a downward path.<\/p><p>  With regard\u00a0to the longer term outlook, the forthcoming Budget will show a multi-annual path towards a more balanced budgetary position.\u00a0 This timeframe reflects the Government's desire to provide certainty to Irish people over the medium term.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Finally, I agree with the Fiscal Council that taking account of demographic and other challenges, maintaining tight expenditure control will be tough.\u00a0 However, taking tough decisions is the role of Government and something that we have shown a proven track record over recent years.\u00a0 The hard decisions of recent years have paid off and I am confident that we are best placed to drive the recovery forward into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200033#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200033#WRC00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200033#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[37457\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200033#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a matter (details supplied) relating to PRSI benefits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The dental benefit scheme continues to provide for free annual examinations to qualifying customers who fulfil the PRSI eligibility criteria.

The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. <br\/><br\/>Overall, this has resulted in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices<font color=\"#004080\">,<\/font>where a full range of services will be available in one location.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  <br\/><br\/>Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. <br\/><br\/>A review of the maximum rent limits is being undertaken within the Department. This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies, landlord representative groups and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Any changes to social welfare supports can only be considered in a budgetary context.<br\/><br\/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally. <br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. <br\/><br\/>In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, over 120 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department. <br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year. The increase in economic activity was broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.<\/p><p>  Exports rose by 13% in the year to the second quarter of 2014. \u00a0This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001 and there is growing evidence that the impact of the patent expiry issue in the pharmaceutical sector has passed.<\/p><p>  Consumer spending on goods\u00a0has been strong in the first eight months of this year. \u00a0Retail sales in the period January to August were up 7% when compared with the same period in 2013.\u00a0 Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up 3.5% over the same period. \u00a0Investment is also growing, with both building and construction and machinery and equipment activity rising.\u00a0 Recovery in the construction sector continued in August with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording a 13th successive month of expansion.<\/p><p>  Recovery is\u00a0also evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters representing an increase of over 70,000 since the low point in mid-2012. \u00a0In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.1\u00a0per cent at the end of\u00a0September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012.  Ireland's competitiveness has significantly improved in recent years.\u00a0 Low\u00a0consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to the euro area. \u00a0For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2008.

These changes have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extension of maturities. We have also negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. In addition, I am proposing to make an early repayment of a portion of Ireland's IMF programme loan. <\/p><p>  When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. <\/p><p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).\u00a0 It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans.\u00a0\u00a0As of July 2014 the all in euro equivalent cost of our EU-IMF programme loans was estimated at 3.4%.<\/p><p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to 12.5 and 15 years respectively.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.\u00a0\u00a0 This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including increasing the weighted average life from c.7-8 years for the Promissory Notes to c.34-35 years for the floating rate notes.<\/p><p>  Finally, as you will be aware, I am proposing to make an early repayment of a portion of Ireland's IMF programme loan. Specifically\u00a0the proposal is\u00a0to make an early repayment of up to &euro;18.3 billion of our &euro;22.5 billion\u00a0IMF loan,\u00a0which is\u00a0the portion\u00a0subject to the highest rate of charge, and to replace it\u00a0with less expensive market funding subject to prevailing market conditions.<\/p><p>  For this to succeed,\u00a0 a waiver of the mandatory proportional early repayment clauses which are included in each of our loan agreements with the EFSF and the EFSM, and with our bilateral lenders, the U.K., Denmark and Sweden is required.<\/p><p>  There was\u00a0broad political support among Ministers when the issue was discussed at the Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings last month.

As statutory regulator of credit institutions, the Central Bank has the power, from both a prudential and consumer protection perspective, to require banks to meaningfully and sustainably address mortgage arrears cases on their books.

To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small business, and the establishment of the SME State Bodies Group has also provided a forum where this issue is discussed and policy options explored on a regular basis.<br\/><br\/>The following\u00a0is an overview of the main\u00a0policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small business:<br\/><br\/>- With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over\u00a0twenty Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports. In the\u00a0 four months\u00a0since its launch, this website has had over 17,000 unique visits. The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .<br\/><br\/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has been established by the Government as a means of ensuring that SMEs in Ireland are provided with sufficient finance for growth. As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation enabling the establishment of the SBCI was passed by the Oireachtas prior to the Summer recess and the SBCI was incorporated as a company in September. The company is already operational with the immediate priorities being the finalisation of the funding\u00a0arrangements for the company and establishing mechanisms to enable credit to flow quickly to the small business sector.\u00a0 This work is well advanced. Loan agreements with the international funders, KfW and the European Investment Bank, will be signed in the coming weeks. Following that, the SBCI will agree lending terms with traditional bank lenders and new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector allowing for the distribution of SBCI funding\u00a0to\u00a0the SME sector in Ireland on a prudent basis.\u00a0 I anticipate that the\u00a0first SBCI funded loans to SMEs\u00a0should be available for disbursement before the end of this year. <br\/><br\/>- Another important initiative stemming from the work of the SME State Bodies Group is the &quot;Finance4Growth&quot; programme offered by Managementworks. This provides participants with access to an SME finance expert who will explain the different sources of finance available, guide them as to which would be most relevant to their business, and advise on how banks, investors and agencies make their decisions. This mentoring is free, and there is also an option to avail of a one-day finance workshop and a further two hours of mentoring for a small fee. It is important that businesses seeking finance are equipped with as much expertise as possible to ensure that they can provide lending institutions with strong evidence that they have strong repayment capacity and this programme provides them with exactly that.<br\/><br\/>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which should broaden the scope of the scheme to encourage higher utilisation.<br\/><br\/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices\u00a0 nationally to administer this fund.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the\u00a0key engine of ongoing economic growth.\u00a0 Consequently\u00a0the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200040#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Prices","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200040#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[37584\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200040#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which house price inflation continues to be monitored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>The most recent Residential Property Price Index for August 2014 published by the Central Statistics Office indicates that national residential property prices increased by 2.3 per cent between July and August and by 14.9 per cent on an annual basis.

If Kerry County Council submits an application for funding in respect of Kilmoyley it will be assessed under the eligibility criteria of the Scheme, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, having regard to the OPW's overall availability of funding.

A detailed assessment is being carried out under the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking this in partnership with the relevant local authorities including Kerry County Council.  Draft flood maps have been produced for Moneycashen and were subject to a public consultation day that was held in Ballyduff on 24th September 2014.  Feedback from that event and a forthcoming national consultation process will be taken account of before the flood maps are finalised.  Subsequent phases of the Shannon CFRAM Study will involve an options assessment process followed by the preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans.  Further information and updates on the Shannon CFRAM Study are available on .<br\/><br\/>The Office of Public Works has recently completed the refurbishment of 2,000m of flood defences on the River Cashen at Derryco and other works are ongoing in the area.  OPW has also recently extended flood defences at Rahoonagh on the Cashen for a length of 500m to provide protection to a number of houses in the area.<br\/><br\/>OPW has also carried out an examination of the feasibility of dredging the River Feale\/Cashen estuary.  This examination has concluded that while this dredging would provide some relief to the flooding problem in the area, it is likely to cost several million euro, and that there is little likelihood of funding for this being available in the foreseeable future.  Further, because this area is a Special Area of Conservation and a Natural Heritage Area of European importance, significant constraints will apply to any work.  In the short to medium term, the OPW will consider the installation of localised pumping facilities as funds and resources allow, in the polders worst affected by flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200040#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200041#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[37527\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200041#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the unprecedented number of appeals lodged with the Valuation Tribunal arising from the revaluation of rateable properties in Dublin city and County Waterford; if additional staff will be deployed to the tribunal to supplement its current small cohort of staff to process appeals in an expeditious manner; if such extra staff will be deployed from the Office of the Commissioner of Valuation which is the respondent in all valuation appeals heard by the tribunal; and if so, if there will be measures put in place to ensure the knowledge of procedures, work practices and other confidential information pertinent to the tribunal and acquired by such staff will not be used by the office of the commissioner upon the return of the aforementioned temporarily redeployed staff.","asker":"1110","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>In recognition of the\u00a0increased volume of appeals to the Valuation Tribunal arising from the revaluation of Dublin City and Waterford rating authority areas my Department approved\u00a0\u00a0last August\u00a0a proposal\u00a0\u00a0for the secondment\/redeployment of seven staff,\u00a0one Higher Executive Officer (Assistant Registrar),\u00a0two Executive Officers and\u00a0four Clerical Officers to the Valuation Tribunal on a temporary basis to cover the period when these appeals will be heard.<\/p><p>  Given the importance of the national revaluation programme and the fact that there\u00a0was no capacity in the Valuation Office at the time\u00a0to assign staff to the Tribunal\u00a0my Department's\u00a0sanction\u00a0allowed for the\u00a0temporary filling of these vacancies either from the central redeployment panel or by secondment.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Commissioner of Valuation and the Valuation Tribunal are independent in the exercise of their functions and it is a matter for them to\u00a0 make their own operational arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200041#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Records","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200041#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[37549\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200041#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number and location of sites at which the Office of Public Works store public records which are ultimately intended to be forwarded to the National Archives in time; for which Departments of State and agencies are records stored at each site; the total cost in 2012 and 2013 for the storage of these records broken down by costs borne by the OPW and costs borne by another Department at each site; the number of staff employed at each site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy, as it relates to the Office of Public Works, is not readily available in the format requested.

However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board <\/i><\/b><b>- <\/b>Expressions of interest for appointment to the Board of the Charities Regulatory Authority were sought through the Public Appointments Service.  Sixteen appointments were subsequently made to the Board of the Authority; thirteen of those appointed applied through the Public Appointments Service.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management <\/i><\/b>- One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.  The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board <\/i><\/b><b>-<\/b>There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of forty-four applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Courts Service Board <\/i><\/b>- The Courts Service Board has seventeen members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice.  There have been 20 appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. including a civil servant from my Department.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board <\/i><\/b><b>-<\/b>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.

The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission <\/i><\/b><b>-<\/b>The Commission consists of three members, a Chairman and two members.  These positions were advertised through the Public Appointments Service following which 40 applications were received.  Three candidates were selected by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. and approved by Government as having the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for the relevant roles.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission <\/i><\/b><b>-<\/b>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Human Rights Commission three Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May 2012.  In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media.  The fourteen Members Designate of the new Commission were selected in April 2013 in a process independent of Government and appointed initially to the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission on an interim basis so that the two organisations could begin to operate as a cohesive whole.  Following this experience, it was decided that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) should be responsible henceforth for selection of Commissioners, including Chief Commissioner post.<br\/><br\/>  The Government appointed the fourteen individuals as Members Designate of the Human Rights Commission in advance of the enactment and commencement of the required legislation.  On 31 May 2013 the then Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Alan Shatter T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended.<br\/><br\/>  Emily Logan was recently nominated by the PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting of the 23 July 2014 Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.  She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.<br\/><br\/>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed by the President on the 27 July 2014.  It is expected that Ms. Logan's formal appointment and the formal appointment of the other fourteen members designate of the new IHREC will then be made by the President following the passing of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board <\/i><\/b><b>- <\/b>Eleven appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.

The Act also stipulates that in making appointments &quot;<i>the Minister shall have regard to the objective that a majority of the Authority would be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, and, in the case of each member of the Authority, that he or she would have knowledge or experience, either directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability or of any other subject which in the opinion of the Minister would be of assistance to the Authority in the performance of its functions&quot; .<\/i>The Act also makes reference to the objective that not less than 5 women and 5 men be appointed to the Board; and to the desirability that its members would include persons from both rural and urban areas.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Parole Board <\/i><\/b><b>-<\/b>Eleven appointments were made to the Parole Board.

In recent years the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also now have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  <br\/><br\/>At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations.

An Garda Sioch&aacute;na are continuing to investigate these complaints and are liaising with the injured parties.  Contact has also been made with Revenue's Customs Service who take the enforcement lead nationally in relation to this issue and who have arranged to have fuel samples from these cases analysed for contaminants.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the overall national position, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a number of reports of problems relating to petrol quality from around the country in recent weeks and that such reports are followed up as a matter of course and samples sent to the State Laboratory for analysis where officers have reason to suspect excise duty fraud. <br\/><br\/>Petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.  Under Section 102 of the Finance Act 1999, it is an offence to sell and\/or deliver oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid. <br\/><br\/>In the normal course of work, Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel, which are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis, from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations.  If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. <br\/><br\/>I am further advised that Revenue and the oil sector have co-operated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and are confident that, with this co-operation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.  In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel. <br\/><br\/>In addition, motorists themselves should take care with regard to their source of petrol and report any suspicions concerning adulterated fuel which may have damaged their engines to Revenue who will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  In that regard Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website at www.revenue.ie specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1- Complaints re suspected petrol contamination to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na Mayo's Division June - September 2014 <\/b><table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th>Claremorris District<\/th><th>Ballina District<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200045#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200045#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[37532\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200045#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a stamp 4 application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the person mentioned by the Deputy applied for a change of immigration status on 10 February 2014.

These include the introduction of minimum qualification standards for those working directly with children in the pre-school sector.<\/p><p>  Amendments have been made to the Child Care Act 1991 to underpin the proposed reforms and Regulations giving effect to these legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  The new Regulations will impose qualification requirements of a minimum Level 5 award on the National Qualifications Framework (NFQ) in early childhood care and education for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  This requirement applies from September 2014 in the case of new services, and from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  In addition, the minimum qualification requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from a Level 5 award to a Level 6, from the same dates.<\/p><p>  In light of the proposed timeframes for the introduction of new qualification requirements, the Department has sought to work with the childcare sector to accelerate the process for training and upskilling staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  Some &euro;0.9 million was provided to support a training programme in 2013 to provide support to staff who are seeking to meet the qualification requirements.  <\/p><p>  In March of this year, the Learner Fund was launched.  This Fund, which has an allocation of &euro;3 million over the two years 2014 and 2015 and is sufficient to support all eligible applicants, is designed to support existing childcare staff to up-skill to meet new qualification requirements.  The Learner Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees.  The fund closed for applications from childcare staff at the end of April this year but it is hoped to make further funding available later this year which will provide for additional places for staff seeking training support.  <\/p><p>  Working with children in an early childhood care and education setting is a professional role which requires the achievement of core skills and knowledge including Child Development 0-6, Early Learning Theory and Practice and Child Health and Welfare as well as a supervised practicuum.  For the purposes of my Department's childcare programmes, it recognises certain qualifications as being equivalent to NFQ qualifications for its purposes.  However, the content must include the topics listed.  <\/p><p>  In relation to childcare services providing the free pre-school provision under the ECCE programme, it is currently a requirement that the pre-school leader hold a major award at level 5 or an equivalent qualification.  Completion of part of a degree programme does not meet the requirement for a major award. It is the responsibility of childcare services participating in the programme to submit to my Department documentary evidence that the pre-school leader in the service holds the required qualifications.  All applications will be evaluated and the service advised of the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200047#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200047#WRR01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Clinical Indemnity Scheme","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200047#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[37459\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200047#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a matter (details supplied) in relation to insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) covers the clinical activities of public health doctors, nurses, dentists and other community based clinical staff providing services on behalf of the Health Services Executive (HSE). <\/p><p>  Apart from this Scheme, the Clinical Indemnity Scheme does not provide indemnity to healthcare professionals who are providing private services in the community (i.e. those who are not providing services on behalf of the HSE).

While it appeared before the summer to be the intention of President Obama and his Administration to examine the scope for action on immigration via executive authority, President Obama announced on September 6 that he would delay any such action until after the November US elections. <\/p><p>  The exact extent, nature and timing of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be confirmed and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved via executive action.  However, in my contacts in Washington, including in my conversation with the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, I stressed the importance of addressing the needs and concerns of the undocumented Irish migrants in any such action. There are of course limits to what executive action is likely to be able to do and so further progress on the legislative track is also necessary. <\/p><p>  While there appears to be some willingness to consider further action in Congress at some future point, this is dependent on many factors and will not be easy to achieve. The Government will continue to work resolutely for progress over the coming months from which currently undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. and their families can benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200053#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Issues","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200053#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[37534\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100200053#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the issues discussed at his recent meeting with the UN Secretary General; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>In the course of my recent visit to New York for the General Assembly of the United Nations I had the opportunity to meet the Secretary General of the Organisation, His Excellency Ban Ki Moon.

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances. While I am aware of the service that can be provided by the Public Appointments Service, I would point out that the arrangements I have outlined provide for a wide and varied process of selection for appointment <\/p><p>  All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.<\/p><p>  In 2011 there were 31 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 3 appointments were made.
