This ensures that, where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials throughout the country are actively engaged at a local level with the Homeless Action Teams (HATs) and Non-Government Organisations working in the area of homelessness and its prevention. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s rent supplement scheme plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016.  There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 during the first three months of 2016 showing that significant numbers of individuals and families are being accommodated under the scheme. <\/p><p>The Department has implemented a national targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this arrangement to commuter areas over the coming weeks.  This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,570 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rental payments.  A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the table for information.<\/p><p>The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to the local authorities.  The Department is fully engaged in the roll out of this scheme which is operational in 19 local authority areas and officials continue to work closely with colleagues in the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  <\/p><p>I believe these measures and the recent legislative reforms announced to the private rental sector provide a level of stability for those who require support in what has become a highly volatile rental market.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement <\/b><b>- Increased Rental Payments by County as at 18\/04\/2016<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework<\/th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold<\/th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>35<\/td><td><\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>22<\/td><td><\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>60<\/td><td><\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>349<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>422<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>-<\/td><td><\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>3,003<\/td><td>1,958<\/td><td>4,961<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>155<\/td><td><\/td><td>155<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>51<\/td><td><\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>353<\/td><td><\/td><td>353<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>127<\/td><td><\/td><td>127<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>112<\/td><td><\/td><td>112<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM<\/td><td>64<\/td><td><\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>128<\/td><td><\/td><td>128<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>122<\/td><td><\/td><td>122<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>3<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>294<\/td><td><\/td><td>294<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>60<\/td><td><\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON<\/td><td>24<\/td><td><\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO<\/td><td>-<\/td><td><\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>165<\/td><td><\/td><td>165<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>39<\/td><td><\/td><td>39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>173<\/td><td><\/td><td>173<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>15<\/td><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>177<\/td><td><\/td><td>177<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Overall Total<\/td><td>5,539<\/td><td>2,031<\/td><td>7,570<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":7,"content":"<p>Question No. 2 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[7840\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason an application under the carer's allowance scheme by a person (details supplied) in County Louth has been refused in view of the medical evidence supplied; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 4 December 2015.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of <i>10 years<\/i>of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate.  <\/p><p>Working part-time does not generally reduce entitlement, as part-time workers also pay weekly PRSI contributions, and these will generally be of equal value to the more expensive contributions paid by full-time workers.<\/p><p>However absences from the labour force - when contributions were neither deducted from pay nor credited in respect of a social welfare payment, and where voluntary contributions were not made &ndash; may impact upon the rate of a person&rsquo;s pension.  This can be mitigated by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for some people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994 and took effect for such homemaking periods from that date, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It should be noted however that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied. <\/p><p>If someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Appeals","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[7882\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100038#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) will have a decision on an appeal for supplementary welfare allowance.","asker":"1268","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The person in question applied for assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme for repairs to reading glasses.

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.<\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.  The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.<\/p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.

The rent allowance costs &euro;4,600 per officer per annum (inclusive of Employer's PRSI).<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner who is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote has informed me that the annual cost to the Garda Vote, of reinstating the rent allowance for all recently attested Garda members would amount to &euro;1.8 million.  In addition, the annual costs of granting the rent allowance to existing student Garda&iacute; upon attestation would be a further &euro;1.4 million, giving a total for those recruited since recruitment recommenced in 2014 of &euro;3.2 million.  Obviously, that cost would increase by &euro;4,600 for every Garda recruited into the future. <\/p><p>In December 2010 the then Government approved the reduction by 10% of the incremental salary scale for new entrants to traditional recruitment grades in the public service, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to achieve a structural reduction in the cost of the public service.  Under the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement para. 2.31, the imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date was required to be addressed by the preparation of revised incremental salary scales for new entrants.  The pay scales now converge.  Accordingly, the current position in relation to pay for new recruits is that<font color=\"#181818\"> trainee Garda&iacute; are supported while completing their 2 year BA in Applied Policing.  For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a<\/font>basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College.  After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750.  The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  It is important to recall that the Garda pay scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances.  Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments.  Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings.  Even at the entry level of &euro;23,750 and the lower end of unsocial hours scale, this will add almost &euro;6,000 to the salary.  Other allowances may also be payable, as may overtime.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Lansdowne Road Agreement represents <font color=\"#181818\">the agreed structure for industrial relations and pay within the public service<\/font>until 2018.  It provides for <font color=\"#181818\">the gradual unwinding of the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants at a cost of &euro;844m over three years.  It is underpinned by the <\/font>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015  <font color=\"#181818\"> (FEMPI).  All public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, have started to receive the benefits of that Agreement in the form of reductions in the rate of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) payable.  For the majority of public servants, in addition to the PRD benefits, there is a significant reduction, weighted in favour of the lower paid, of the pay reductions suffered under the 2009 FEMPI legislation.\u00a0 These come in the form of increases in gross pay and are incorporated in the pay scale referred to above.<\/font><\/p><p>I recognise that public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery and I understand their frustrations at the pace of pay restoration.  It is, however, essential that a prudent and sustainable approach is adopted given the current resources available and fiscal restraints on spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100039#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100039#WRB03450"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[7886\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100039#WRB03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a criminal investigation into allegations (details supplied) has been instigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; if the Garda has taken possession of these files; if not, the reasons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[7888\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100039#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the Tuam, County Galway, site has not been cordoned off as a crime scene in view of the information in an article (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the instigation and management of any criminal investigation is a matter for the Garda authorities, as are any operational steps which might be taken in relation to the gathering and preservation of evidence.

In fact during the last three months of 2015 the national burglary rate reduced by 26.2% compared to the same period in 2014, and this trend is also reflected in the figures for Co Louth which shows a decrease of 24% insofar as the same period is concerned.

Furthermore, since 2012, an overall amount of &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015.

Allegations of abuse can be made against anyone, including foster carers, biological parents, family members, friends, professionals, other children and in some cases, people unknown to the child. <\/p>  <p>  The foster care regulations require an allocated social worker to meet with the child, in private, on a regular basis to talk with the child, including asking about any worries they may have and to work towards the child's ongoing happiness and progress in a placement.  Where an allegation or concern is made to a social worker by a child, it is their responsibility to ensure the concern is listened to and to respond accordingly.  The immediate safety of the child is always central in responding to any allegation of physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect.  Following an allegation the overall safety of the child is considered.  Where possible, they will remain with their foster carers to allow for stability and ongoing support in such circumstances.  The allocated social worker will also review the child's care plan and arrange for specialist assessments to determine what therapeutic or medical services are required. <\/p>  <p>  Support is provided to the child making the allegation by their social worker.  If one of the 7% of children in foster care without an allocated social worker (407 children at the end of January 2016) makes an allegation of abuse a social worker will be immediately allocated to ensure that all their needs are met and the proper support can be given in such difficult times.  Where abuse has been alleged by a child living in foster care, the link social worker will ensure the foster carers can support the child to the best of their ability.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla notifies all allegations of abuse to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  All children, not just children in care, who have been sexually abused have two distinct needs in relation to services.  The first need is timely access to specialist assessment, including, if necessary, medical\/forensic services and where sexual abuse is validated, children need a therapeutic response shaped to their needs.  Their families and carers also need support and guidance at this time.  It is vital that all agencies involved in assessment, investigation and providing support and therapeutic services to children and their families work together.  The HSE, Tusla and CARI (a voluntary based organisation) along with others, provide counselling, therapeutic and family support to children who have been abused sexually. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Administration","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[7822\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if finance for home care packages and home help assistance have been curtailed since January 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

If you have not received a reply from the NMBI within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office  and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>  <p>  However, I would like to advise the Deputy of a number of measures taken by the NMBI and to put the perceived registration delays in context.<\/p>  <p>  A significant volume of applications has been received by the NMBI, particularly during 2015.  Many of the applications received to date are incomplete whereby documents remain outstanding on a file and therefore cannot be progressed to review\/assessment stage until required documents are received.  In addition, many applicants, unfortunately do not complete their application form fully therefore leading to delays in progressing an application through the system. <\/p>  <p>  The NMBI have put a number of contact channels in place for applicants following up on the progress of their application.  One such measure was introduced in October 2015 which  was the opening of a dedicated call centre line for overseas applicants.  This call centre is open  Monday through to Friday, 9.00am to 5.30pm.  The call centre can provide regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application.  The NMBI has launched a new website during February 2016 which will have additional features for overseas applicants to include a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on line.   <\/p>  <p>  The NMBI is working with its stakeholders, including HSE, to provide options for nurses who are required to obtain additional competencies in order to meet the requirements for registration.  Such options include the adaptation course and an aptitude test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC03350"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[7856\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100040#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will refund a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15 who purchased medical equipment under the drug repayment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>As the particular issue raised relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to you.

I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s steadfast support for the peace talks between the government and the FARC rebels.  These talks are now at a critical stage, and Ireland intends to contribute to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia which will be launched once a peace deal is signed.  I also expressed appreciation for the work of Mr. Eamon Gilmore who was present in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process.  Mr. Gilmore is tasked with providing visibility for the diverse strands of the EU&rsquo;s efforts in the country and conveying the EU&rsquo;s political support for the peace process, bringing to bear his experience in peacebuilding and reconciliation on this island.<\/p><p>Foreign Ministers also briefly discussed the latest developments in the negotiations towards an Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur.  Supported by a number of other Member States, I emphasised the need to proceed with caution in order to ensure a balanced agreement which takes account of the potential impact on the agricultural and other sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100042#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Ministerial Council","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100042#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[7860\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100042#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he put forward at North-South Ministerial Council meetings in relation to the establishment of additional cross-Border bodies as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement; the outcome of such discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and local authorities in addition to the Department's own school enrolment databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p><p>The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, I announced the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p>The school planning areas in Co. Wexford are experiencing demographic growth, however, not to such an extent that would currently warrant new school provision.  These areas are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in each of the school planning areas.<\/p><p>There are 22 post-primary schools in the nine school planning areas in Co Wexford.  The majority of the school planning areas are projected to increase in enrolment numbers, although the total enrolment numbers are marginally less than projected based on the provisional 2015\/16 enrolment data.  Overall, enrolments are projected to increase by circa 2,900 between the 22 schools, to peak in 2024\/25, before beginning to reduce.  The intake patterns to the schools show that a significant proportion of students are not attending the post-primary school in their area but rather travelling out of the smaller school planning areas into the Wexford town and Enniscorthy areas to attend post-primary school.<\/p><p>In relation to the Wexford town school planning area, my Department analysed the pre-enrolment lists of students seeking places in First Year in September 2016 from the 12 post-primary schools in the Wexford town and four adjacent school planning areas of Enniscorthy, Adamstown, Kilmuckridge and Bridgetown.  This analysis showed that there was a large amount of duplication of applications with students applying to a number of schools in these areas and the intake patterns showed that a significant proportion of students who live outside the Wexford town school planning area have applied to attend schools in the Wexford town area.<\/p><p>Based on the provisional 2015\/16 post-primary enrolment figures in the Wexford town schools, actual enrolments are broadly in line with the projected enrolments based on the demographic data.  In the five post-primary schools in the Wexford town school planning area, total enrolments are projected to grow over the next six year, peaking in 2021\/22, after which enrolment numbers are projected to drop back to below current levels.  <\/p><p>Based on the provisional 2015\/16 post-primary enrolments in Gorey, these are marginally higher than projected. There are two post-primary schools serving the Gorey school planning area.  Enrolments are expected to grow peaking in 2024-2025, after which enrolment numbers are expected to decrease.<\/p><p>As part of my Department's School Capital Investment Programme, a number of building projects in Wexford schools are being progressed, including Loreto Secondary School and Wexford C.B.S, which will provide for increased capacity in the area.

RAS is a social housing support targeted primarily at those already in receipt of Rent Supplement for over 18 months.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020 &ndash; Support, Supply and Reform<\/i>recognises that RAS continues to be a successful programme that has achieved considerable output levels to date and delivered quality housing to a large number of households.  Over the lifetime of the Strategy, an additional 6,000 households are targeted to transfer from Rent Supplement to RAS.<\/p><p>The long term vision for Rent Supplement is the transition of households with an established housing need to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP which is being introduced incrementally on a pilot basis to local authority areas enables local authorities to immediately provide housing assistance for households who qualify for social housing support, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. <\/p><p>Similar to the RAS, the HAP Scheme will facilitate the removal of a potential barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP commenced in September 2014 and some 8,500 households are currently being supported by the scheme.  HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas.  Until such time as HAP becomes operational in the remaining local authority areas, Rent Supplement will continue to be available to those households requiring support in meeting their housing needs in the rental market.<\/p><p>In terms of rent limits that apply in respect of Rent Supplement, I understand that the Department of Social Protection undertook a review of these limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.  The Department of Social Protection has instead implemented a targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the Rent Supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rent supplement levels are increased above prescribed limits, where appropriate.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to other urban and commuter areas.  This flexible and targeted approach assists Rent Supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent supplement payments.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that in the context of supply in the private rented market, the Equal Status Act 2000 has recently been amended to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential property to people who are in receipt of Rent Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Persons who feel they have been discriminated against by on the housing assistance ground, or any other protected ground, in relation to the provision of accommodation may wish to contact the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p><p>In addition, in a new measure, landlords who rent to tenants in receipt of rent supplement or social housing supports may avail of increased tax relief with effect from 1 January 2016.\u00a0 To qualify, landlords must undertake to make the accommodation available to qualifying tenants for a minimum of three years, and the undertaking must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).\u00a0 Qualifying property owners can claim 100 per cent\u00a0relief on their mortgage interest, as an expense against rental income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Expenditure","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03050"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[7833\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if, regarding the planned infrastructural investment by Irish Water of &euro;4 billion over the period 2016-2021, he will provide a breakdown of the annual State expenditure from the &euro;4 billion over the relevant years and the intended source of funds for the &euro;4 billion.","asker":"1288","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment in the period 2016 to 2021 will be funded by a mix of debt and equity (including capital transfers from Government), with the investment programme for the period after end 2016 being subject to future review by the Commission for Energy Regulation, and Government funding being subject to future budgetary decisions.

The current MPI premium is charged at 0.4703% of the outstanding capital loan balance as at 1 January each year.  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable individual MPI policy from the market.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market.  Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the Local Authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors are the main influences on the price of the Local Authority MPI scheme:<\/p>  <p>  (i)  standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;<\/p>  <p>  (ii)  the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;<\/p>  <p>  (iii)  the terms and conditions of the Local Authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that\u00a0all eligible local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; and<\/p>  <p>  (iv)  the claims experience of the Local Authority MPI scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority MPI scheme also provides extra benefits, such as:<\/p>  <p>  -  mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result of disability;<\/p>  <p> -  separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the event of a member&rsquo;s death; and<\/p>  <p> -  members are covered for death up to age 75 whereas standard MPI cover usually ceases at the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.  In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee were able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme.  As part of the upcoming re-tendering process, the Committee will seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017, the most appropriate Mortgage Protection Insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03650"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[7890\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100043#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of planning applications invalidated by Cork County Council western division from 1 January 2016 to 31 March 2016; and the number of instances where prospective invalidations were avoided because the planners contacted the applicants in time to allow them to remedy small defects in the planning applications without recourse to invalidation as recommended in the planning guidelines.","asker":"1291","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>Planning statistics are submitted by planning authorities on an annual basis and are subsequently collated by my Department.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. <\/p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. <\/p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. <\/p><p>The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March.  The responses are now being assessed in line with criteria set down by the Department with a view to selecting qualified provider(s) to proceed to the next stage of the procurement. \u00a0This second stage in\u00a0the process will be a formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted\u00a0 bidders.<\/p><p>The 2020 map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention.<\/p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators 78% of the townlands of Kilcannon, 88%of the townland of \u00a0Ballymurn Upper and 98% of the townland of Ballymurn Lower in Co Wexford will be covered by commercial operators. \u00a0The remaining 22% of the townland of Kilcannon, 12%of the townland of Ballymurn Upper and 2% of the townland of Ballymurn Lower will be part of the State intervention.\u00a0 Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and\/or address, or scrolling through the map. <\/p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible.  The procurement process is underway and it is proposed to engage with the winning bidder(s) in due course on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand.  All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network rollout and will be agreed during the procurement process. <\/p><p>Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the rollout in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.  In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of all premises in Ireland (both commercial and intervention area) will have access to high speed broadband within two years of the contract award, with 100% of premises connected within 5 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100045#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100045#WRH00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100045#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[7845\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042100045#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the proposed bypasses for Macroom and Ballyvourne, County Cork, to ensure proper access between counties Cork and Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>\u200b\u200bAs Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII, formerly known as the National Roads Authority) under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.
