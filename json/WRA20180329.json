Further new apprenticeships are to be submitted to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) for validation shortly and, subject to successful validation, will get underway in 2018. In addition, a key commitment in our plan for last year was to issue a second call for apprenticeship proposals to refresh the pipeline of apprenticeship proposals established through the first call.

However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.

The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been very active, while our Embassy in Washington DC is engaged with the Administration and with contacts on Capitol Hill on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, whether over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period or at other times, the Government has been exploring a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other. <\/p>  <p>  However, this remains a very challenging issue and I do not want to raise expectations unduly.  Immigration reform has been a divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, finding a solution for the thousands of undocumented Irish in the US remains a difficult task.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I can assure the House that the Government, its Special Envoy and our Embassy in Washington DC are continuing to give top priority to this issue, during the annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits and throughout the rest of the year, mindful of its importance to the thousands of undocumented and to their families in Ireland, and that we will spare no effort in seeking a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900087#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900087#WRD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[14548\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900087#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the consideration that was given to assisting Ireland in relation to Brexit in the St Patrick's Day ministerial visits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day provides Ireland with an unparalleled opportunity to promote our political and economic interests abroad, as well as access to key political and business contacts in leading markets around world.

These were important steps forward.<\/p><p>The European Council, in agreeing additional negotiating Guidelines on 23 March, stressed that work remains to be done in order to achieve overall agreement on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, especially with regard to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It reiterated that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  To this end, an intensive schedule of negotiations has been agreed between the EU and the UK with a view to continuing efforts to narrow the remaining gaps on the draft Protocol and its annexes, including with regard to Article 4, which addresses the free movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the EU.  The overall aim is to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union that are necessary to protect North South cooperation and the all-island economy as well as to avoid a hard border.  It will be necessary for all the EU rules involved to be listed exhaustively in annexes to the Protocol and that work is continuing. <\/p><p>The first rounds took place earlier this week and more will be held over the coming weeks.

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost over 400,000 lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta which has cost the lives of hundreds of civilians, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. <\/p>  <p>  UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254. Ireland and the EU fully support this process.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 on 24 February.  This resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access.  The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite clear that Russia&rsquo;s support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s has communicated its concerns directly to the Russian and Iranian authorities on numerous occasions.  In October 2017, I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s strong views directly to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov. I also called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  My Department&rsquo;s officials and I will continue to raise our concerns about the ongoing crisis in Syria with the Russian and Iranian authorities in our interactions with them.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.  The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April of this year at which Ireland will announce its pledge to the humanitarian effort in response to the Syria crisis in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU are providing significant assistance to refugees and refugee hosting communities.  The EU is supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country, and &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland contributing &euro;22.9 million. &euro;15 million of this has already been provided to date.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland also supporting refugee hosting communities in Lebanon and Jordan.  Ireland has already contributed &euro;9.67 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Lebanon channelled through UN and NGO partners, and &euro;5.89 million to Jordan through the Jordan Humanitarian Fund. <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has also committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region. To date, almost 2,000 people have already arrived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900088#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900088#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[14762\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900088#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to resume talks between the Irish and British Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland in relation to the need to have the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive restored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>Over the course of many months, the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, have worked tirelessly to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to form an Executive.

This includes decisions in relation to products and lending as determined by the banks.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not currently have a bespoke national regulatory regime or framework for the regulation of crowdfunding, including peer-to-peer lending, unlike some other European member states, including the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Given that crowdfunding is not currently a regulated activity in Ireland, there are no formal consumer protections available for those using crowdfunding platforms to provide funds.  The Central Bank of Ireland has issued an information notice alerting consumers to this fact.<\/p>  <p>  The crowdfunding market in Ireland is relatively small.  There are currently only three crowdfunding platforms operating in the market, all of which provide peer-to-peer lending services.  There are no equity crowdfunding platforms operating in Ireland currently. Currently, crowdfunding constitutes approximately 0.33% - 0.4% of the SME finance market; for comparison, this is 12% in the UK. <\/p>  <p>  My Department conducted a six-week public consultation process on the regulation of crowdfunding that ended in June 2017.

The applicable ceilings and rates will depend on the particular circumstances of the borrower, and are set out in section 244. Comprehensive guidance notes on mortgage interest relief can be found on the Revenue website using the following link<\/p><p><i> <\/i><\/p><p>Section 244A TCA 1997 provides that tax relief is granted at source by the lender in respect of loans secured by a mortgage on a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence.  To facilitate this process the lender is required to seek, on periodic basis, updated information from Revenue, which the lender (or their appointed service provider) uses to calculate the correct amount of tax relief due in respect of each qualifying loan. <\/p><p>The lender (or their appointed service provider) then submits a claim to Revenue in relation to the tax relief granted at source by them on all qualifying loans.  Before making any payment to the lender Revenue carries out the required verification checks to ensure the payment to the lender represents the correct amount of tax relief due on each qualifying loan.  If the lender incorrectly grants too much tax relief at source to a qualifying loan, Revenue will not reimburse the lender for any excess incorrectly granted.  Any consequential adjustment to an individual borrower&rsquo;s liability is a matter for the lender and borrower.  As a result many lenders do not show these excess payments to borrowers on their returns to Revenue but instead deal directly with the borrower in relation to them.<\/p><p>On this basis, Revenue does not have a complete record of such overpayments, as they are not overpayments on the Revenue system.  Therefore accurate information on the numbers or amounts of such overpayments for the years 2013 to 2017, and to date in 2018, cannot be provided from Revenue data.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has no role in the calculation of mortgage interest relief but has an overall supervisory role over the regulated lenders and service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900089#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":296,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 113 and 114 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900089#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[14829\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900089#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies availing of the knowledge development box; the cost of the programme in 2016; the number of SMEs that obtained the relief in 2016; the cost of these claims; the number of SMEs that were expected to claim the relief; the number of SMEs that claimed the relief; the cost of these claims; the number of SMEs that were expected to claim the relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) applies for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

In fact, as the overriding objective of the current change process is to ensure the provision of GYDP services to every child who needs them, it is likely that there will be an increased funding requirement for GYDPs in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and\u00a0improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. This improvement to the service will\u00a0have benefits for\u00a0significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services. While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.\u00a0\u00a0 I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the ongoing\u00a0consultation process. This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.

The plan encompasses the agreed recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot; and the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to expand the Garda work force.  In relation to civilian staff the Plan sets a medium term target of 20% civilians of the overall Garda workforce by 2021.  This translates to a doubling the number of civilian staff from 2,000 to 4,000 over the period.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff. In this regard the Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts that may be suitable for redeployment.<\/p><p>The 20% target is to be achieved through a twin-track approach: firstly, through a &quot;civilian by default&quot; policy  to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant, and secondly, redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. <\/p><p>Thus far the Commissioner has received sanction in accordance with the statutory framework under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for over 280 new posts to address critical skills and capacity gaps in the organisation and to backfill posts occupied by redeployed Garda&iacute;.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently engaging with the Policing Authority in relation to approval for a further 116 new civilian posts.  It is also through a workforce planning exercise identifying further priority areas that would benefit from civilian staff with specific skillset<\/p><p>To support the redeployment programme An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducted an organisation deployment survey in February 2017 which identified 2,000 roles for further examination to clarify if they could be undertaken by civilian staff.  Of those, 871 roles were identified as administrative.  The Commissioner has established a dedicated Project Team to drive momentum on redeployment.  That Team is conducted a detailed review of the survey results to identify specific roles for redeployment on a phased basis.  It is of course important to keep in mind that redeployment must be approached fairly and with regard to why the member is in an administrative role.  It may be, for example that the member is on light duties due to a medical condition or is pregnant. It may also be the case that some members may require refresher training to support them in returning to the front-line.  The Team is working to address these challenges and is engaging with the Garda Associations.<\/p><p>I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase.  Funding for a further 500 additional civilians was provided in Budget 2018.  The Government is committed to meeting the 20% target and I have made it clear to the Commissioner that I expect an acceleration this year to ensure that the target is met by 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK01000"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[14615\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for residency status; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned has had their permission to remain in the State renewed for a further one year period to 19 March 2019 .

The Government decided to utilise this opportunity to significantly broaden the scope of reform required by the judgement and \u00a0to ask the Oireachtas for permission to opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. This would bring Ireland in line with our EU partners and the standards of reception conditions for protection applicants, by placing the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is another important reform in the process undertaken by government since 2014. Opting in will provide the mechanism not only in addressing the issue of labour market access but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of the debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice &amp;amp; Equality, and in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, I outlined the proposal and rationale for opting into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU Treaties.\u00a0 I also outlined the compliance process involved with the EU Commission which they require, and which will take up to four months to complete.\u00a0 The Oireachtas approved the opt-in on 23rd  January and the following day our Ambassador delivered the formal notification to the Commission and European Council.<\/p>  <p>  Because of this timeframe, it was necessary to address the situation that would exist from the 9th  February until the opt-in process is completed. \u00a0From February 9th  protection applicants would be treated equally to all other third country nationals wishing to work here and they could apply for an employment permit under the regulations established and administered by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to accessing the employment permits regime, I used my executive power to provide an additional access for qualified applicants to engage in self-employment on terms that can be mirrored in a permanent scheme once the process of compliance with the Directive is completed with the EU Commission.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As outlined, these are interim measures until the four month EU opt-in process is complete.

They recognise that firearms dealers are entitled to be in possession of large quantities of firearms but require them to conduct business from a premises that has been constructed to a high standard. The Regulations also recognise the different categories of firearms dealers and scales the requirements depending on the quantities of ammunition and firearms being stored. For example, a time lock requirement does not apply to those dealers who deal only in small quantities of ammunition. <\/p>  <p>  This Statutory Instrument derives from the powers conferred under Sections 9(10) and (11) of the Firearms Act 1925, which were inserted by Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. Section 9(10) provides &ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Commissioner, may by regulations specify minimum standards to be complied with in relation to premises in which a firearms dealer carries on a business or proposes to do so&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 9(11) provides &ldquo;The minimum standards shall be determined by reference to<\/p>  <p>  (a) the security of the premises<\/p>  <p>  (b) their safety, and<\/p>  <p>  (c) their standard of construction, <\/p>  <p>  and having regard to their use for, as the case may be, the manufacture, repair, testing, proving or sale of firearms or ammunition&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  These provisions were passed by the Oireachtas on 5 July 2006 and signed into law by the President on 16 July 2006 and commenced on 1 January 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations were developed following consultation with a sub-group of the Firearms Consultative Panel (FCP) consisting of registered firearms dealers. It was agreed by the FCP when this sub group was being established that the firearms dealers on the Panel at the time should sit on the sub-group for the purpose of examining this particular issue. Firearms dealers&rsquo; premises were visited in fourteen counties prior to and during the drafting of this legislation. The dealers who sat on the sub-group are knowledgeable of the security that they and their colleagues utilise.  Additionally, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na who were represented on the group have extensive experience with regard to security measures available in the industry and particularly in firearms dealers&rsquo; premises. <\/p>  <p>  The FCP is a consultative group and it was never the intention that the legislation would be dependent on the FCP&rsquo;s support. I should add that I am currently reviewing the future structure and membership of the FCP and submissions have been invited from the relevant interest groups. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has endorsed the security measures contained in this Regulation and has advised that the inclusion of a requirement for a time-lock on the strong room door will deter criminal activity and require the use of greater resources by any person attempting to access firearms or ammunition illegally.  Similar security measures have been applied successfully elsewhere, e.g. in banks, pharmacies and the jewellery sector.     <\/p>  <p>  In order to minimise the financial impact, a lead-in time of twelve months (to 1 February 2019) for compliance has been included in the Regulation in order to permit dealers sufficient time to comply with the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans to amend these regulations which have been introduced as a public safety measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":541,"content":"<p>Question No. 202 answered with Question No. 183.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Training","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[14786\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900093#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of training 100 new Garda recruits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by arranging for the recruitment and training of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves last March which attracted 2,394 applicants, of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first class will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the attached table the number of Garda Reserves by Division as of 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available.<\/p><p>Garda Reserve Strength 28 February 2018<table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DMR South Central<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR North Central<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR North<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR East<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR South<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR West<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny\/Carlow<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork West<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan\/Monaghan<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo\/Leitrim<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon\/Longford<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois\/Offaly<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>569<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL00700"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[14795\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the timeline for recruitment of garda&iacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<b><\/b><\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Cavan\/Monaghan Division on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 329 of whom 2 are designated as full-time Community Garda. There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 38 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p><p>In relation to the number of &ldquo;Community Garda&iacute;&rdquo; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a &ldquo;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 53 to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division, 13 of whom were allocated from the last attestation on the 16 March 2018. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also a further 600 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the remainder of the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[14808\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if all outstanding documentation has been furnished by a person (details supplied); if their case for naturalisation and long-term residency will now be processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned applied for renewal for a right of residency, accompanied by a right to work, based on their parentage of an Irish citizen child.

For any such further processing (including disclosure, sharing or otherwise making the data available) to be lawful, a legal basis, such as the consent of the individuals to whom the date relate, is required. This &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo; principle is also set out in\u00a0Article 5.1(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will enter into force across the EU on 25 May. It means that an appropriate legal basis will continue to be required for the purposes of such further processing.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While supervision and enforcement of data protection law in the State, including the handling of complaints, is currently a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner, Part 2 of the Data Protection Bill 2018, which yesterday completed its passage through the Seanad, provides for establishment of a Data Protection Commission to supervise and enforce the strengthened data subject rights in the GDPR. The Commissioner\u00a0performs her statutory\u00a0tasks and exercises\u00a0her powers in an independent manner; the same will apply to the Commission following its establishment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following\u00a0entry into force of the GDPR, the Commission will\u00a0be responsible for administering a broad range of sanctions in cases in which the data protection standards\u00a0of the GDPR have been breached. These include the possible imposition of administrative fines of up to &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million (or 2% or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year). I am confident that establishment of the Data Protection Commission, together with the availability of strengthened sanctions, will facilitate effective supervision and enforcement of the GDPR&rsquo;s enhanced data protection standards. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the digital age of consent, the position is that while Article 8 of the GDPR provides for an age of 16 years, it clearly states that Member States may provide for a lower age but no lower than 13 years. The age of 16 years is not an EU recommendation,\u00a0but rather the upper age limit and Member States have adopted different approaches to implementing this provision. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist the Government in making its decision on the digital age of consent to apply in this jurisdiction\u00a0both my Department and the Government&rsquo;s Data Forum &ndash; which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives from SMEs and multinationals, as well as sociologists, psychologists and education specialists &ndash; carried out public consultation processes.\u00a0 Following the completion of these consultation processes, the Government opted for a digital age of consent of 13 years.\u00a0When making this decision, the Government took account of the expertise and knowledge of those that responded to these consultation processes in reaching this decision. A majority of respondents &ndash; including, notably, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, the Internet Safety Advisory Committee and the Children's Rights Alliance &ndash; recommended a &lsquo;digital age of consent&rsquo; of 13 years. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, when appearing before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality for the pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Data Protection Bill last July, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr Geoffrey Shannon, also recommended setting the &lsquo;digital age of consent&rsquo; at 13 years. This recommendation was adopted by the Joint Committee in their report published in November last. <\/p>  <p>  I should add, finally, that a number of other Member States, including Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, UK and Spain, have also adopted a digital age of consent of 13 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900094#WRL05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reports","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900095#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[14898\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900095#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 294 of 23 January 2018, 90 and 95 of 25 January 2018, and 223 of 20 February 2018, when the promised reports from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be issued;

Wicklow.  Under the deal, Olcott has acquired the full share capital of Ardmore Studios International.  Prior to the sale of Ardmore Studios, it was owned 68.33% by private interests and 31.67% by the State. The State&rsquo;s shareholding is managed by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland inherited the stake from NADCORP, the former State investment agency, in 1986. As a passive investor, Enterprise Ireland had no enterprise development role in Ardmore or any involvement in its day-to-day operations.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of the Ardmore Studios was a commercial decision by the majority owners of the studios. <\/p>  <p>  Wicklow County Council has in the past confirmed to my Department that it agrees to maintain the film-only zoning as a matter of policy.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland negotiated the sale of its shareholding with the benefit of due diligence undertaken by independent consultants and are satisfied that they realised full market value, and on a par with the other parties.  As the sale is a commercial transaction relating to a private company, the terms cannot be revealed for reasons of business confidentiality.<\/p>  <p>  Investment is required in the Ardmore studios' facilities to secure its long term commercial future and the Olcott Entertainment deal provides the potential to breathe new life into the company at a time when the market for film production in Ireland is again showing good growth potential.<\/p>  <p>  I therefore welcome the Olcott plans to develop and expand the Ardmore Studio offering, and other related entertainment projects which I believe is in the best commercial interests of the studios, the skilled workers in the area, and in Ireland as a location for international film production.  Olcott also intends to retain the current experienced Ardmore management and staff.<\/p>  <p>  I have not met with representatives of the purchasers.

These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill. In this situation, I and my predecessors have had to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposals were progressing through the European Union legislative process.

These efforts include extensive contingency planning at a domestic level and influencing the EU approach to the negotiations with the UK. In order to provide an evidence base to inform our approach to our domestic response, and to the negotiations, my Department has led and\/or been involved in a broad range of research and analysis. One such study was that commissioned from the ESRI by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commissions (CCPC): this study was designed to provide us with evidence of the potential impacts of particular Brexit scenarios on consumers in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The research examined two Brexit scenarios on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis. The first, where there is a trade deal and tariffs are avoided, but where there still could be significant non-tariff barriers such as costs arising from additional time spent at customs, or due to changes in labelling rules and other regulatory standards. The second, a &ldquo;harder&rdquo; scenario with the imposition of World Trade Organisation tariffs in addition to non-tariff barriers.<\/p>  <p>  Depending on the scenario, the analysis finds an increase in the cost of living of between &euro;892 and &euro;1,360 per year for the average household. The increases would be unevenly distributed across households, with lower income households most affected by price rises. <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC has brought the report&rsquo;s findings to the attention of the relevant enterprise agencies (and other stakeholders) with a view to their consideration of potential future actions. However, it is important to recall that the actual impact will depend not only on the eventual Brexit deal reached, but also on the level of domestic competition, the availability of alternatives to particular products and consumers&rsquo; responses to changes in prices.<\/p>  <p>  Government has, of course, already put a whole host of policy and operational measures in place to respond to Brexit including supporting and encouraging companies, including retailers, to plan for Brexit now. A key tool which is available to all companies is the SME Brexit Scorecard which is online and free to access. It is a diagnostic tool which points to areas companies could consider in starting to prepare a Brexit plan. These include operational issues like reviewing sourcing, supply chains, transport and logistics more generally as well as more strategic issues such as lean initiatives, diversification and investing in innovation.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting companies to prepare for Brexit can also ultimately help to protect consumers from possible negative impacts of Brexit as companies make alternative sourcing arrangements to underpin security of supply and cut costs to keep prices for consumers down. The CCPC study points to some opportunities presented by Brexit for domestic business particularly in the area of import substitution. Although the study points to the potential for considerable increased costs arising for consumers as well as the possibility of reduced product choice, it also points to the fact that actions by business and consumer behaviour can help mitigate the actual impact which will also be dependent on the level of domestic competition in various sectors, the availability of alternatives and the willingness of consumers to move away from certain products.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 and Enterprise 2025, neither contain specific consumer related actions as they are primarily focused on job creation and improving the business environment.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most effective mitigation actions we can take in responding to Brexit is to negotiate the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK. The Government has been seized of that since the negotiations started and will continue to remain central in shaping the EU approach to the negotiations with the UK with a view to getting the best deal, minimising risks and maximising opportunities associated with Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900095#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Data","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900095#WRM04500"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[14911\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900095#WRM04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide an overview of the revised research priority areas in each of the years 2018 to 2023; the details of each revised action committed to in tabular form; the deadline for this action to be completed; and the budget funding to be made available to priority areas.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, committed to refreshing and revising the priority areas which were introduced under Research Prioritisation in 2012 to ensure that they are still valid in light of changed circumstances.<\/p><p>A rigorous exercise including extensive consultation was undertaken to develop the evidence base to inform the refresh exercise.\u00a0While the evidence demonstrated that for many of the priority areas, the focus remains as relevant in 2018 as it was for the 2012 -2017 cycle, there have been several revisions and updates to both the themes and the priority areas to reflect changing circumstances in that period.<\/p><p>- The ICT priority areas have been broadened to reflect the changes in technology since 2012 and now include Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (including Machine Learning), Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.<\/p><p>- With the focus on preventive health measures and the increasing emphasis on well-being, which is evident across all the health-related priority areas, the Health theme has been evolved to reflect these drivers and is renamed Health and Well-being.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Sustainable Food Production and Processing priority area is broadened to reflect the evolution in technology since 2012 and the key emerging priorities in the EU initiative Food 2030, particularly the need for climate smart and environmentally sustainable food systems and the need for circularity and resources efficiency of food systems and is renamed Smart and Sustainable Food Production and Processing.<b><\/b><\/p><p>- The most significant changes have been to the Energy theme.

This Agreement has a particular focus on addressing recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery posts. This Agreement followed an agreement with the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU in summer 2016 that also includes a range of measures aimed at improving psychiatric nursing staffing levels.

It is important that every sector plays its part given Ireland&rsquo;s very challenging 2020 and, provisionally agreed ,2030 targets. We must look to 2030 and beyond in formulating policies that will address the twin challenges of climate change and the global increase in demand for food.  It is projected that there will be a 50% increase in global demand for food by as early as 2030.  The IPCC 5th assessment report highlighted that globally, food sources will become unpredictable, as population booms. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is more important than ever that we continue to produce food, especially as our agri-food production system has been independently and internationally recognised as both climate and resource efficient. Our grass-fed, low carbon model of livestock production places us at an advantage versus other livestock producing nations and with the right approach to sustainable agri-food and the right mitigation techniques, we can approach our responsibilities to climate change in a very positive and effective way. <\/p>  <p>  At national level we are taking a whole of Government approach to climate policy.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, which is the lead department in this area. <\/p>  <p>  We have used this collaborative approach to make the most of opportunities such as actively   following the IPCC in relation to the development of their Special Report on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supported the concept of a Special Report by hosting a preliminary workshop in 2015 and subsequently Ireland along with Costa Rica, New Zealand and Tanzania sent a letter to the IPCC proposing that a Special Report on Climate Change, Food and Agriculture be undertaken. The IPCC formally considered this and other various proposals for special reports as part of the 6th assessment cycle which will culminate in a 6th assessment report in time for the first global stock take in 2023. Following difficult discussions the IPCC agreed to produce three Special Reports one of which is on land\/agriculture issues (Climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems&rsquo;).<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 Ireland again hosted the IPCC at which the  terms of reference for the Special Report were agreed.  This Special Report will be developed under the joint scientific leadership of Working Groups I, II and III supported by the WG III TSU (Technical Support Unit).

Rather, national ceilings are set out in the relevant EU Regulations, and the Department manages the expenditure on all Pillar 1 schemes with reference to these ceilings.  The relevant ceilings as set out in the EU Regulations are as follows:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ceiling<\/td><td>&euro;1,216m<\/td><td>&euro;1,215m<\/td><td>&euro;1,214m<\/td><td>&euro;1,212m<\/td><td>&euro;1,212m<\/td><td>&euro;1,211m<\/td><td>&euro;1,211m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In managing Pillar 1 expenditure with reference to these ceilings, regular reports are compiled and submitted to the EU Commission.  This reporting then underpins the drawdown of EU funds to match Pillar 1 expenditure already undertaken.  Expenditure figures are collated in a number of different ways in order to fulfil the regulatory reporting requirements &ndash; for example, scheme year expenditure is tracked along with expenditure in a given calendar year.  Across these levels of expenditure tracking there are also set EU rules for how expenditure is counted against the ceilings &ndash; for example, expenditure in respect of a given scheme year which is paid out in a different calendar year may in certain circumstances be required to be reported against both the calendar and scheme year ceiling.<\/p><p>Bearing these regulatory reporting requirements in mind, the following table sets out the number of farmers and the amount paid out to date in respect of each scheme year:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Payments to farmers<\/td><td>&euro;1,170m<\/td><td>&euro;1,194m<\/td><td>&euro;1,188m<\/td><td>&euro;1,168m<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Number paid<\/td><td>121,985<\/td><td>126,923<\/td><td>124,517<\/td><td>123,073<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>These figures represent the amounts paid out under BPS, the Young Farmer Scheme, the National Reserve, Greening, and the Protein Aid Scheme.  The figures are net of penalties and overpayments which may apply in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>In order to manage expenditure with reference to the ceilings, there are a number of other factors to be also taken into account.  For example, in respect of the 2014 figure modulation is not included in these figures.  <\/p><p>Also, the figures in respect of the reimbursement of the Financial Discipline are not included in the above table.  Each year, a proportion of the Pillar 1 funds is withheld centrally at EU level to cater for any events which may give rise to the need to allocate money from the &ldquo;Crisis Reserve&rdquo; fund which this withheld money creates.  If this reserve is not utilised, it is redistributed to individual Member States at a later date.  For example, in June 2017 my Department made payments totalling &euro;13.6m to 96,000 farmers who were eligible under the 2016 BPS.  This money had previously been withheld at EU level from the 2015 BPS payments under the Financial Discipline rules.  The payment of this Financial Discipline across scheme and calendar years also has to be taken into account in managing the expenditure with reference to the national ceilings.<\/p><p>For each annual ceiling, there will also be cases that fall to be paid outside the bulk of the payment runs made in the October to December period in each year.  For example, particularly protracted legal cases, cases where errors remain to be rectified, and appeal cases will fall to be paid in later years.  These cases also require to be taken into account in the management of the ceilings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Livestock Issues","counter":844,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[14840\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 551 and 553 of 14 December 2017, if all the data requested been compiled.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.\u00a0 The livestock unit data in each case is based on cattle and sheep data held by my Department.<\/p><p>Table 1 - Livestock units per hectare and BPS value per hectare<table><tr><th>Range of average BPS value per hectare\u00a0 - &euro;<\/th><th>Livestock Unit per hectare<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0-100<\/td><td>0.75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>100-200<\/td><td>1.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>200-300<\/td><td>1.60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>300-400<\/td><td>1.78<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>400-500<\/td><td>1.70<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>500-600<\/td><td>1.71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>600-700<\/td><td>1.62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>700-800<\/td><td>1.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>800-900<\/td><td>1.27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>900-1000<\/td><td>1.28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;1000<\/td><td>1.18<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Table 2 - Livestock units per hectare and category of land (ANC scheme)<table><tr><th>ANC category<\/th><th>Livestock unit per hectare<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Island<\/td><td>0.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less Severe<\/td><td>1.40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>More Severe<\/td><td>1.11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountain land<\/td><td>0.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Non ANC<\/td><td>1.31<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme","counter":847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":848,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[14841\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a review of the rural development programme, RDP, targets, both participation and expenditure levels, committed to originally has commenced in view of the passing of the motion supporting the suckler sector on 21 February 2018 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann;

Over the last ten years 210 people have been killed on Irish farms.  23 of these were children and 74 were elderly people.  Accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  Last year there were 24 fatal accidents on farms accounting for over 50% of all workplace fatalities.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly there have already been 4 fatal farm accidents this year.  Each of these deaths is a tragedy and we must work together to reduce deaths and accidents on our farms.  Every single farmer must make time and take responsibility for safety on their farm to ensure they and their families and employees are working in as safe an environment as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Farm Safety Interdepartmental Task Force was set up to focus on this important area and my Department is a participant.  My Department highlighted its on-going efforts under Ireland&rsquo;s current Rural Development Programme, including:<\/p>  <p>  - A Farm Safety Scheme that was opened as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) round of on-farm investment schemes.<\/p>  <p>  - As part of all the TAMS II strands, it is mandatory to have completed a minimum of a &frac12; day farm safety course on completing the Code of Practice within the last five years.<\/p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines are included in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by my Department for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures.  The guidelines give advice on best practice and legislation.<\/p>  <p>  - A mandatory Health and Safety element is included in all Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups under the 2014-2020 RDP.  All KT Groups held a meeting on the theme of farm health and safety in Year One of the Programme. Farmer participants also complete, for each of the three years of the Programme, a tailored Farm Improvement Plan with their approved KT Facilitator which includes a component related to farm health and safety.  In addition to attending group meetings farmers have the option to attend an approved Knowledge Transfer National Event such as a farm walk in lieu of two meetings.  Since the commencement of the Programme 11 of these events have addressed the topic of farm health and safety.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, training on farm health and safety was delivered to approximately 300 KT Facilitators under the Continuous Professional Development measure.<\/p>  <p>  The group is reviewing stakeholder submissions and considering further opportunities for interventions in what is a critical challenge for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the future of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post 2020, the recent public consultation process organised by my Department allowed for views and possible approaches to be discussed and coincided with an invitation to make written submissions on the future of the CAP.  Any measure that can reduce farm fatality rates will be given utmost consideration when finalising Ireland&rsquo;s position during future discussions of the CAP post 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[14853\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900099#WRQ02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the recent publication by the European Commission on its multi-annual plan for fish stocks in the western waters which are located within the Atlantic Ocean.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>The EU Commission published on 23 March 2018 a proposal establishing a multiannual plan for fish stocks in the Western Waters and adjacent waters, and for fisheries exploiting those stocks.

Of course, we remain vigilant in monitoring the market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of intervention stocks overhanging the dairy market remains a cause for concern arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder across the EU since September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Figures from the European Commission show there were approximately 376,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in public intervention stocks at the end of February effectively overhanging the EU skimmed milk powder market. <\/p>  <p>  With specific regard to the tonnes of skimmed milk powder purchased into intervention, no quantities have been purchased since October 2017 as detailed in the most recent Milk Market Observatory Report published by the European Commission 23\/03\/2018. A total of 30,647 tonnes were offered to intervention in 2017, this is in addition to 334,551 tonnes offered in 2016 and 40,280 offered in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the sale of intervention stocks, the Commission has agreed to accept bids as part of its most recent tender process, for approximately 4,127 tonnes of SMP at a price of &euro;105\/100kg. A further 4337 tonnes were sold at a price of &euro;110\/100kg in February 2018 and a total of 1564 tonnes at a price of &euro;119\/100kg in January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the price offered by the Commission as referred to and the Commission&rsquo;s approach to this generally, my Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to limit further stockpiling of skimmed milk powder in 2018 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed-price ceiling to zero.  I strongly argued that this measure should be specified as for 2018 only to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term.  This point was accepted and agreed in the final version of the measure as adopted by the Council through Regulation No. (EU) 2018\/147 of 29 January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of Ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative that the Commission remains vigilant in monitoring the market and that it has contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging in relevant markets, particularly the raw milk, butter and skimmed milk powder markets.  In common with the vast majority of EU member states where dairy production is of significance, I recognised that the current position on existing stocks could not be allowed to persist indefinitely and that there is general acceptance that doing nothing is not an option.<\/p>  <p>  Given the Commission's status among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the skimmed milk powder market, and as such its capacity to affect market sentiment, the Commission should act prudently and responsibly in the disposal of stocks.

Both documents have a shared set of National Strategic Outcomes, including addressing Ireland's transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.

With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, in December 2017, the European Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement on a target of a 30% reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018. This proposal follows extensive negotiations, during which Ireland emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State with the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner. <\/p>  <p>  The latest Environmental Protection Agency report on greenhouse gas emissions projections, published April 2017, indicates that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual limits from 2017 onwards, and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020. The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  Considering this, Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target will present a very significant challenge, the scale and complexity of which is not underestimated by this Government. As a means to addressing the climate challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017. It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective. However, it has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectorial mitigation options.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent list of measures currently in place in the context of the National Mitigation Plan is set out in the 2017 Annual Transition Statement, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 December last. This Statement details the key measures in place in the respective sectors, the objective for each measure, estimated mitigation potential and funding information, where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>Building on the approach set out in the National Mitigation Plan, the recently\u00a0launched Project Ireland 2040 reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland\u00a0to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. As part of Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework will guide national development and prioritised investment over the next two decades.\u00a0  Implementation of the National Planning Framework at a local and regional level will take place in the context of, inter alia, new Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, development plans and local authority statutory planning processes. The Framework does not, therefore, address specific provisions in relation to climate change for individual towns or local authority areas. <\/p>  <p>  Under the new National Development Plan, Exchequer funding of &euro;7.6 billion, together with investment of &euro;14.2 billion by commercial State bodies will ensure a step change in strategic climate\u00a0action investments. This means that almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5 to be spent in the framework of the National Development Plan over the next decade will be on climate action, with a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, the built environment, and flood risk management, to address the significant climate change challenges that Ireland faces. Furthermore, a new Climate Action Fund,\u00a0with an allocation of &euro;500m, has been designed to leverage additional investment by public and private entities in climate action measures.<\/p>  <p>  During the period of the Plan, key capital investments to be overseen by my Department will comprise some:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;3.8 billion on upgrading the energy efficiency rating\u00a0to achieve a minimum of BER Rating B in the\u00a0existing residential,\u00a0commercial and public building stock.\u00a0Coupled with this, new buildings will be regulated to the highest standards and the roll-out of digital connectivity will facilitate &ldquo;smart buildings&rdquo;;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;1 billion on rolling out energy-efficient heating technologies under the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat aimed at large heat users, along with support for heat pumps and roof solar in at least 170,000 homes; <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;0.2 billion to incentivise the uptake of 500,000 electric vehicles by 2030, and provide additional charging infrastructure.\u00a0 Related support measures include a ban on new non-zero emission cars being sold in Ireland after 2030 and no NCT certificate for non-zero emission cars after 2045<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;0.1 billion on energy research funding to accelerate diversification away from fossil fuels to green energy. <\/p>  <p>  This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant upscaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan. This will be essential in order to meet Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 targets, as well as to make significant progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s National Transition Objective for 2050 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) and, in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900100#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900100#WRR01900"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[14563\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900100#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount that his Department has spent on social media training and consultancy in each year since 2016.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":916,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department\u00a0did\u00a0not incur\u00a0any expenditure\u00a0on\u00a0social media training or social media consultancy in\u00a02016 or\u00a02017.

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre. Those two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. This substantial multi-annual envelope includes funding of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to fundamentally transform our bus system and to address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The recently launched National Development Plan also identifies the BusConnects programme as a key public transport investment priority for completion in the GDA over the period of the plan. <\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is complete, the NTA will launch public consultations that are expected to commence in April and May of this year. The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors routes and bus acquisition. The costs of the various elements of the overall BusConnects programme will be confirmed as part of the appropriate appraisal and procurement processes required under the Public Spending Code.<\/p>  <p>  Noting the responsibility of the NTA in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for a more detailed reply.

As outlined in the recently published 'National Development Plan 2018-2027: Project Ireland 2040' (NDP), the DART Expansion Programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART Network? for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected over the period of the plan.  <\/p>  <p>  A business case - including a cost benefit analysis - was carried out on the DART Expansion Programme in 2015 by Aecom consultants for the NTA. The business case is available on the NTA website.  A key element  of the economic appraisal was a cost benefit analysis the results of which indicated a strong economic case for the DART Expansion Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The initial sequencing of investment under the NDP will focus on delivery of non-underground tunnel elements of the Programme using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park (which has provided the option for Kildare commuters to access the city centre stations of Connolly, Tara Street and Pearse).  This sequencing and focus includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as re-signalling, junction and station changes to provide expanded services.  The next step will be to provide fast, high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Line, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth\/Sligo Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  It will also include new stations to provide interchange with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.<\/p>  <p>  The significant benefit to using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park and the proposed sequence of investment, is that it will enable additional passenger services to be put in place much earlier using existing infrastructure with some enhancements.  This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Maynooth and Celbridge\/Hazelhatch as well as Drogheda and Greystones.  The route for the remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme, the DART Underground Tunnel, will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.

It is not possible to determine a person&rsquo;s pension entitlement until a pension application is received in the Department from the individual, and their social insurance record is examined by a Deciding Officer. <\/p>  <p>  My Department identifies customers who appear to have an entitlement to state pension (contributory), in advance of reaching pension age (currently 66 years of age), to invite them to make a timely application for pension.  This customer service initiative is aimed at helping approx. 14,000 applicants annually to receive their pension entitlement by the due date (currently their 66th birthday) and minimise late applications for pension.   <\/p>  <p>  Applicants, who according to the social insurance records held by the Department appear to satisfy the minimum eligibility conditions for state pension (contributory), are invited to apply.  Determining details include the applicant&rsquo;s name and address, (verified) dates of birth\/death, date of entry into insurance and evidence of recent interaction with the Department.  If the commercial partnership has been decided upon in advance of the customer&rsquo;s 66th birthday, they may be included in this invitation process.  Social Welfare legislation stipulates that the onus is still on the customer to apply.  On receipt of a completed application, the person&rsquo;s entitlement to state pension (contributory) is examined by a Deciding Officer and the person is notified of the outcome. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of Directive 2010\/41\/EU is to lay down a framework for Member States to put into effect the principle of equal treatment between men and women who are engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity or who are contributing to the pursuit of such an activity.  <\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Directive relevant to Social Welfare (Articles 7 and 8) require the provision of social protection benefits including maternity benefit, to spouses\/civil partners who are not employees or business partners but who participate in the activities of their self-employed spouse\/civil partner performing the same tasks or ancillary tasks.  <\/p>  <p>  The requirements of this Directive, other than articles 7 and 8, have been catered for in existing national legislation, e.g. the Employment Equality Act 2000, Equal Status Act 2000, Maternity Protection Act 1994 (as amended).  No specific amendments were required to the existing provisions of these Acts in order to comply with the requirements of the Directive in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current eligibility criteria, a person must have started paying social insurance before their 56th birthday and must have paid 10 years (520 paid contributions) in order to qualify for a contributory State pension. If Class S contributions only commenced on foot of this Directive a person will not qualify for a State pension until 2024 at the earliest. The Department only has information on whether a Class S contribution was paid on an earned or unearned basis and cannot analyse contributions by sector or nature of work.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of social insurance to these spouses\/civil partners means that they will be liable to pay PRSI contributions on their annual self-employed income provided it exceeds an annual insurability threshold of &euro;5,000.  The payment of these contributions will entitle these spouses\/civil partners to access social insurance benefits currently available to other self-employed workers.  The principal social insurance benefits to which self-employed workers can establish entitlement are widows, widowers or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension, State pension contributory, maternity benefit, invalidity pension and treatment benefit which are required under the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The current system of social insurance operates on a mandatory basis only and does not provide for voluntary participation on the part of the contributors.  Self-employed persons who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;500.  The extension of social insurance to assisting spouses\/civil partners can therefore only be on a mandatory basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Allowing participation on a voluntary basis could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that these provisions apply to spouse\/civil partners who had previously been excluded from social insurance and apply regardless of the sector in which they operate. It therefore applies to all sectors of the economy, based on the circumstances of each individual &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900103#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900103#WRU02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[14567\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900103#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the amount that her Department has spent on social media training and consultancy in each year since 2016.","asker":"1274","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>Details of social media training commissioned by the Department in each year since 2016 are set out in the following table.

The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p><p>The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p><p>As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p><p>The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p><p>As outlined in the table below the cost of introducing jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;45 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;60 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;81 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;185 million in 2071.<\/p><p>The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Illness, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer's Benefit<\/th><th>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Illness, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer's Benefit<\/th><th>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Illness, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer's Benefit<\/th><th>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Illness, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer's Benefit<\/th><th>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Illness, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer's Benefit<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Invalidity<\/td><td>Illness<\/td><td>Jobseeker's<\/td><td>Carer's<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 (act)<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>118<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>173<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2020<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>72<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>223<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2021<\/td><td>125<\/td><td>88<\/td><td>63<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>281<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2022<\/td><td>152<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>67<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>317<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2023<\/td><td>176<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>71<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>351<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2024<\/td><td>198<\/td><td>104<\/td><td>75<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>382<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2025<\/td><td>218<\/td><td>108<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>413<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2030<\/td><td>338<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>579<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2035<\/td><td>429<\/td><td>172<\/td><td>103<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>714<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2040<\/td><td>496<\/td><td>198<\/td><td>112<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>817<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2045<\/td><td>551<\/td><td>222<\/td><td>123<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>910<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2050<\/td><td>537<\/td><td>223<\/td><td>125<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>899<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2055<\/td><td>563<\/td><td>237<\/td><td>134<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>950<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2060<\/td><td>601<\/td><td>256<\/td><td>144<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>1,018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2065<\/td><td>665<\/td><td>282<\/td><td>158<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1,124<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2070<\/td><td>775<\/td><td>322<\/td><td>179<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>1,297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2071<\/td><td>800<\/td><td>331<\/td><td>185<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>1,337<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Additional Projected expenditure (&euro; millions) on various benefit types where extended to class S (Actuarial Review as at 31\/12\/15)<\/p><p>The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.   This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. <\/p>  <p>   However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been a number of Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of over &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. <\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900104#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant","counter":1129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900104#WRV01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1130,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[14738\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900104#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of reinstating the bereavement grant at a rate of &euro;850; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1131,"content":"<p>During the economic downturn, my Department protected primary social welfare rates and in recent years, as the economy recovered, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners.  Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2019, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 30,008, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 30,008 such grants made in 2019, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;25.51 million.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.

Of these, some 29.49 million households (17.3% of the total) were jobless - that is, no adult in the household was working.<\/p>  <p>  For Ireland, the total number of relevant households was 1,440,600, and of these some 253,000 (17.6% of the total) were jobless.<\/p>  <p>  Although the figure for Ireland has fallen from a high of 23% in 2012 as a result of the economic recovery, government remains concerned about aspects of household joblessness that go beyond the standard measures of unemployment and receipt of jobseekers&rsquo; payments. Relevant groups, not normally considered to be unemployed, include economically inactive lone parents, people with disabilities, and the adult dependants of unemployed people, all of whom might benefit from closer attachment to employment and the labour market.  A range of policy reforms has been taken affecting these groups, and further reforms were considered in consultation with representative bodies for those involved.  These policy developments are set out in the Pathways to Work Action Plan for Jobless Households which I published on 25, September 2017.  Development of the Action Plan fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the overall Pathways to Work 2016-2020   strategy.  It also responds to concerns about the level of household joblessness raised in Country-Specific Recommendations to Ireland by the EU. <\/p>  <p>The Action Plan for Jobless Households is an example of one of the many measures that Government is implementing, with a view to assisting people and families to become work ready and gain employment.  The Plan aims to extend activation services to people who are not working, but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures. It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children &ndash; both the traditional &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; family and the lone parent family.  A number of key policy initiatives to achieve that goal are identified as follows:<\/p>  <p>- Extend active engagement   with the Intreo employment service to additional groups of economically inactive working age adults<\/p>  <p>- Improve incentives and remove barriers   for people transitioning from welfare to employment <\/p>  <p>- Pilot a family focused case management approach   in five geographical areas to improve employment rates and reduce joblessness in households across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>Progress against each of the reform actions and milestones will be monitored and reported on quarterly to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and Jobs. Implementation of these policy measures should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.  These targets are in addition to the existing Pathways to Work   targets 2020 &ndash; bringing unemployment down to between 5% and 6%, bringing long-term unemployment below 2.5%, and bringing youth unemployment below 12%.  <\/p>  <p>The Action Plan for Jobless Households   aims to identify and remove barriers that are currently preventing people from getting a fair chance, thus building a Republic of Opportunity for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900104#WRV04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Investment Incentive Scheme Data","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1161,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[14751\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons that have been subject to sanctions for non-compliance or non-engagement with her Department in each of the years 2011 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1162,"content":"<p>Penalty rates were introduced as a means of encouraging jobseekers to engage with activation measures and co-operate with efforts of the Department to assist them in securing employment.

Meeting this target means lifting almost 95,000 children out of poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the BOBF Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments, is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  2015 saw the first reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty since 2008.  Compared to 2014, in 2015 there was a 13,000 decrease, or approximately 9 per cent, in the number of children in consistent poverty.  This downward trend continued in 2016.  The full impact of the economic recovery is not yet reflected in these figures. The monthly unemployment rate in January 2018 announced by the CSO was 6.1%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2017 and 2018 become available.    The Government continues to focus on activation, to help people back into the workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  To give some perspective and a sense of the size of the challenge Ireland faces in trying to achieve the child poverty target: at the height of the economic boom in 2008, when the consistent poverty rate for children was its lowest, there were 68,000 children in consistent poverty.  So, in order to meet the target, Ireland will have to be more than twice as effective as our best ever performance to date.<\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers.  In 2016 Social transfers reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 40.5 per cent to 18.9 per cent, a poverty reduction effect of 53.3 per cent<\/p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health and childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Data","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[14753\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of social welfare appeals lodged in each of the years 2012 to 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form; the percentage of appeals which were successful; the average waiting time in these years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1168,"content":"<p>The following tables provide the details which have been requested by the Deputy for the years 2012 to 2017 and to the end of February 2018. <\/p><p>The figures provided in the tables for appeals which had a favourable outcome for the appellant relate to appeals which were either allowed in full or in part by an Appeals Officer, or which were resolved by way of a revised decision in favour of the appellant by a Deciding Officer\/Designated Person.  <\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  <\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect. It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in 37.1 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016 , 37.6 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2017 and 39.8% of favourable appeals to date in 2018.<\/p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including the time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the system impacts on appeal processing times which are proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which often require a high level of judgement, in addition to the need to ensure due process and natural justice. <\/p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  <\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first two months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Receipts and Percentage of Favourable Decisions of Appeals Finalised  2012 &ndash; 2018<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Appeal Receipts<\/th><th>Appeals <br \/><br \/>Finalised<\/th><th>Favourable Decisions<\/th><th>Appeals Disallowed<\/th><th>Withdrawn<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>35,484<\/td><td>32,558<\/td><td>50.4%<\/td><td>42.6%<\/td><td>7.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>32,777<\/td><td>38,421<\/td><td>55.0%<\/td><td>39.0%<\/td><td>6.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>26,069<\/td><td>31,211<\/td><td>56.5%<\/td><td>37.7%<\/td><td>5.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>24,475<\/td><td>25,406<\/td><td>58.8%<\/td><td>36.1%<\/td><td>5.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>22,461<\/td><td>23,220<\/td><td>59.2%<\/td><td>35.9%<\/td><td>4.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>19,658<\/td><td>18,980<\/td><td>60.1%<\/td><td>33.9%<\/td><td>6.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018 <br \/><br \/>(to 28\/2\/2018)<\/td><td>3,272<\/td><td>2,910<\/td><td>57.9%<\/td><td>37.0%<\/td><td>5.1%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times 2012&ndash; 2018<\/b><b><font color=\"#104160\"> <\/font><\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing <br \/><br \/>times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>27.8<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>33.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>21.1<\/td><td>28.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>18.1<\/td><td>25.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><td>24.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>19.8<\/td><td>26.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018 (to 28 February 2018)<\/td><td>25.2<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poverty Data","counter":1169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1170,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[14754\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the target for poverty here; the likelihood of the target being reached within the set timeframe; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1171,"content":"<p>The national social target for poverty reduction agreed by Government in 2012 is to reduce consistent poverty from 6.3% in 2010 to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  This was an ambitious target, particularly during a time of economic recession, but one to which the Government has remained committed.<\/p>  <p>  Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) indicate that consistent poverty rose sharply after 2010, to a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  The latest SILC 2016 data, released by the CSO in December 2017, indicate that this had reduced to 8.3%.  A reduction of 6 percentage points would now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of the recovery is not yet fully reflected in these most recent data, which reflect income conditions in 2015-2016.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6% in February 2018.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports including &euro;5 per week increases in the maximum weekly rate for working-age people and young jobseekers and for pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependents and an increase of &euro;2 per child per week for qualified child dependents.

Recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2018 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;74.1 million on the farm assist scheme.    <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 fully reversed the previous cuts to the Farm Assist means test.  The changes included that 70% of farm income is now assessed as means, down from 100% being assessed as means (which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard) and an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.    <\/p>  <p>  The farm assist means test is flexible so as to allow for significant income fluctuations from one year to the next.  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, and then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded - with the balance being assessed as means. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of changing the farm assist means testing rules in order that irrespective of the source of income the first &euro;3,000 would be disregarded and the balance would be means tested at 50% is approximately &euro;15 million for a full year.   This estimate is based on the existing number of recipients and current rates.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is envisaged that there would be an inflow of new farm assist claims if these measures were introduced.   The Department cannot quantify the numbers involved and as such cannot calculate the associated additional costs.  Therefore, the estimated cost of &euro;15 million should be regarded as a minimum estimate.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided for a &euro;5 per week increase in rate of payment for farm assist and the maximum rate increased from &euro;193 to &euro;198 per week from 26 March 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to means assessment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme","counter":1190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[14848\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of a proposal (details supplied) over a calendar year.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[14849\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900105#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the rationale for imposing a six year limit for some participants on the RSS; and her plans to abolish same in view of social and community value of this scheme.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 441 and 442 together.<\/p><p>The rural social scheme (RSS) provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen\/women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities<\/p><p>Since 1st February 2017, all participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme also applies. It should be noted that almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years.  As a result, opportunities for new people to go on the scheme are very limited.  It is in this context that a maximum six year participation limit on the scheme was introduced for participants commencing on or after 1st February 2017. The six year limit will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available.  In addition income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist.  <\/p><p>The deputy should be aware that RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  This includes having an entitlement to one of the qualifying social welfare payments and maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm\/Fish Assist.  <\/p><p>There are currently no plans to change the eligibility conditions for persons over 55 years of age who commenced since 1<sup>st<\/sup>February 2017. Records available indicate that there are 206 RSS participants over 55 years who commenced on RSS since 1<sup>st<\/sup>February 2017. <\/p><p>It is estimated that the full year cost of an RSS place is &euro;16,500 while the net cost is estimated at &euro;6,000. This costing consists of wages paid to participants, fuel allowance, supervisory costs, fees to implementing bodies, fees to the payroll provider and provision of input costs for implementing bodies.  <\/p><p>I would like to reiterate that the Government strongly supports the work being done through the RSS and the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country.

Increased delivery of homes at more affordable prices will involve local authorities developing their own residential land bank, comprising some 1,700 hectares, to its full potential.
