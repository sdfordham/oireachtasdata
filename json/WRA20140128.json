Almost 30,000 of these recipients are in the Dublin area, <\/p><p>  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. <\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have been implemented with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available. The purpose of the rent limit review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas while ensuring that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer is achieved. <\/p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have been provided for in North Kildare and Bray areas. Statistics are not available in relation to the tenancies that were reviewed downwards as a result of reductions in rent supplement maximum limits. However, the attached tabular statement provides details of the changes in maximum rent limits for each county that came into effect following the rent reviews of January 2012 and June 2013. The current maximum rent limits for each county is also provided. Special provisions are made in exceptional circumstances including, for example, people with disabilities in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons. <\/p><p>  There has been a reduction in the number of recipients of rent supplement by almost 8,000 from December 2012 to the current date. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications received for rent supplement. <\/p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients. The fact that approximately 80,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation within the current limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.<\/p><p>  Policy and analysis in relation to social housing provision and homelessness are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.  However this Department has a role in providing income support to persons who are homeless and is represented on the National Homelessness Consultative Committee. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.<\/p><p>  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, also works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities using HAP.  Officials in the Department of Social protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  It is intended that the scheme will be piloted in early 2014 in Limerick local authority with further roll out to selected authorities during the year.   <\/p><p><b>Table 1: Change in maximum rent

However, we must also ensure that the right of free movement is used for the right motives and is not abused through unjustified claiming of benefits.<\/p><p>  The UK recently announced a series of measures in relation to the welfare entitlements of EU migrants.  These include a ban on EU migrants receiving out-of-work benefits for the first three months of residence and restrictions on the claiming of jobseeker's allowance for more than six months, unless a person can prove that they have made serious efforts to secure employment and that they have a genuine prospect of securing work.  In relation to the former, under the EU Residence Directive, all Member States already have the right to refuse support under their social assistance systems to certain migrants for the first 3 months of residence.<\/p><p>  Access to social assistance payments in Ireland is subject to the habitual residence condition.

In some cases, OFP recipients inform the Department and, where relevant, they can transfer to the back-to-education allowance (BTEA) scheme at the start of a course.  Where entitlement to the OFP payment ceases for these recipients at any point during the course, they can continue to participate in the BTEA scheme until the course is completed.<\/p><p>  In the case of customers who have not informed the Department of their study commitments, and whose entitlement to the OFP payment ceases mid-course, the main income support option available to them is the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) scheme.  However, the JA conditionality that requires recipients to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work would preclude individuals from participating in a full time education course.  Therefore the likeliest course for these customers would be to leave their course in order to qualify for a JA payment.  Such an outcome would be counter-productive and would not serve the activation objectives of the Department.  As a result, the relevant BTEA provisions have been amended to allow former OFP recipients to avail of the BTEA scheme where they are midway through a course, assuming that all of the relevant qualifying criteria are met. This approach is the only way which enables these customers to continue to receive income support from the Department while enabling them to continue their education.<\/p><p>  Students may get financial support through the means-tested student grant scheme, which is administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  Grant rates for qualifying students vary according to a number of factors, including household income, family size, and whether the student's college is close to their permanent residence.  The scheme is made up of a maintenance grant for living costs and of a fee grant that covers the student contribution charge, tuition fees, and the cost of essential field trips, as well as of a post-graduate grant in some instances.<\/p><p>  Since September, 2010, students who are in receipt of the BTEA allowance can no longer avail concurrently of the maintenance grant component of the student grant scheme.  This provision was introduced by the Department of Education and Skills in Budget 2010.  Students may however, retain eligibility for the fee grant component of the scheme, if applicable.<\/p><p>  Any changes to the eligibility and operation of the student grant scheme is an issue for my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800053#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Implementation","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800053#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[3523\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800053#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the crisis in rent supplement, including an update on claim processing times; and the total number of rent supplement recipients that will be transferred to the new housing assistance programme by the end of 2014.

There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   <\/p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income and bank statements. Some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. In cases where all the necessary information is provided at initial application stage, rent supplement claims are generally processed between two and five working days.<\/p><p>  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications. This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and dealt with in a consistent and fair manner. <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.  Approximately 50,000 of recipients are in receipt of the supplement for over 18 months. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities using HAP. <\/p><p>  Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.

The re-balancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities &ndash; payment processing, control and activation has resulted in changes in the way CWS services are delivered and the rationalisation of some Community Welfare Service clinics.<\/p><p>  In Co.

The Community Welfare Service in Athy which was formerly available two mornings per week at a walk-in clinic is now available Monday to Friday through initial telephone contact, which means the service can be delivered without the need to attend a clinic.  Telephone calls are followed by appointments if necessary, home visit or application by post for non-urgent claims. <\/p><p>  All calls are returned within one working day and emergency calls are prioritised.

The one-stop-shop element is being rolled out to all existing Social Welfare Local Offices (SWLO).  However, providing all services in a single location is a complex task given the wide variety of existing locations, lease arrangements and physical layouts of offices.  In some locations the Department has had to operate the one stop shop service from more than one office through the use of integrated IT, standardised service offers and common branding to provide a seamless and consistent service to the customer.<\/p><p>  There are many different criteria used in the assessment of whether to use the existing office accommodation or seek new office accommodation, but the principle criteria include:<\/p><p>  (a)  The current office space available in our SWLO and the degree to which it can accommodate all Intreo services;<\/p><p>  (b)  The condition of the building and the quality of the accommodation; <\/p><p>  (c)  Whether the building is State-Owned or State-Leased, and if leased, the terms and conditions of the lease.<\/p><p>  Where the current accommodation is inadequate or needs to be vacated, new accommodation may be required and the Department relies on the Office of Public Works to source new accommodation.  The first preference is for the use of existing State-owned property and failing this, the OPW will examine all other potential options available on the open market.

The State pension has been successful in ensuring older people have an adequate income.  Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest consistent poverty rate (at 1.9%) and are least likely to be at risk of poverty.  However, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary pension provision.   <\/p><p>  It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. Recent figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern.  The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges faced by Ireland, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that the task of financing future increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3\/1 at present to 2.1\/1 by 2060<\/p><p>The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System was launched in April 2013.  Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.   <\/p><p>  The OECD has indicated in its report that its first preference is a mandatory scheme, with its second preference being automatic enrolment, whereby people would be automatically enrolled but could opt out.  I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage.  It is recognised that introduction of any such initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.<\/p><p>  Decisions in this area are actively being considered and I expect to make an announcement shortly on future developments in pension policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800054#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800054#WRC00650"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[3520\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800054#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the waiting times for social welfare appeals to be decided in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, including the key social protection benefits and allowances.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing time for 2011, 2012 and 2013 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables below. <\/p><p>The average processing time for all appeals peaked in 2011 at 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2012, processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing was 39.5 weeks while there was a slight increase to 27.8 weeks for a summary decision.  This improvement continued in 2013 to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.   <\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  <\/p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,095 at 20 January 2014.<\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p><p><font color=\"#000080\">Appeals processing times by scheme 2011 &ndash;

We are awaiting confirmation of this development.  The individual named by the Deputy has been detained in Sri Lanka since 5 September 2007.  No charge was brought against him until 29 January 2013.  Since his imprisonment, both I, and my predecessor as Minister, have written to the Sri Lankan Minister for External Affairs on five occasions; in July 2008, December 2009, October 2011, June 2012 and February 2013.  In each of these letters it was stressed that the individual should either be charged and brought to trial or released.  In addition, our Ambassador raised the case on many occasions with various Sri Lankan Government Ministers.  The individual has been visited in prison on numerous occasions by Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, who travelled from India, as well as the Honorary Consul in Colombo.<\/p><p>  On 10 May 2013, following an agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities, the individual named by the Deputy read a statement in court outlining his dealings with the LTTE.  In return for this the Sri Lankan authorities had agreed to reduce the charges against him and to impose a sentence of one year of rehabilitation, following a guilty plea to these lesser charges.  On 16 May a further hearing took place and the individual was sentenced to one month in prison followed by 12 months rehabilitation.<\/p><p>  As a consequence of a meeting between the Head of the Consular Division and the wife of the individual named by the deputy, our Embassy made a formal request for a prison visit in December 2013 but did not receive the required permission in time to go ahead with it.  Our Ambassador did however travel to Sri Lanka in December and raised the case with the authorities there and in particular our desire for an early consular prison visit. Embassy officials will visit Sri Lanka in early February 2014 and an official request for a visit has been made.  A reply from the Sri Lankan authorities is awaited.  Our Embassy has also sought written confirmation of the sentence imposed and again a reply from the Sri Lankan authorities is awaited.  The wife of the individual has been kept informed of these developments.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my officials remain in close contact with the individual&rsquo;s wife and family and liaise directly with them on any request for assistance or on any development on this case.

Ireland is committed to defending the universality of human rights, and one of our key priorities is the promotion and protection of space for civil society to operate, free from harassment and intimidation.<\/p><p>  Civil society actors have come under increasing pressure in many parts of the world in recent years. In some countries, dialogue with civil society remains limited, and the space for civil society engagement is narrow or shrinking. Restrictive legislation and repressive practices in some countries have led to stigmatisation, harassment, and even criminalisation of civil society actors.<\/p><p>  As part of our commitment to the protection of civil society space, Ireland took the lead, with the support of a cross-regional group of member states consisting of Chile, Japan, Sierra Leone, and Tunisia, on a new draft resolution entitled &lsquo;Civil society space; creating and maintaining, in law and in practice a safe and enabling environment&rsquo; at the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in September 2013.<\/p><p>  The creation and maintenance of space for civil society is inextricably linked to the ability of individuals to exercise their fundamental right to the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression.  This resolution addresses, for the first time at the Human Rights Council, the issue of civil society space as a human rights concern, underlining the importance of the contribution of civil society in so many aspects of our lives, and calling on States to create and maintain, in law and practice, a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate effectively.  The draft resolution was the subject of difficult and politically sensitive negotiations.  Ireland successfully defended the draft resolution against several hostile amendments, paving the way for it to be adopted by the Council without a vote.<\/p><p>  On foot of the resolution, a panel discussion will be held during the next session of the Human Rights Council, in March 2014, on the challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for civil society, and lessons learnt and good practices in this regard.  The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is organising this panel discussion, which has been scheduled to take place on 11 March 2014.  The Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva has been working closely with OHCHR in relation to the ongoing preparations for this event.<\/p><p>  The resolution further requests OHCHR to prepare a summary report on the panel discussion, which will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session in September 2014.  Building on this report, Ireland intends to work with its partners to lead a further resolution on civil society space at the Human Rights Council.

The resolution was adopted by consensus by the Council on 26 September 2013.  Six point six (6.6) million children under the age of five die each year, mainly from preventable and treatable causes.  The resolution focuses on how the Human Rights Council can act in elaborating a human rights-based approach to this issue to support the much needed engagement of the human rights community in the ongoing efforts to strengthen accountability for children&rsquo;s health.<\/p><p>  As a result of the adoption of this resolution, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is elaborating technical guidance which will be grounded in human rights principles, and which will help national Ministries and other actors to design policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate preventable morbidity and mortality of children under five.  OHCHR is preparing this technical guidance in close consultation with the World Health Organisation and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including governments. My Department is providing financial support through the World Health Organisation for the development of the technical guidance.<\/p><p>  The resolution also mandates the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene   an expert workshop to discuss the draft technical guidance.  This workshop will be convened in 2014 in cooperation with relevant UN agencies, in particular the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS, special procedure mandate holders, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children.  It will also entail the participation of governments as well as being open to regional and civil society organisations.<\/p><p>  Finally, the resolution requests the Office of the High Commissioner to provide an oral update on the elaboration of the technical guidance before the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council, which will take place in September 2014, and to present the technical guidance to the Human Rights Council at that session.  Ireland intends to lead a further resolution at the Human Rights Council on the preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five years of age as a human rights concern, once the technical guidance is presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD02450"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[4289\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the most recent discussions he has had with the British Foreign Secretary and with other members of the British Government concerning Britain's continued membership and participation in the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This was the first Council meeting of 2014 and there was a very busy agenda.  Conclusions were agreed across a number of key policy areas; the full text of these Conclusions may be accessed on the official EU website. .  The Council reviewed developments in relation to Syria and considered the prospects for the so-called &ldquo;Geneva II&rdquo; conference which began later that week in Montreux. Ministers voiced their continuing concern in relation to the ongoing conflict, the critical humanitarian situation inside Syria, and its impact on neighbouring countries - including Lebanon and Iraq. In my intervention, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Geneva conference and welcomed the call in the Council Conclusions for a UN Security Council Resolution on the humanitarian situation, something for which Ireland has advocated for some time.<\/p><p>  The constitutional referendum in<b><\/b>Egypt and the prospective Presidential and legislative elections were also discussed, with particular reference to the conduct of the recent referendum.  In relation to Iran, the Council took note of the most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Noting that Iran had implemented the voluntary measures agreed within the framework of the Joint Plan of Action between Iran and the E3\/EU+3, the Council agreed to suspend certain EU restrictive measures against Iran for a period of six months.  Negotiations are to begin next month with a view to arriving at a comprehensive solution to the issues around Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme. I welcome these important advances.<\/p><p>  The Council took stock of the latest developments on the Middle East Peace Process, in particular the ongoing direct talks between the parties.  I joined with other Ministers in expressing full support for the talks, and for a comprehensive package of EU support in the context of a final, comprehensive peace agreement, while noting also the need for a continuing focus on critical issues on the ground.  There followed a discussion on Afghanistan focussing on the strong commitment at EU level to continue to support the country in the period ahead. Council Conclusions were adopted endorsing the EU&rsquo;s priorities for engagement with Afghanistan post-2014.<\/p><p>  Over lunch, Ministers had the opportunity to review EU-Russia relations in preparation for the EU-Russia Summit (28 January). There was a free-flowing exchange on the status of the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Russia, notably in the context of the Eastern Partnership process.  Council Conclusions on Ukraine were agreed, underlining the EU&rsquo;s concern about recent developments and emphasising the EU&rsquo;s commitment to Ukraine's political association and economic integration with the Union, based on respect for common values.<\/p><p>  The alarming reports of the deteriorating humanitarian situation and of human rights abuses in the Central African Republic remain a cause of deep concern.  During our discussions on this issue, there was general consensus on the need for the international community to step up its response to the crisis.  To this end, Ministers gave their political approval for a possible EU military operation aimed at providing a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area, in support of the African Union and taking account of UN Security Council resolution 2127.  We also welcomed discussions in other fora notably at the UN Security Council and at the High-Level Meeting on Humanitarian Action which took place in Brussels that same day and secured pledges of &euro;366 million.

The Government of Uganda has since refunded in full the &euro;4 million of Irish Aid funds which were misappropriated.<\/p><p>  Ireland continues to press the Government of Uganda for concerted action following the fraud. To date, 26 Government officials and 31 private firms are being investigated, 6 Government officials are facing trial and 1 conviction has already been secured. In total, the Ugandan Director of Public Prosecutions has opened over 100 case files which are being followed closely by our Embassy of in Kampala.  I am happy to report that the Anti-Corruption Court in Uganda is now up and running again following its temporary suspension on foot of a constitutional petition on its legality last year, which delayed many of the cases.  In addition, the Office of the Auditor General of Uganda has been conducting follow-on inquiries and audits, with the support of our Embassy in Kampala. While I was in Kampala in December I had a very positive meeting with the Auditor General and his key staff and he outlined clearly his determination to address issues of fraud and corruption in the public domain. I also invited him to Ireland to address relevant Oireachtas Committees.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s 2014 country programme in Uganda, which focuses on education, HIV and AIDS, gender-based violence, governance and livelihoods, is built around supporting projects and programmes which operate through trusted non government systems. In addition, we are continuing to provide direct support to the Office of the Auditor General which uncovered the original fraud at the Office of the Prime Minister.  I am also pleased to note that a group of Ugandan MPs are currently visiting Ireland in order to learn from our experiences of developing and implementing anti-corruption legislation, with a view to introducing similar legislation in Uganda.<\/p><p>  The Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department has increased the level of support and oversight that is being provided to the Uganda programme.  An update on the interim report from the Evaluation and Audit Unit on the misappropriation of funds (drafted in November 2012) will be completed shortly, along with a review of programme and risk management systems, as well as financial controls.  These reviews are being carried out in all Irish Aid key partner countries.  We continue to ensure strong financial oversight of the aid programme is in place in order that the valuable contribution made by Ireland towards improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people is maintained, while at the same time providing strong assurance and accountability to the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget for 2013 was &euro;622m, of which &euro;497m was managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under <i>Vote 27 International Co-operation<\/i>  , with the remainder comprising eligible funding by other Government Departments as well as Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget. <\/p><p>  Ireland has long term, strategic development partnership programmes with a small number of developing countries, called Key Partner Countries.

The Deputy should note that the total amount of EIB support in a particular year may include loans approved by the Board in that year as well as signatures in respect of loans approved in previous years.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Government's contribution to each project, as the Deputy may be aware, the European Investment Bank provides loans to both public and private entities and in all cases will normally provide up to 50% of the total cost of a project, with the balance being made up from other sources. Loans to private entities are provided on the basis of applications made by the entities themselves directly to the Bank and therefore do not involve a Government contribution.  In the case of public projects, the EIB provides assistance in the form of direct loans to the Exchequer and loans to Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). For EIB loans to the Exchequer, Ireland, via the National Treasury Management Agency, is the Borrower, with the balance of the cost of the project being made up by Exchequer and\/or other sources of financing. In these cases, the Government contribution is readily identifiable and this amount is indicated in the column on the far right of the table appended.<\/p><p>  PPPs are financed primarily by private sector funding sources, debt and equity funding.\u00a0 However there would also be some Exchequer costs for land purchase, consultancy fees etc. \u00a0The State also pays the VAT costs up-front on completion of construction rather than over the life of the project. Costs are specific to individual projects. While the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform publishes details of Financial Commitments under PPPs, details of up-front Exchequer costs are a matter for the Sanctioning Authorities.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Irish Water Investment Programme in 2012, the Local Authority Framework Loan II in 2007 and the Housing Finance Agency Environment Global Loan in 2007, information on those

has been replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 The restructured credit will be of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it will also carry the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to the higher rate of income tax arises.\u00a0 However, the credit will be more targeted, in that it will in the first instance, only be available to the principal carer of the child.<\/p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.\u00a0 A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.  The new credit is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.<\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.\u00a0 However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.\u00a0 Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.\u00a0 A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.\u00a0 It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one). In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD04050"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[3987\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the 23% VAT on tennis coaching as an after school activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[3743\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered reducing the rate of VAT for children's tennis lessons to make them more accessible for struggling parents and encourage an active lifestyle amongst children in view of the rising rates of obesity here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[3803\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800055#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason for the high level of VAT on after school tennis coaching; and if he will re-examine this 23% VAT rate.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 195 and 197 together.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 provides exemption for children's or young person's education provided by educational establishments recognised by the State and by other persons supplying education of a similar kind.\u00a0 After-school children's tennis coaching qualifies for this exemption if it is provided as a structured course in an appropriate sporting facility to students by a tutor and if a level of skill or ability is conferred which can be evaluated by comparison with objective standards.

","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the introduction of the Local Property Tax (LPT) in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State, with over 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file LPT Returns and pay the tax.\u00a0 Given the significant numbers to whom the new tax applied, its introduction needed to be carefully planned and considered, particularly as respect the obligations on property owners to self-assess the value of their property, file the appropriate tax return and make their payment of tax.\u00a0 This had to be achieved in the very challenging timeframe set for Revenue by the Government.<\/p><p>  There are several reasons why a single tax return for both income tax and LPT was not considered practical when LPT was being introduced.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided in July 2012 that LPT was to commence in 2013 on a half-year basis.\u00a0 The LPT 1 return filing date in 2013 of 7 May 2013 (or 28 May, for online filers) was specifically chosen because it allowed the various administrative arrangements for different aspects of LPT, including the range of payment options provided by Revenue, to be put in place before the 2013 LPT payment due date of 1 July 2013.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that the Income Tax return filing date for those taxpayers who were required to file a 2012 income tax return was 31 October 2013 and if LPT declarations were included in this return, it would have made the introduction of a half-year LPT charge for 2013 impossible.<\/p><p>  Another issue that makes the Deputy s suggestion impractical is that residential property owners who are obliged to file an LPT1 Return, are not necessarily obliged to file an Income Tax return. For example, the vast majority of PAYE customers, the unemployed, non-residents and those in receipt of the State pension are not obliged to file an annual return of income, where they have no other taxable income sources.\u00a0 Moreover, the LPT legislation requires that only one LPT Return should be filed for a property so where there are multiple owners of a property, the designated liable person is responsible for filing the LPT Return and paying the tax.\u00a0 In many instances of multiple properties, I am advised by Revenue based on analysis they have conducted on LPT Returns filed to date, the designated liable person is not obliged to file an Income Tax Return.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have a strong track record in simplifying the administrative processes, as far as they possibly can, for all of the taxes and duties for which they have responsibility.\u00a0 In the administration of LPT, Revenue has sought to make it as easy as possible for residential property owners to understand and comply with their LPT obligations.\u00a0 This strategy has been very successful as evidenced by the compliance rate of 91% achieved for 2013. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that combining the LPT Return with the annual Income Tax Return would not have proved beneficial to the taxpayer or to Revenue.\u00a0 In fact, it would have placed an unnecessary, additional compliance burden on some taxpayers, most likely increased the number of customer contacts for Revenue and potentially compromised the excellent voluntary compliance levels that have been achieved.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Finally, as I have set out above, introducing a single return, even on a limited basis, to cater for Income Tax and LPT would require a significant restructuring of either the Income Tax or LPT provisions and I am do not believe that the impact of such changes would be justified for any potential benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800056#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Records","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800056#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[3663\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800056#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on those controls within his Department for the management of data and files on all records relating to departmental and Government decisions; the changes introduced in 2011 to ensure the completeness of such records; and if the systems now in place are to be audited on a regular basis to ensure they are working.

However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.\u00a0 This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800056#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[3826\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800056#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the increase between bands one and two of the local property tax is &euro;135, despite the fact the increase between all other bands is &euro;90; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In devising the bands the Group considered that a balance should be struck between the width of the bands and avoiding substantial liability differences between adjacent bands. The wider the band, the easier it would be to carry out a self-assessment; but very wide bands would run the risk of creating inequities between taxpayers as well as compliance challenges.<\/p><p>  Taking account of all aspects, the Group recommended a market value based system of self-assessment involving bands of &euro;50,000 in width, for properties valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1000,000.

compensation which investors in Custom House Capital may receive, I would like the Deputy to note the following:<\/p><p>- As of 23<sup>rd<\/sup> January, 2014, the ICCL had received certified statements from the Administrator in respect of 428 claims and has paid compensation to those claimants amounting to &euro;6,624,280.\u00a0 All compensation payments were made by the ICCL within 2 weeks of having received the relevant certified statement.<\/p><p>- The\u00a0ICCL has received 1,969 claims from former clients of CHC.\u00a0 All claimants received an acknowledgement from the ICCL following receipt of their claim.\u00a0 All claimants would subsequently have received a confirmation that their claim had been passed to the Administrator, Kieran Wallace, who would verify and certify their claim in due course.\u00a0 The legislation provides that it is the Administrator, not the ICCL, who checks the validity of each claim and determines the level of compensatable loss to be paid.\u00a0 I understand the Administrator\u00a0had indicated that this will be a protracted process given the complexity of the reconciliation process.<\/p><p>  In relation\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0release of information\u00a0regarding the case and the\u00a0respective roles of the\u00a0Central\u00a0Bank and the Liquidator,\u00a0I would like the Deputy to note the following:<\/p><p>- Upon presentation of the Final Inspectors  Report to the High Court Justice Hogan ordered that CHC be wound up immediately.\u00a0 Copies of the Final Report have been provided to the Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Garda Commissioner.\u00a0 At the time the High Court outlined that the only solution in the CHC case was an immediate court sanctioned liquidation where the Liquidator would take steps to conserve the assets of the company and to ensure that payments out were made to creditors in a manner authorised by law.\u00a0 The High Court reviewed the position of Mr Kieran Wallace for this role and confirmed his appointment as Liquidator with immediate effect.<\/p><p>- The Central Bank s investigation into Custom House Capital Ltd (in Liquidation) and persons concerned in its management has been on-going since the publication of the Final Report to the High Court by Court Appointed Inspectors dated 19 October 2011. \u00a0Following consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Central Bank s investigation has been deferred pending completion of investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>- As identified in the Final Inspectors  Report, there was large scale misuse of client holdings and systematic deception by CHC that caused uncertainty surrounding the legitimate ownership of all client holdings.\u00a0 As a result, this is not a routine liquidation and, in the interests of all clients, the legitimate ownership of holdings must be established before any payment or return of holdings can be made to any client.\u00a0 The situation is further complicated by the fact that in many cases these holdings form part of various pension arrangements (e.g. ARFs, PRSAs) which are subject to additional legislation.\u00a0 Directions imposed on CHC by the Central Bank are in place to ensure that misleading information is not issued to clients about individual client holdings pending completion of reconciliation work by the Official Liquidator.<\/p><p>- As also set out in the Final Report of the High Court Inspectors, the sub-management arrangements entered into between CHC and Horwath Bastow Charleton Wealth Management Ltd sought to protect against a diminution in the value of remaining client holdings and provide a mechanism for (a) maximising a recovery of funds for clients and (b) providing transparency and ensuring fairness in the return of assets to clients.\u00a0 The Liquidator remains responsible for all reconciliation work carried out in respect of CHC related client holdings.<\/p><p>- In light of the above I cannot comment\u00a0on\u00a0details\u00a0pertaining to any\u00a0particular fund\u00a0held by CHC, whether\u00a0relating to\u00a0any investments made by the fund, assets held by the fund, etc.<\/p><p>- The process of establishing legitimate ownership of all investments involves a significant and lengthy reconciliation of client holdings that takes time to fully complete.\u00a0 As mentioned above, Mr Kieran Wallace of KPMG was appointed Official Liquidator by and is accountable to the Court for the conduct and completion of the liquidation of CHC.

It is not possible under EU law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to such services as we did not apply a zero rate to them in 1991.<\/p><p>  However, I would point out that UK passenger transport operators who establish their businesses in Ireland are subject to the same VAT rules as Irish operators.  They are exempt from VAT and not zero-rated, and as such not entitled to deductibility in respect of VAT incurred on items such as fuel.\u00a0 In addition, UK passenger transport operators who are not established in the State are not entitled to any refund of VAT incurred in this State for the purposes of carrying out passenger transport activities, whether that service takes place wholly or partially in the State or whether it takes place wholly outside the State.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  EU VAT law also provides that the VAT rate applying to petrol and diesel must be the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%.\u00a0 It is not possible to apply a lower VAT rate to such supplies.<\/p><p>  With regard to the VAT incurred on the purchase of a touring coach, I would point out that while persons who are VAT exempt cannot recover any VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business, there is special provision within the VAT code to allow a refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of touring coaches.\u00a0 Under VAT Refund Order S.I. 266 of 2012 coach operators who are exempt from VAT may, subject to the conditions in the Order, be entitled to a refund of the VAT paid on the purchase of touring coaches that are no more than 2 years old and are within specified dimensions.<\/p><p>  With regard to your question on duty rebates, any rebate on mineral oil tax under our national law must conform to the EU Energy Tax Directive. Ireland, in common with a number of other Member States, had derogations under this Directive which allowed for specific tax reliefs or rate reductions for fuel used for particular purposes, including school transport services.\u00a0 The European Commission, which is the deciding authority, ruled against an extension of these derogations and the Member States affected, including Ireland, were obliged to withdraw these tax reliefs. Ireland accordingly withdrew the relief that covered bus services, including school buses, with effect from 1 November 2008. <\/p><p>  The Energy Tax Directive obliges all Member States to exempt jet fuel used by airlines and fuel used by shipping in Community waters from duty, but does not allow for a similar exemption to be applied to fuel used by road transport operators. The Directive does, however, allow Ireland and other Member States to give a rebate on diesel used by road transport operators and I introduced the Diesel Rebate Scheme last year on that basis. That scheme enables qualifying transport operators to claim a repayment of part of the mineral oil tax paid on auto-diesel purchased in the State for use in qualifying vehicles in the course of business.\u00a0 There is no equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The amount of the repayment will vary in accordance with the average price at which auto-diesel is available for purchase in the State during a repayment period, subject to a maximum of 7.5 cent per litre.\u00a0 The rebate rate applicable for the current repayment period is 6.2 cent per litre.\u00a0 In addition to the diesel rebate scheme, it should also be borne in mind that the rate of mineral oil tax on auto-diesel in Ireland is considerably lower than in Northern Ireland; &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres compared with &euro;695.93 in Northern Ireland at the current exchange rate.<\/p><p>  Fuel laundering has been a problem for many years but, with changes in the sulphur content of marked fuel in 2011, it became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically.\u00a0 Revenue is very aware of the threat that fuel laundering poses to consumers, legitimate business and to the Exchequer and, in response, has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities. To that end Revenue is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker for joint use in the UK and Ireland and continued robust enforcement action. There are severe penalties available to the courts on conviction for a fuel laundering offence. The Courts can impose of fine of up to &euro;126,970 and\/or a custodial sentence of up to five years, on a person convicted of an indictable offence relating to fuel laundering. In addition, where the value of the fuel involved in the offence is more that &euro;250,000, a fine of three times the value of the products may be imposed. <\/p><p>  Revenue maintains very close working relationships with fuel sector representative bodies to improve the integrity of the distribution system and to challenge those suppliers involved in supplying rogue elements with marked fuel for laundering. The legitimate trade can contribute to closing down the illicit trade by providing information on traders supplying fuel to launderers, outlets that are selling laundered diesel and on persons knowingly using green diesel in road vehicles.\u00a0 Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.\u00a0 A person who suspects or has evidence that laundered diesel is being sold in their area should report this through their representative associations to Revenue.\u00a0 Any such reports are treated as confidential and are fully investigated by Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800057#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800057#WRF03350"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[4175\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800057#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects to be in a position to extend the Living City Initiative; if it will include all Georgian buildings in Dublin city which are used as principle private residences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I announced in my Budget Statement that the Living City Initiative, which was enacted in the Finance Act 2013, would be extended to now include the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kilkenny as well the original target cities of Limerick and Waterford.

The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 further strengthened the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. <\/p><p>  At EU level, the Irish Presidency was to the fore in prioritising a number of dossiers geared towards enhancing the international regulatory environment which ensures that our regulatory framework is benchmarked against other EU and international jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank. The Bank's new\u00a0risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM) represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  This new approach is supported by\u00a0a significant growth in staff numbers leading to the establishment of new directorates and divisions.  The Bank is committed to continuing\u00a0to review internal governance arrangements to ensure that it has the appropriate internal structure, resources and organisational capability to achieve its strategic goals. <\/p><p>  In 2012, the Bank published its three-year Strategic Plan for the period 2013-2015 which sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision, underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement, in order to deliver on its key strategic priorities over the coming years.  The Bank intends\u00a0that\u00a0reform of its regulatory and supervisory framework will be deepened over the term of the plan to minimise future risks to financial stability and enhance consumer protection, while continuing to promote a better functioning financial sector.

Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.\u00a0 In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child including financially.\u00a0 The new credit is targeted to assist principal child carers to take up, or remain in employment. It should not be considered merely as a supplementary source of income, or an alternative to the financial support of a parent. <\/p><p>  Similarly, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.\u00a0 A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.\u00a0 It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one). In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.<\/p><p>  This measure was approved by the Oireachtas and enacted in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 only last month.

Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents. At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes. Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools. Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child. Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim. <\/p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents. The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support. With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.<\/p><p>  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process. The information regarding applications for inclusion in the scheme of funding for the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools is not yet available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800059#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments Data","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800059#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[3732\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800059#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of pupils who entered the primary education system in 2013; and if he will provide the information for each county.","asker":"1018","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[3733\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800059#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of pupils that will be leaving the primary school system in 2014 nationwide; and if he will provide the information for each county.","asker":"1018","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[3734\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800059#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary school pupils currently in senior infants, first class, second class, third class, fourth class and fifth class; and if he will provide the information for each county.","asker":"1018","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 to 257, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The information requested is provided in the National School Annual Census Return.

in doing so, a capital budget of &euro;3.4 billion was set for 2013. A breakdown by Department is available in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013 which can be found on my Department's website. Decisions in relation to the types of projects and programmes to be funded from the individual Departmental allocations are made by line Ministers and their Departments.<\/p><p>  A 2009 survey, carried out by the Department of Finance, found that the labour intensity of capital projects generally falls within the range of 8 to 12 jobs for every &euro;1 million invested. While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, it is important to note that the amount of employment generated by capital expenditure depends on how that expenditure is invested. For example, the purchase of new rail rolling stock would typically generate little direct employment in Ireland as such stock is generally produced abroad. Furthermore, different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity. For example, smaller scale projects such as school building and repair, or smaller local and regional road-works, tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects.<\/p><p>  The capital budget for 2013 is part of the larger Exchequer capital Framework for the period 2012 to 2016 of some &euro;17 billion. The focus of the Framework is on infrastructural investment that can aid economic growth, generate sustainable jobs in the medium term, and address urgent social requirements. Much of the capital programme for the five year period of the Framework is geared towards smaller, more labour intensive projects. It is also noteworthy that investment in enterprise supports has the highest direct employment impact. Accordingly, the Framework made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.<\/p><p>  Since the capital plan was launched in 2011, the Government has been able to announce a number of increases to its infrastructure investment through the introduction of a new PPP pipeline and the use of the proceeds from the State asset and Lottery licence transactions. This additional investment is expected to support significant numbers of jobs across the country. The previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline may support in the region of 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs. In addition to this, it is envisaged that the additional Exchequer funding of &euro;150 million, which I announced in June of last year, can support up to 3,000 jobs. A total of &euro;60m of this additional Exchequer investment was made in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800061#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800061#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[4196\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800061#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if small and medium enterprises represented an increased proportion of companies tendering for public contracts in 2013; if they represented an increased proportion of awarded companies; the number of SMEs that were awarded public sector contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>I am aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

I understand from IDA Ireland that there are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.  While IDA Ireland does try to influence the location decisions of  prospective and existing client companies, the decision relating to where to visit and where to locate are ultimately a matter for the investor. <\/p><p>  As I have said on more than one occasion in this House, I am of course concerned at the lack of investment in certain regional locations and I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.<\/p><p>  However, that having been said, it must be acknowledged that some locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  I should also point out that 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s base of companies including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork. <\/p><p>  The Regional Aid Guidelines enable the State&rsquo;s industrial development agencies to pay grants, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  All such grants come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. <\/p><p>  The guidelines for 2014 to 2020 were adopted by the Commission on 19 June 2013 and will enter into force on 1 July 2014. As a result, changes to Regional Aid grant rules will not be possible until 2021. <\/p><p>As things stand<b>,<\/b> Kerry qualifies for regional investment aid for SME&rsquo;s under the current 2007-2013 Regional Aid Map, at a rate of 20% for medium sized companies (50 to 249 employees) and 30% for small companies (under 50 employees). Since January 2009<b>,<\/b>   Kerry no longer qualifies for regional aid for investment projects by large companies.  <\/p><p>  For the 2014-2020 Irish Regional Aid Map, economic data such as unemployment and Gross Domestic Product for all counties, including Kerry, will once again be analysed afresh when deciding which counties will be designated for Regional Aid. <\/p><p>  If Kerry, or any other Irish region, was to be designated, aid to all categories of companies would be allowed.  The rates for SME&rsquo;s would be the same as those that apply in 2007-2013.  The rates for investment by large companies would be 10% for certain activities only. <\/p><p>  My officials are currently compiling the most up to date economic data for each county in order to determine which counties will qualify for inclusion in a revised Regional Aid Map for Ireland. Once this data has been compiled and analysed, qualifying regions up to a maximum of 51.28% of the total population will be included in the new map. This must be agreed by Government and submitted to the Commission by the end of June, 2014. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of State investment e.g. Research &amp;amp; Development Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid and Aid for Environmental protection etc. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Data","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[3609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of JobBridge interns taken on in County Louth in his Department from September 2013 until January 2014.","asker":"1066","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>My Department is a participant in the \"JobBridge National Internship Scheme&rdquo; providing work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.

The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) published a report in November 2013 that projects more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.<\/p><p>  Having consulted with my colleague, Mr. Ruairi Quinn TD, Minister for Education and Skills, who has responsibility for first tracking graduate destinations for graduates, I understand the following to be the case.  While it is not possible to quantify the numbers of graduates entering the labour market from Irish and EEA institutions, the November 2013 EGFSN report, &ldquo;Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills&rdquo;, sets out forecasts for ICT graduate supply to 2018. The forecasts, which were prepared by the Higher Education Authority, indicate that 3,331 people were expected to graduate from mainstream ICT programmes at level 8 and above during 2013. As a proportion of these graduates would be expected to go on to further study, take up employment abroad or be otherwise unavailable for employment in Ireland, the report estimates that an additional 2,274 level 8+ mainstream graduates would be available for employment in Ireland in 2013. A further 883 people were also expected to graduate from conversion programmes at level 8 and above and be available for employment during 2013. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these numbers, commitments made in the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2013 for this Department, have delivered a range of additional measures to streamline and simplify the Employment Permit application process, with shortages in the ICT sector specifically in mind. Almost half (1,463) of new Employment Permits issued during 2013 were for applicants with critical ICT skills, both within and beyond the ICT sector itself, of which 61 were in respect of non-EEA graduates of both Irish and foreign colleges. Potential job openings for ICT graduate professionals was estimated at 5,548 by the EGFSN in 2013 leaving the remainder to be filled from other sources.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills and I are currently developing a new ICT Action Plan, informed by the progress to date in implementing the measures under the first ICT Action Plan, and the EGFSN Report. Under the first ICT Action Plan, doubling of level 8 graduate output is now expected to be achieved by 2015 (3 years ahead of schedule). There has been a 58% increase in the number of students presenting for higher level maths over past 3 years, 4,000 places have been provided on ICT reskilling\/conversion courses at level 8 and over.<\/p><p>  The latest EGFSN report presents new demand scenarios for high level ICT skills to 2018. The New Plan will bring together actions by industry, education providers and the state sector to meet the challenge of ICT skills shortages.  It will be launched shortly.  The focus of the new Plan will be on increasing the supply of graduates and skilled professionals with core ICT\/electronic engineering qualifications at honours degree level and above in both the short term and medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector Issues","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL03250"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[4184\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason for the delay in delivery of the integrated licensing application system for the retail sector; the amount by which it will reduce the annual cost of regulatory requirements for local convenience stores when introduced; the date on which the system will be rolled out to other sectors of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s report, &ldquo;The Review and Audit of Licences&rdquo;, which assessed 159 licences across key sectors of the economy recommended the introduction of an integrated licensing system.

The Government imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.

These centres consolidate research activities across higher education institutes to create a critical mass of internationally leading researchers in strategic areas which will lay the foundation for effective and productive academic and industrial partnerships. The seven centres have 150 industry partners in place with a commitment by industry of &euro;100 million over the next six years matched with SFI funding of almost &euro;200 million.<\/p><p>  The seven centres will directly support approximately 800 highly skilled personnel (senior researchers (PIs), Post Docs, and PhD Students).  Through the commercial application of the research in the centres further jobs will be created in partner companies and spin-outs.   For example Irish Photonic Integration Centre (IPIC) focuses on new applications in ICT and medical device areas with the target of stimulating the creation of 200 jobs in these key sectors over the next six years and Insight, the Centre for Data Analytics, will position Ireland at the heart of global Data Analytics research and aims to create 300 direct jobs over the next six years.<\/p><p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s objective to accelerate economic and societal returns form investment in research the Technology Centre programme, a joint initiative of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, addresses the advanced research needs of industry in Ireland. More than 300 companies, multinational corporations and indigenous companies, are already benefiting from Ireland&rsquo;s largest industry-led research programme driving innovation and delivering results in the areas of: cloud and learning technologies; manufacturing and materials; energy, food and health; financial services and business processes. Technology centres aim to introduce companies to the research expertise in Higher Education Institutes with the objective of generating innovative technologies. Each centre has an industry steering group which controls the direction of the research performed in the centre, enabling each centre to reach its full potential. <\/p><p>  Fourteen technology centres have been fully established to date including two additional centres, in the economically important areas of Data Analytics and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, which were established in 2013 in line with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. While initial stage funding for a technology centre in Connected Health was approved during 2013 it is expected that this will be fully established in early 2014.  CeADAR (the Centre for Applied Data Analytics Research) has been established to accelerate the development, deployment and adoption of Data Analytics technology and relevant innovations. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturing technology centre was established to support and develop the Irish pharmaceutical industry by improving manufacturing competitiveness and enhancing the research and development mandate and activity of Irish pharmaceutical manufacturing sites and companies. Enterprise Ireland will invest &euro;1 million per annum in each of these centres over the next 5 years. Both of these centres are based around 5 year industry-led research agendas and it is too early for these recently established centres to have leveraged private investment or created employment in companies beyond the 16 research staff currently employed in the centres.  It is expected, nevertheless, that these centres will leverage from the companies involved as much as 40% of the State investment as they mature and will also contribute to the employment and turnover growth of participant firms. <\/p><p>  Independent analysis commissioned by Enterprise Ireland has found that the seven technology centres that have reached the &ldquo;half way point&rdquo; in their funding cycles have helped to create &euro;69 million of turnover to date in member companies and this is expected to rise to &euro;272 million by 2018. These centres have also helped to create159 full time equivalent jobs to date, and this is expected to rise to 371 full time equivalent jobs by 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04050"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[4190\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness improved during 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>Forfas&rsquo;s most recent report on Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, &ldquo;Cost of Doing Business 2012&rdquo;, published in April 2013, indicates that our cost competitiveness has improved markedly over the last number of years.  <\/p><p>  Between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland recorded a 22.5% loss in competitiveness, fuelled by an unsustainable consumption and property boom.  Since 2008, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost.<\/p><p>  There have been falls in relative prices in a number of areas.  Labour is the most significant cost for most businesses and the latest Eurostat figures show that the labour cost index in Ireland fell by 1.6% in Quarter 3 of 2013, compared with Quarter 3 2012. Over the two year period 2011-2012, there has been a very significant improvement of almost 20% in our unit wage costs relative to the rest of Europe.<\/p><p>  Construction costs and rental costs for both office and industrial space have fallen dramatically for new businesses since the collapse of the property bubble. Rental costs for office space, for example, declined by 45% between 2007 and 2011.  Other property related costs such as stamp duty have also been reduced.<\/p><p>  Similarly, the Forf&aacute;s report shows that the cost of the majority of business and professional services in Ireland has fallen since 2006.  <\/p><p>  My Department has identified measures to simplify the administrative burden on businesses to the potential value of over &euro;207 million per annum, by cutting out paperwork, revising rules for small businesses and making better use of online services.  Programmes such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s LEAN Business offering and innovation supports are helping companies to address competitiveness issues and improve productivity.  The reform of statutory wage setting mechanisms has also improved competitiveness in a number of sectors.  <\/p><p>In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s overall international competitiveness position, we have seen a significant improvement in recent years. The latest IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, published in May 2013, shows Ireland improving to 17th position in the rankings, up from 24th in 2011.  Ireland is ranked 15th   in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2014 report and was recently named by Forbes magazine as the &ldquo;Best Country for Business&rdquo;. However, there is no room for complacency, and policies to improve cost competitiveness are vital if we are to continue to increase employment.<\/p><p>  Through the Action Plans for Jobs in 2012 and 2013, the Government has focussed on creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland.  The Action Plans have included a range of concrete measures to address issues which impact on our competitiveness position.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s exit from the Troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. <\/p><p>  I am currently finalising the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, which will build on the progress made in recent years and will include further measures aimed at reducing costs for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04250"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[4191\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there was an improved availability of skills required for the manufacturing sector in the Irish labour force during 2013; if he has engaged with the Department of Education and Skills to improve foreign language skills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[4197\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800062#WRL04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the net number of jobs that were created in the manufacturing sector during 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 346 together.<\/p><p>  I initiated an analysis of the skills requirements for the manufacturing sector in 2012, and this was published in April last.

This Report was undertaken by my Department, working with the Central Bank and the Pensions Board, and with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations. The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges. The report shows that small percentages can add up to big reductions in a pension fund over time. <\/p><p>  The launch of the Report was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders. There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment. Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work is underway. <\/p><p>  A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.  Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained within the Report on Pension Charges and work has commenced in this regard. <\/p><p>  Additionally, progress on the issue of pension charges will be supported by recent actions to restructure the Pensions Board and strengthen governance and regulation of the country&rsquo;s occupational pensions and give consumer representatives a greater input into pensions policy.

The range of possible actions in this area would then be considered and, should it prove necessary, I will bring a further policy and regulatory response to Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":704,"content":"<p>Question No. 357 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Benefits Scheme","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02350"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[3487\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will clarify the position in respect of the abolition of the telephone allowance; the implications this decision has had on old age pensioners and persons living alone in rural isolated areas; if she has given due consideration to an alternative system for persons who live on their own; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[3546\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the rationale behind the removal of the free telephone allowance from the household benefits package; if it is envisaged that this payment will be reinstated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. <\/p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. <\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was abolished from 1 January 2014. I am not in a position to reinstate the allowance. <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week. While the decision to the telephone allowance was a difficult one it allowed my Department to maintain at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence. These are very valuable supports for customers. We have also maintained the value of the fuel allowance and free travel. <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full. The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer. The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. <\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million. There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02650"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[3488\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite a disability allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":711,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 18 December 2013.

Where any customers are not able by reason of illness or disability to attend an appointment arrangements will be made to see them in their home.  <\/p><p>  The situation will be kept under constant review and will be examined in the context of resources available and service requirements into the future.<\/p><p>  Contact details for the Community Welfare Service in the areas affected are as follows:<\/p><p><br \/><table><tr><th>Area<\/th><th>Telephone<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Athy - Castledermot<\/td><td>045 - 887831<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dunlavin &ndash; Ballitore &ndash; Baltinglass <\/td><td>045 - 887829<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monasterevin &ndash; Rathangan - Kildare<\/td><td>045 0 887830<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge &ndash; Curragh - Suncroft<\/td><td>045 - 887821<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clane &ndash; Kilmeague &ndash; Prosperous &ndash; Robertstown - Allenwood<\/td><td>045 - 887823<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Naas &ndash; Caragh &ndash; Sallins &ndash; Johnstown &ndash; Kill - Kilcullen<\/td><td>1800 - 383899<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rent Supplement Claims<\/td><td>1890 - 800698<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mortgage Interest Supplement claims<\/td><td>045 - 887833<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fax Number for Referrals<\/td><td>045 - 887845<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Postal Address for all Referrals<\/td><td>P.O.

","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and the tenant. The Department has no relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and\/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and\/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour. <\/p><p>  Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 tenants are obliged not to behave within a dwelling, or in the vicinity of it, in a way that is anti-social. Landlords are obliged to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, and may seek termination of a tenancy due to a tenant&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour.  Landlords who fail to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations may be subject to a fine imposed by the PRTB. Termination of the tenancy would result in the termination of rent supplement.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management. Statistics are not available on the number of rent supplement cases withdrawn for this reason.  <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals, which would also result in these individuals being subject to the local authority vetting procedures. This will be delivered through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) with local authorities taking over the responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of individuals who have long term housing needs and are currently in receipt of rent supplement. The Department is currently working closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to implement a pilot of the HAP scheme in early 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM03900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM03950"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[3598\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800063#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason the position of community development officer with responsibility for community employment schemes has been moved from Ballina DSP office to Castlebar DSP office; the reason Ballina will no longer have a community development officer with responsibility for community employment based in the town; the recruitment process for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is important that all schemes operated by the Department, including widow(er)'s and surviving civil partner's contributory pension, are subject to review and continuing eligibility checks. This includes conducting fraud and error surveys which serve to reaffirm the entitlement of randomly selected recipients to their payments. <\/p><p>  The Department has agreed criteria with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the successful implementation of baseline fraud and error surveys.  <\/p><p>  The process involves:<\/p><p>  - Social welfare inspectors reviewing a random sample (circa 1,000) of claims to assess the underlying levels of fraud and error and reporting back to the relevant scheme area<\/p><p>  - Action being taken by scheme managers to address the fraud and error risks identified<\/p><p>  - Learning from each survey which is applied in the operation of future surveys.<\/p><p>  A random control survey, by its nature, must be conducted without prior notification to the recipients selected.  Inspectors visit the address of the recipient as held on the Department&rsquo;s records.  There is an onus on all customers of the Department, regardless of age, to cooperate with the process when requested, confirming their identity and compliance with other scheme specific criteria.  The Department&rsquo;s experience is that people selected to participate in the surveys are more than willing to participate; people legitimately claiming their entitlements acknowledge the efforts of the Department to ensure social welfare expenditure is appropriately applied.<\/p><p>  A fraud and error survey of 1,000 widow(er)'s and surviving civil partner's contributory pension claims commenced in Quarter 3, 2013.  Details of the randomly selected claims were sent to relevant Social Welfare Inspectors throughout the country, to interview the recipients and determine if they continued to satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment, together with any increases payable. <\/p><p>In the case of the widow(er)'s and surviving civil partner's contributory pension recipient  referred to by the Deputy, the Social Welfare Inspector made a number of attempts in September 2013 to arrange the required interview.  The person concerned advised the inspector, by telephone on 17<sup>th<\/sup>   September 2013, that she was not prepared to engage with the Department&rsquo;s survey. This was despite the Inspector clearly outlining to her that continuing her payment may be affected and that a phone call could not be regarded as sufficient verification of her identity. <\/p><p>Subsequent action to suspend payment arose as a result of the Department being unable to validate the recipient&rsquo;s identity or any change in circumstances which may affect her continuing eligibility to the payment.  A letter issued on 9<sup>th<\/sup>   January 2013 notifying her that her payment was being suspended due to her failure to cooperate with the control survey. The letter also afforded her the continuing opportunity to contact the Department for completion of the interview and survey.  She declined to cooperate with every effort made in this case.<\/p><p>  I sincerely regret the distress that this matter caused. However, I am sure the Deputy will fully appreciate that the Department takes very seriously its responsibilities to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent properly and that officials of the Department are doing the job requested of them, in a very professional manner, to achieve this fundamental objective.

This additional capacity will augment the Department&rsquo;s own activation capacity as well as that already contracted with the providers of Local Employment Services (LES).<\/p><p>  JobPath contractors have not yet been appointed. A request for tenders issued on 12 December 2013 with a closing date of 28 February 2014.  Taking account of the time required for the tender evaluation process, it is expected that contracts will be awarded in April\/May 2014.  It is expected that successful tenderers will require about 6 months to set up operations following contract award.  On this basis JobPath should commence operations towards the end of this year at which point the department will commence scheduling jobseekers for referral.     <\/p><p>Tender documentation has been published on   while information on JobPath is available on <\/p><p>  Contractors will be paid a mixture of registration fees and job sustainment fees.  The registration fees will be paid upon completion of a personal progression plan for each jobseeker. However the bulk of income will be derived from job sustainment fees.  These payments will be made only if the jobseeker secures employment while on the JobPath programme and only in respect of discrete periods of sustained employment of 13 weeks up to a maximum of 52 weeks.  Accordingly, the overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the prices that are agreed as well as the number of jobseekers who complete periods of sustained employment.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that JobPath will deliver an individual case management service for all clients referred to assist them in removing barriers to employment.  This case management service will be delivered over the 12 month period that clients are engaged on the JobPath programme.<\/p><p>  There are a number of points worthy of note.  <\/p><p>  First, successful tenderers will not be able to recover their costs or make any profit unless they place jobseekers into sustained employment.  <\/p><p>  Second, the Department has built in a mechanism to discount fees should overall employment levels exceed forecasted levels thus restricting successful tenderers from benefitting as a result of any general improvement in economic conditions.  <\/p><p>  Third, the Department has specified retention fee arrangements to ensure that contractors meet certain service quality levels.  <\/p><p>  Finally a significant advantage of the approach is that it enables the Government to match the cost of achieving an employment outcome with the saving from reduced welfare payments, this is an important consideration in the context of the constraints on public expenditure.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of the tender, the Department estimated that about 110,000 clients per annum may be referred to JobPath over a four year period.  Tenderers are expected to commit in their tender responses to improve progression rate into employment by 30% compared to the historic progression for such clients.<\/p><p>  Under the Freedom of Information Acts a person has a right of access to a record held by a person providing a service for a public body under a contract for services in so far as it relates to the service. Therefore JobPath contractors will be subject to these provisions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800065#WRO04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800065#WRO04450"},{"type":"question","counter":853,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[4089\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800065#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the schemes-activities that will be offered to persons with JobPath-JobBridge-training courses-work placement-unpaid internships; the way it will be regulated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. The tabular statement provides details of the number of rent supplement recipients in Dublin and the surrounding counties.<\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have been implemented with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014. The rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available. The purpose of the rent limit review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas while ensuring that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer is achieved. <\/p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have been provided for in North Kildare and Bray areas. <\/p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients. The fact that approximately 80,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement, with almost 38,000 in Counties Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, shows rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation within the rent limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs. <\/p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has a minimum income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;40 for a couple which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. The minimum contribution represents between 13% and 16% of the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance. <\/p><p>  The Department has no evidence showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups.  The tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form, which includes the amount of rent, and declare that the information provided is correct and accurate.  The Department&rsquo;s form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution.  <\/p><p>The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of enquiry for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy. <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences.  <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities using HAP.  Officials in the Department of Social protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  It is intended that the scheme will be piloted in early 2014 in Limerick local authority with further roll out to selected authorities during the year.<\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement Recipients in Dublin and surrounding counties &ndash; December 2013<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>No Cases<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>29,541<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>4,135<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>1,941<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>2,381<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Data","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP02350"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[4238\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total number of appeals currently on hand in respect of each category of social welfare payment; the current average waiting time for decisions in such cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":888,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of appeals currently on hand and the average waiting time for each category of social welfare payment is contained in the table below.  The average processing time for all appeals peaked in 2011 at 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2012, processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing was 39.5 weeks while there was a slight increase to 27.8 weeks for a summary decision.  This improvement continued in 2013 to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.   <\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  <\/p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of <\/p><p>  process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 14,996 at 24 January 2014.<\/p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p><p><b>Appeals processing times 01\/01\/2013 to 31\/12\/2013 &amp;amp;

","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":895,"content":"<p>I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011 to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the interaction of the tax and social protection systems, recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group is currently progressing its final module of work on the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems to determine how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment while incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency. The Group will report to me on these issues once their examination of the various issues has been completed.<\/p><p>  As part of their analysis the Advisory Group are examining replacement rates for given income levels. Replacement rates are tools used to measure the degree to which out-of-work benefits when unemployed replace take home income from work.  While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.  <\/p><p>  Replacement rate analysis, as supported by research by the ESRI, demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year.<\/p><p>  In this regard it may be noted that almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves. They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, 52% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate. <\/p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and\/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. However, it is important to note that only some 9% of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of rent supplement, with a further 1.5% in receipt of mortgage interest supplement. The vast majority of jobseekers do not receive these additional supports. <\/p><p>  Significant moves have already been taken to address the impact of housing entitlements upon replacement rates. Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced. It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection (currently provided through rent supplement) to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment.<\/p><p>  The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of housing assistance payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the rent supplement scheme. This will have a positive impact on replacement rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":896,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03050"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[4244\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of previously self-employed applicants currently awaiting decision in respect of entitlement to job seekers allowance or other allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":898,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not segregated from the total number of jobseekers allowance claims pending decision, which I am informed was 10,148 at the end of December 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03250"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[4245\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the numbers of the live register have been reduced in the course of the past three years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the tabular statement.<\/p><p><b>Live Register Year end and average for 2011, 2012 and 2013<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total Live Register<\/td><td>434,784<\/td><td>423,733<\/td><td>395,411<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Change from  previous year<\/td><td>-2,295<\/td><td>-11,051<\/td><td>-28,322<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Percentage change over the previous year<\/td><td>-0.5%<\/td><td>-2.5%<\/td><td>-6.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monthly Average for the Year<\/td><td>444,905<\/td><td>436,254<\/td><td>418,950<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":902,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03450"},{"type":"question","counter":903,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[4264\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800066#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a domiciliary care allowance appeal will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":904,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned on the 5th April 2013.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in the Irish market can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS to certain designated Electoral Divisions, including the area of Borrisokane referred to by the Deputy.  The broadband service contracted under NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Tipperary.  This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m premises with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  Last week, I introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il, to allow the ESB to utilise its electricity network to install a new high speed broadband communications network.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Borrisokane and Holycross in County Tipperary before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles.  Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800067#WRQ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Administration","counter":975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800068#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":976,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[3850\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800068#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there are circumstances whereby a house constructed after 2006 may be included for consideration for funding under the better energy warmer homes scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Most recently, the adverse weather conditions and electricity outages over the period 18 December to 6 January last caused intermittent service availability difficulties. &quot;3&quot; have advised my Department that these sites have performed as expected since then. <\/p><p>  In addition, some of the NBS customers in the Ballydavid area experienced intermittent service disruption late last year as a result of an external interference disrupting signals from the serving site. &ldquo;3&rdquo; received assistance from ComReg and deployed additional external engineers to help identify the source of the interference.  I understand that the problem was fully resolved on 02 December last.<\/p><p>  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to  or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2. <\/p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.

Through its Ocean Energy Programme the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has conducted wave and tidal resource studies to examine the energy yield from these technologies at their current stage of development.  The largest accessible tidal resource occurs around the Antrim coast while the largest accessible wave energy resource lies around the western and southern coasts of Ireland. Some small isolated locations of good tidal flows occur around the west coast of Ireland.  However, it is considered that when combined they would yield smaller amounts of energy compared to the offshore wave and wind resources.  It should also be noted that high waves approaching the western coast can limit the use of tidal turbines which are more suited to shallower depths.  Given the fact that the wholesale electricity markets of Ireland and Northern Ireland are operated as Single Electricity Market (SEM), there may be scope for regional cooperation on the development of tidal technologies.  Regional collaboration on the development of the offshore renewable energy will be an action area in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I will be publishing shortly. <\/p><p>  Since 2005, the SEAI has provided almost &euro;3m in grant support for tidal energy research and development projects.

Considerable analysis of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals will be required to ensure that the framework allows for action that is cost effective and does not place a disproportionate burden on EU energy consumers<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800068#WRR02900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":1017,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800068#WRR02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1018,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[4267\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800068#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the plans and consents issued to develop the proposed Emerald Express transatlantic fibre-optic cable from the United States to make landfall in Killala, County Mayo; the plans intended and being pursued by his Department in conjunction with all stakeholders, including private broadband service providers, towards ensuring and maximising connectivity for towns like Killala, Ballina and Crossmolina in the immediate vicinity and throughout County Mayo, including the town of Belmullet where it was initially suggested the cable could make landfall; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1070","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1019,"content":"<p>Any consents and permissions required for the landing of this cable are a matter for the Company, the Department of Environment Community and Local Government and the Local Authority.  I have no function in that regard. <\/p><p>  The choice of landing point and terrestrial route of the cable is a matter for the Company and I understand that these matters are currently under consideration.  I am therefore not in a position to say which towns or which route will be selected at this time.<\/p><p>  My Department has also secured State Aid approval to bring the telecommunications ducts laid alongside the Galway-Mayo gas pipeline into use.  A project has commenced to test these ducts with a view to bringing them into use as soon as possible.  It is envisaged that fibre in these ducts will be available to commercial service providers in areas where next generation access is not currently available.  It is intended that a number of interconnection points will be provided which will allow network operators to bring connectivity from neighbouring towns to this fibre.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. Issues regarding obligations which might be placed on any potential contractor to be engaged as a result of the procurement process will be considered as part of the detailed design of the intervention.  It is my intention to publish the map showing existing and planned next generation broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for the intervention, later this year. <\/p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014. <\/p><p>  I am aware that at least one commercial operator has launched next generation broadband services in Mayo, and announced plans to bring these services to additional towns over the next two years.  Through the combination of commercial investment, the State led investment envisaged in the National Broadband Plan and the initiative to bring the Galway-Mayo ducting into use I am confident that the towns of Kilalla, Ballina, Crossmolina and Belmullet, and all areas across Mayo, will have access to high speed broadband.

The role of the WSTO is to support the delivery of the water sector reform programme on behalf of the local government sector, by co-ordinating the involvement of the 34 County and City Councils on a range of matters including standardised data gathering, financial analysis, HR negotiations, negotiation of SLAs and transition planning, all of which were required while daily water services operations were maintained. The WSTO prepared a detailed business case setting out its proposed role, functions and funding requirements. A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between my Department and the WSTO setting out the common understanding between the parties in relation to the role and functions of the WSTO during 2013 and 2014 and the agreed funding mechanism. <\/p><p>  Of the &euro;5.7m funding provided to the WSTO in 2013 some &euro;1.7m was paid in respect of the staff from local authorities seconded to work in the dedicated transition office in two locations - Dublin and Waterford.

The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation, and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012. <\/p><p>Establishing the new organisation under the umbrella of a mature semi-State, which is already a regulated utility operating in the Irish corporate environment, has a number of advantages including the key capabilities that could be brought to bear in the set-up of Irish Water &ndash; a track record in raising finance, experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment, and specific skills from its own experience of transformation; customer relations, network management and metering, and utility operation systems.   <\/p><p>  The role of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) was key to bringing the necessary skills and competencies to the project, allowing the utility to be established within an ambitious timeline at least cost and least risk, by leveraging from their knowledge, systems and skills and matching this with skills within the water sector. It was recognised that in addition external service providers would be required as part of this process. <\/p><p>  BGE had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m plus &euro;30m contingency and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives.<\/p><p>  The procurement by Irish Water of external resources was a matter for the company and I had no role in approving individual contracts. However, the company has recently indicated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht that the following major companies were used by the Irish Water Programme to help deliver the required systems and processes in the establishment of Irish Water - IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG. The company also indicated that to date some &euro;50m has been spent on external service providers in establishing Irish Water. The services being delivered by external providers include the development of customer and asset management IT systems, the development of business and operational systems, services relating to finance, governance and regulation and quality assurance services.<\/p><p>  Further details of the contracts relating to the establishment of Irish Water are set out in the submission made by the company above-mentioned to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, and this submission has been published on the company&rsquo;s website at . In compliance with the conditions attached by my Department to the recovery of establishment costs, BGE confirmed that public procurement rules were being observed and provided a report on the outcome of the process in March 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Funding","counter":1071,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1072,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[3556\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount budgeted in his Department&rsquo;s accounts in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 for Irish Water; the amount drawn down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. <\/p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. Approximately 360,000 properties have been registered for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, which has raised in excess of &euro;398m to date over its five years of operation. It is not possible to state with any certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge, and therefore an estimate of the overall collection rate would not be sound. However, I am confident that compliance levels are high as a result of data matching undertaken with other public bodies, such as the Private Residential Tenancies Board, as provided for under the Act. The amount raised by the Charge to date also indicates a high compliance rate.<\/p><p>  2013 was the final year of the operation of the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge although local authorities will continue to pursue arrears outstanding in the period from 2009 to 2013.

","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1113,"content":"<p>The local government funding model is changing considerably in 2014. Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing this year, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund, as General Purpose Grants. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing.   <\/p><p>The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed.   <\/p><p>In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allowed maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. In allocating general purpose funding for 2014 I have sought to ensure, in combination with the funding being made available through Irish Water, that these elements of support for local authorities would be maintained around 2013 levels.      It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances. <\/p><p>I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1114,"content":"<p>Question No. 512 answered with Question No. 509.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":1115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS04850"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[3719\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800069#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has supported or ever received a request from Dublin City Council for repairs to a community centre (details supplied) in Dublin 11 where pyrite has been discovered.

Procurement by Irish Water of external resources is a matter for the company and I have no role in approving individual contracts. <\/p><p>  However, data supplied by Irish Water indicate that an open tender competition was conducted in 2010 to appoint a service provider to provide services in relation to organisation structure, governance and capabilities arising from the unbundling of BGE's energy business from its networks business. Following an initial shortlisting of candidates through a pre-qualification process, four tenders were received for this contract. The identity of the unsuccessful tenderers is confidential information. The most economically advantageous tender was awarded the contract with cost having a 35% weighting among the criteria for purposes of the award.<\/p><p>  The impact of the establishment of Irish Water within the BGE group could not be technically or economically separated from the initial contract awarded to Accenture and it was necessary for Accenture to give consideration to the establishment of a new subsidiary on organisation structure, governance and capabilities in the implementation of unbundling. <\/p><p>  The services relating to the establishment of Irish Water commenced on 10 May 2012.

The performance of the services took place over a period of 12 weeks up to 31 July 2012 for a fixed fee of &euro;398,689 (excluding VAT) and expenses of &euro;16,500. In August 2012, a requirement arose for related services for programme management and data strategy and integration. These services were drawn down under the 2011 contract with Accenture. The services commenced on 27 August 2012 and concluded on 23 October 2012 and were for a fixed fee of &euro;220,000 excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  The initial mobilisation period of 12 weeks was an aggressive timeframe.

The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. <\/p><p>  I have already, this year, indicated a return to modest levels of new social housing construction. Over the next few months, I intend to announce some 1,000 new house starts across the voluntary, local authority and regeneration housing work programmes for 2014\/2015. Last week, my Department requested local authorities to submit proposals by 28 March for new construction and acquisition projects under the Capital Assistance Scheme over the next two years. I intend to announce details of the new social housing construction programme for local authorities shortly. I also intend to announce details of a special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses to make these available to households in need of social housing. <\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. <\/p><p>  The Social Housing Leasing Initiative offers an effective and efficient response to housing need, taking account not just of the availability of resources but also market conditions and the need for a broader range of more flexible delivery mechanisms. To the end of December 2013, 4,600 social housing units have been delivered under the leasing initiative. It is expected that this initiative will continue to provide substantial numbers of social housing units in the years ahead. <\/p><p>  In addition, my Department , the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing and, in particular, having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment.  It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available. <\/p><p>  By the end of December 2013, some 2,055 units have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing with the overall total delivery of social housing from NAMA sourced units standing at 596 (completed or contracted) since the process began. Further information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county of units delivered by quarter, is available at the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website:  . <\/p><p>  In spite of the financial constraints within which we are required to operate, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800070#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects Expenditure","counter":1145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800070#WRT02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1146,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[3786\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800070#WRT02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the &euro;800 million spent on the Ballymun regeneration project to date.","asker":"1022","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1147,"content":"<p> Over the period 1999 to date, over &euro;755 million has been recouped by my Department to Ballymun Regeneration Limited (BRL) in respect of the physical, social and economic regeneration of Ballymun.<\/p><p>  This has facilitated the construction of over 1,800 replacement homes in Ballymun.

These obligations apply to all sectors of the housing market, including the self-build sector.<\/p><p>  Neither the Building Control Act or any regulations thereunder, including the new Building Control Regulations , place any restrictions on whom an owner may assign as a builder once the owner is satisfied that the builder is competent to undertake the works involved. An owner who intends to self-build will assume responsibility for ensuring that building or works concerned will comply with the requirements of the second schedule to the building regulations. They must undertake to do everything necessary to achieve this and to ensure they are in a position to certify the building or works on completion thereby taking legal responsibility as builder. The new regulations also require an owner to assign a competent, registered professional to certify the design prior to commencement and to inspect the works during construction so that the assigned certifier is in a position, in conjunction with the owner-builder, to sign a certificate of compliance on completion. A   building project cannot proceed until such assignment s   (which may be one and the same person) have been made. Confidence in the builder will be a key factor influencing a professional&rsquo;s decision on accepting a role as assigned certifier , in particular, and owners who intend to self-build will need to be aware of this.<\/p><p>  My Department will be happy to liaise with the Irish Association of Self-Builders   in relation to their concerns and to assist them in understanding their obligations in the context of the new regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Status","counter":1184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[3948\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the plans of Irish Water including the projected timelines for commencement and completion for the construction of a new main drainage scheme in Bandon, County Cork.","asker":"994","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[4134\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the progress of a scheme (details supplied); if he will further provide assurances that this scheme will proceed as planned; if the funding that was approved for this project is still in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1187,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[4150\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has addressed the concerns of Bandon Town Council in their letter to him dated 28 November 2013 (details supplied); if these works will proceed as planned during 2014; if funding is still in place to complete the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1188,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545, 552 and 555 together.<\/p><p>  Contracts for both a wastewater treatment plant upgrade, and network for the Bandon Sewerage Scheme, Phase 2, were included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013   among the contracts to start during that period. <\/p><p>  In February 2012 I approved funding of &euro;3.9 m for the network contract on the scheme; Cork County Council awarded the contract in March 2012 and the Contractor commenced work at that time.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. <\/p><p>  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. <\/p><p>  In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. In 2014, funding of over &euro;587 million is being made available across a range of housing programmes. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. When this is taken into account, funding for housing for 2014 is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  My Department has requested local authorities to submit proposals by 28 March 2014 for new construction and acquisition projects under the Capital Assistance Scheme over the next two years. With the benefit of the additional capital for new housing construction, I intend to announce details of a new social housing construction programme for local authorities for the period 2014 to 2015. I expect that up to 600 new social and voluntary homes will be delivered under these measures. I also intend to announce details of a special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses to bring these back into productive use. I expect that this measure will deliver some 400 homes for persons in need of social housing.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In addition, my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing and, in particular, having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment. It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available. <\/p><p>In spite of the financial constraints within which we are required to operate, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":1200,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[4064\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800071#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total amount of social houses available here; if he will provide a breakdown on a county basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1201,"content":"<p>The Eighth Annual Report on Service Indicators, published by the Local Government Management Services Board in April 2013 , which details service indicators in local authorities in 2011, provides a range of information in relation to the social housing stock including the total number of dwellings in each local authority area.

However, by way of general information, I can say that the primary purpose of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is to reform the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies (OMCs) which are the bodies established for the management of such areas. <\/p><p>  Section 5 of the Act contains provisions which deal with completed or substantially completed multi-unit developments in which the common areas have not been transferred to the OMCs. They oblige the developer to transfer ownership of the relevant parts of the common areas to the relevant OMC within 6 months of the coming into operation of the section, i.e. before 1 October 2011. Subsection (2) defines &quot;substantially completed&quot; as developments in which sales of not less than 80% of the residential units have been closed.  <\/p><p>  Section 24 deals with the resolution of disputes and it provides that a person may apply to court for an order to enforce any right conferred or obligation imposed by the Act.  The court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation in respect of the development concerned.<\/p><p>  Statutory provisions regarding the liabilities and responsibilities of companies in liquidation, including their debts and any judgments registered against them, are set out in the Companies Acts rather than the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  However, since title to a residential unit in a multi-unit development normally comprises both ownership of the unit concerned and a corresponding share of ownership of the development's common areas, the validity of registration of a judgment mortgage over such common areas is a matter on which, taking account of the owners' title documents, the OMC may wish to obtain legal advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800072#WRV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":1277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800072#WRV03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1278,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[3667\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800072#WRV03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the age profile of female prisoners currently incarcerated in the State.

This Order imposed, subject to a small number of exceptions, a registration requirement on foreign nationals which included a requirement to provide fingerprints when so required by a registration officer. The limited number of exceptions to the registration requirement includes those aged under 16 years and those whose visit is for a period of not more than three months.  Since that time the registration process, including the fingerprint requirement, has been preserved, in respect of non-EEA nationals, in subsequent legislation, most recently in the Immigration Act 2004.<\/p><p>  The obligations on a non-national to register are set out in section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004 and pursuant to section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2004, a non national is required to furnish certain particulars to a Registration Officer for the Registration District in which he or she is resident. These particulars are set out in the <i>Second Schedule<\/i>, to the Act of 2004. Paragraph 11 of the said Schedule sets out a requirement regarding the provision of &ldquo;signature and fingerprints&rdquo;, if required by the Registration Officer.<\/p><p>  It is generally recognised internationally that taking of fingerprints, or other biometric identifiers, is an essential and reliable method of verification and a key technology in efforts to combat identity fraud and to enhance the security and integrity of documentation such as the registration certificate issued to a non-national on completion of the registration process.<\/p><p>  For this purpose, and following an expansion of the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the taking of fingerprints in the process of registration of non-nationals, commenced in 2008.<\/p><p>  Fingerprints are stored on the AFIS database which is housed in a secure location in a Garda facility.  Access to the AFIS database itself is controlled by use of passwords and access controls and a full audit trail is kept of all transactions associated with the AFIS system.  All passwords are managed and controlled and comply with international and industry standards.<\/p><p>  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding in respect of the taking of fingerprints of people who become naturalised citizens, it is the case that significant numbers of these including all children under sixteen years of age and any non-national born in Ireland are not required to register and as such are not fingerprinted.<\/p><p>  In relation to the disposal of fingerprints, while there are no specific provisions contained in current legislation in respect of registered non-nationals, provision is made for the destruction of fingerprints taken from foreign nationals, for immigration related reasons, in the Immigration Residence &amp;amp; Protection Bill. Specifically in relation to persons who acquire citizenship, the Bill provides for the destruction of biometric data not later than one month of becoming an Irish citizen or a citizen of a Member State of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800073#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Remuneration","counter":1318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800073#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1319,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[4159\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800073#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of semi-State companies under the remit of his Department that have paid bonuses their its employees in 2011, 2012 and 2013; if he will identify these semi-State companies; the number of employees and the level of bonuses paid; his views on the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1320,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to semi-State bodies who have a significant element of commercial or trade activities within their remit.

In 2013 a total of 1,734 members of the AR and NSR availed of paid training and utilised 23,898 paid training mandays.<\/p><p>  A Value for Money (VFM) Review of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) was published in November 2012.  It set out a number of recommendations aimed at improving the capacity of the RDF and at ensuring a viable and cost effective Reserve into the future. The implementation of these recommendations is ongoing and, in this context, the AR and NSR underwent a major re-organisation in 2013. Gratuities for members of the AR and NSR have been withdrawn and the budget was been re-allocated to ensure that there are sufficient funds to provide a minimum of seven days paid training for all reservists. This has increased the number of paid training days available from approximately 30,000 mandays in 2012 to 41,500 mandays in 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>  The uptake of paid and unpaid training by members of the AR and NSR was critically examined in the VFM Review.  It highlighted a poor uptake of paid training with regard to the reported effective strength. This has an adverse effect on the overall capacity of Units. The military authorities are actively identifying Reservists who do not meet training requirements and, in line with regulations, these Reservists will be posted as non-effective.  This will ensure that posts currently blocked by inactive Reservists will be freed up and filled.

I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. <\/p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I am working with BIM to endeavour to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  <\/p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  <\/p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring with BIM to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800074#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800074#WRX01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1396,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[3806\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800074#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has their single farm payment reduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1397,"content":"<p>With regards to the Single Payments Scheme, the reduction in question is due to the application of Financial Discipline.

I also informed both groups that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  In this connection, at the last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June 2013, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. I am glad to note that this agreement has been welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800076#WRY02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":1479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800076#WRY02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1480,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[4317\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800076#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of REP scheme 4 will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1481,"content":"<p>The person named commenced REPS 4 in June 2009 and received payments for the first four years of their contract.<\/p><p>  REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.

Outside the greater Dublin area the service is provided through the Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS). <\/p><p>  The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years.  Where necessary, the social worker arranges for a foster care or residential placement for the child until the next working day. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours e.g. Garda&iacute;, hospital and ambulance service personnel. <\/p><p>  The Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) operates outside the greater Dublin area and allows Garda&iacute; to access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours.

As part of this service Garda&iacute; have access to advice and information from a social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.   The purpose of this service is to provide placements to children where Garda&iacute; have removed children from their homes under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, outside of normal working hours, on an emergency basis or where a young person presents themselves as needing care and protection. <\/p><p>  There has been a steady increase in the number of calls to the CIS and EPSS and an increase in the number of children placed since its commencement.

Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis.

These data provide information on the number of patients vaccinated with influenza vaccine (by age group and HSE-Area of residence), attendance at GP clinics and pharmacies for vaccination and the number of registered medical and GP visit cardholders aged 65 years and older.  The number of patients vaccinated with influenza vaccine refers to GP and pharmacy paid claims for influenza vaccination reported by the PCRS and so are dependent on GPs&rsquo; and pharmacist&rsquo;s claims for reimbursement.  Data from pharmacies are only available for the 2012\/2013 influenza season when administration of influenza vaccine by pharmacists commenced.<\/p><p>  As highlighted, the uptake of influenza vaccine in those aged 65 years and older<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  decreased from 70% in the 2008\/2009 to  56.9% in 2011\/2012.  These estimates are based on PCRS data received by HPSC.  The uptake in the season 2008\/2009 was the highest uptake reported.  The reason for this decline is unknown but as previously stated may be due to data received by PCRS which is dependent on GPs&rsquo; and pharmacist&rsquo;s claims for reimbursement.  Data from pharmacies were only available for the 2012\/2013 influenza season when administration of influenza vaccine by pharmacists commenced which may have influenced 2011\/2012 season data.  In addition, during the period 2011\/2012 data reported were not complete as PCRS did not report vaccinations administered by GPs and claimed through the new vaccination claiming system.  The 2012\/2013 dataset is not fully complete from PCRS and it may improve when the complete dataset is received.  In 2008\/2009 there were a number of high profile avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks in UK and other European countries.  It is also possible that the higher uptake noted that year reflected a mistaken belief that seasonal influenza vaccine would protect against H5N1 avian influenza. <\/p><p>  Of note is that a national telephone survey undertaken after the 2012\/2013 influenza season measuring influenza vaccine uptake reports 59.9% coverage (provisional data) in those aged 65 years and over which is similar to the uptake recorded in the previous season i.e. 2011\/2012 season.  This survey also explored the reasons for non-vaccination among respondents.<\/p><p>  Respondents in the age group 65 years and over perceived themselves as not needing the influenza vaccine and of not being at risk of contracting influenza.  In those who were vaccinated, recommendation by the GP was a strong predictor of influenza vaccination. <\/p><p>  As pointed out the influenza vaccine coverage in this age group is below the WHO target of 75% and this is of concern. Efforts to improve flu vaccine uptake in those aged 65 years and older are made annually by launching the influenza vaccination campaign (media and written materials by the National Immunisation Office) at the start of the influenza season.  In addition, HSE areas communicate to all nursing homes and residential care units at the start of each flu season regarding the importance of improving influenza vaccine uptake among elderly residents.  <\/p><p><b>Table 1: <\/b>  Cumulative percentage seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in Medical Card Holders aged 65 years and older by season (September &ndash; August), attending GP clinics.<table><tr><th>Sept - August<\/th><th><div>2011\/12<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010\/11<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009\/10<\/div><\/th><th><div>2008\/09<\/div><\/th><th><div>2007\/08<\/div><\/th><th><div>2006\/07<\/div><\/th><th><div>2005\/06<\/div><\/th><th><div>2004\/05<\/div><\/th><th><div>Mean<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>No. vaccinated<\/td><td><div>250,525<\/div><\/td><td><div>276,240<\/div><\/td><td><div>225,358<\/div><\/td><td><div>294,156<\/div><\/td><td><div>259,100<\/div><\/td><td><div>246,695<\/div><\/td><td><div>249,013<\/div><\/td><td><div>236,425<\/div><\/td><td><div>254,689.0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No. Medical card holders *<\/td><td><div>444,628<\/div><\/td><td><div>432,650<\/div><\/td><td><div>419,010<\/div><\/td><td><div>419,327<\/div><\/td><td><div>419,767<\/div><\/td><td><div>407,196<\/div><\/td><td><div>395,458<\/div><\/td><td><div>385,162<\/div><\/td><td><div>415,400<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>% Uptake<\/td><td><div>56.3<\/div><\/td><td><div>63.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>53.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>70.1<\/div><\/td><td><div>61.7<\/div><\/td><td><div>60.6<\/div><\/td><td><div>63.0<\/div><\/td><td><div>61.4<\/div><\/td><td><div>61.3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><br \/>The number of Medical card holders includes GP visit card holders and represents the <b>average<\/b>   number of card holders for the period September 2011 - August 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800077#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1545,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[3490\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800077#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason flu vaccination rates for Irish persons with chronic medical conditions-risk groups were just below 29% in 2009-2010 - the most recent available data - compared to 70% in the Netherlands; and the reason vaccination rates among health care workers here reached only 18% in 2011-12, down from 26.5% in 2009-10. ","asker":"1091","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1546,"content":"<p>I am informed by the HSE that provisional data from the National Telephone Survey 2013 indicates that among those in the age group 18 - 64 years, with chronic medical conditions, self-reported influenza uptake for the 2012 - 2013 season was 28.4%.  There has been little change from uptake in this group previously reported from the National Telephone Survey undertaken in 2010 (for the 2009 - 2010 season).  In general, data from previous surveys has found that low uptake among groups recommended vaccine is based on lack of self-perceived risk and need for vaccination.  A GP or clinician recommending influenza vaccine is a predictor of vaccine acceptance (source: National Telephone Survey 2010).<\/p><p>  Based on data from a European survey (VENICE II survey, 2011 - 2012 influenza season), only three of 28 EU member states (UK, the Netherlands, France) were able to provide administrative data relating to influenza immunisation among individuals with clinical risk (aged 6 months - 64 years).  The influenza vaccine uptake in this group ranged from 29.7% (France) to 73.6% (the Netherlands).  An additional three countries provided survey based data for that season (Portugal, Norway and France).  The range of uptake was 31% (Portugal) to 45.6% (France- estimated based on a number of surveys).<\/p><p>  Possible reasons for higher uptake in the Netherlands may be related to the fact that both vaccine and vaccine administration are free for all, whereas in Ireland although the vaccine is free for all, those individuals without medical or GP only cards are required to pay for administration.  It is well documented in international literature that payment for preventive care services (such as vaccination) negatively impacts on vaccination uptake.  Additionally, the Netherlands uses computerised medical records to estimate uptake among risk groups.  Ireland does not have information systems with which to routinely identify those at risk for vaccination and to monitor uptake among this group. <\/p><p>  The most recent data on seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among Health Care workers (HCWs) is   from HPSC.  Overall in 2012 - 2013 the percentage uptake among HCWs as reported by participating hospitals was 17.4% (range 10.1% - 27.8%), a slight decrease from 18.0% reported in 2011 - 2012).  However, data from the National Telephone Survey 2013 found that self-reported vaccine uptake among HCW participants of 29.5%, suggesting that the data provided by hospitals may be incomplete and not accurately reflect uptake among HCWs, some of whom may obtain vaccination outside the occupational health care department (and therefore not reported by occupational health statistics).   <\/p><p>  During the current 2013 - 2014 influenza season HSE is working to improve uptake among HCWs in the hospitals and other health care settings.  Based on provisional data from HPSC (for October 2013 - January 2014) the estimated uptake among hospital HCWs is 18.1%, and among HCWs in long term care facilities is 22.8%.  The slight increase reported in this current season most likely reflects the increased attention and promotion to vaccination within the HSE health care facilities (hospitals and long term care facilities).  The data for the complete season will be available following the final request for uptake figures made at the end of the season (May 2014). <\/p><p>  Internationally, achieving high influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs is seen as challenging.  Within Europe recent data (VENICE II survey, 2011 - 2012 influenza season) reported a wide inter-country variation of influenza vaccine coverage among HCWs, range 6.4% (Poland) to 54.4% (Romania).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800077#WRZ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":1547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800077#WRZ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1548,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[3491\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800077#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to extend the provision of additional services in primary care centres to deliver more medical treatment at community level and ease pressure in public hospitals; and if he will outline the types of services that could be extended to these centres","asker":"1091","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1549,"content":"<p>The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health system and is a key element of the overall Health Reform Programme.

However, existing resources need to be re-shaped, and the priority now is to achieve this at local level, in line with similar  mental health service initiatives elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Currently, there are 35 acute psychiatric beds in Galway city, and 22 acute psychiatric beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon. This gives a total of 79 beds, serving a population of some 315,000. <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>   recommends 50 beds for a catchment population of 300,000.  It is clear therefore, in line with policy and operational norms nationally, that the provision of 22 beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon means that the current overall stock of 79 in HSE West is too high in relative terms, allied to a corresponding under-development of community based mental health services.<\/p><p>  In the context of the service improvements now underway, a purpose built 50 bed acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015, to replace the existing smaller unit. This Unit will consist of 35 general adult mental health beds, with the remaining 15 beds relating to psychiatry of later life, eating disorders, and mental health and intellectual disability. The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds.<\/p><p>  The proposed re-organisation of services, following a detailed assessment by HSE West, will provide for a total of 57 general adult mental health beds. This will be a sufficient number of acute psychiatric beds in line with<i> A Vision for Change , <\/i>  and will also allow the HSE to enhance community based services through re-deployment of some staff from acute services. Arising from an appropriate consultation process, staff from St. Brigid&rsquo;s will be redeployed on a phased basis to both community mental health teams in Ballinasloe and to acute services in Galway and Roscommon. There will be no impact for current in-patients in Ballinasloe, and bed reduction will take place on a phased basis.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the decision taken by the Executive, based on expert recommendations, to enhance future mental health provision in the area is the best option, taking account of overall service needs and competing resource priorities. The approach and objectives to bring about service change in this case is no different to that undertaken, or planned, elsewhere to implement a widely agreed policy on improving mental health services.

My decision on these appointments to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal was not influenced by financial data or consultants' reports.  <\/p><p>  Under Sections 10 and 11 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act l997, the Department of Finance established two Special Accounts to meet the costs of the Tribunal.  The Hepatitis C Compensation Scheme is a demand led scheme and it can be difficult to accurately estimate future payments within calendar years.  While the accounts of the Tribunal may show a surplus or a deficit from year to year, this reflects the demand arising and Vote accounting timing issues within particular calendar years.<\/p><p>  The format of the Annual Report for the Tribunal was changed in 2010 but all the information contained in previous Annual Reports was retained.  In the printed copy of the 2011 Annual Report the legal costs are presented as in previous Reports.  However, the 2011 Annual Report as placed on the website  of the Tribunal  inadvertently placed the legal costs within the Reparation Fund heading.  This was subsequently amended to reflect the printed publication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":1638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1639,"qnumday":709,"qnumall":"[3782\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount paid in compensation over the past three years by the Health Service Executive either through the courts or by settlement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1640,"content":"<p>I have referred this matter to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Eligibility","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[3783\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the eligibility for a mobility grant in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Response Times","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[3787\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800079#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the locations of each of the three ambulances that were available in the Drogheda area at 1.46 a.m. on 1 January 2014 when the first emergency call was received in respect of the stabbing of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a national programme of reconfiguring therapy resources for children with disabilities, including autism, with a view to ensuring there is more equitable access to services for children, according to their individual needs.  Established since 2010, the national re-configuration programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Disability Services for Children aged 5-18.  <\/i>A key objective of the HSE's <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme<\/i><i>(0-18 years<\/i> ) is to ensure there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay.  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them.<\/p><p>  A fundamental principle underlying the Programme is that children should receive the health services they need as close to their home and school as possible.  Some children may have their needs met by their local primary care services.  An Early Intervention Team and a School Age Team will look after all children with more complex needs in a defined geographic network area, regardless of the nature of their disability.  These Teams will be supported by specialist services in areas requiring a high level of expertise.  The Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate while also recognising a continuing role for special schools. <\/p><p>  The specific issue of waiting times for therapy services, including speech and language therapy, is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive.

","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1726,"content":"<p>The prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.  In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland.  These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.  The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply.  In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicinal products.  Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 groups of medicinal products, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.<\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013.  The List has been updated since then by the addition of 12 more groups of  medicinal products.  The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the first top 20 priority groups of medicinal products by end Quarter 1 2014.  A second list of 20 priority groups of medicinal products has now been identified and it is expected the IMB will have completed assessment of these products in Quarter 4 2014.  Details on when each group of medicinal products will be assessed for interchangeability will be published on the IMB website in due course (www.imb.ie).<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 resulting in a 70% reduction in the price paid by the HSE for these products compared to May 2013.  The second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014 and the HSE expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg on 1 February 2014 resulting in a 56% reduction in the price of these products compared to May 2013.  The HSE also expect to implement reference prices for rosuvastatin products with effect from 1 February 2014 resulting in a 40% reduction compared to the prices paid in May 2013.<\/p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin.  It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014.  The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation.  It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014 resulting in further significant reductions in the price of generic medicines.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1728,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[3962\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the level of ambulance cover in County Mayo on 29 and 30 June and 10, 21 and 28 July 2013; the way this level of cover compared to other dates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of Form E112 (IE).  A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.  The cost of the treatment is not a deciding factor when approving an application.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.<\/p><p>  The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment, in a public hospital, in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:<blockquote><i>(a) The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>(b) following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following:<\/i><i>- They recommend the patient be treated in another EU\/EEA country or Switzerland;<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>- The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>- The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>- The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>- The hospital outside the state will accept EU\/EEA form E112 (IE).<\/i><\/blockquote>  and wish to confirm that applications for the Treatment Abroad Scheme are assessed on a case by case basis. <\/p><p>  The HSE TAS processes applications on the basis of the treatment that the patient is being referred outside the state to receive, which is not available in Ireland.  The presence of a rare illness, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, is not of itself criteria for availing of treatment abroad: most rare diseases are treated without the need for recourse to services in other jurisdictions.  Patients, in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant, have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112.  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  Approved applicants\/patients' hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode of care. Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.<\/p><p>  Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form.  Each application to TAS is processed and given a formal written decision.  If that decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded.  Furthermore, as above the decision on an application does not restrict future applications for an individual patient or indeed other patients seeking treatment abroad that is not available in Ireland.<\/p><p>  It is not possible to give a &quot;blanket&quot; statement on application s to TAS for patients with a particular condition, not least in relation to EDS where its presentation differs from patient to patient. As outlined above, applications are made in respect of a specified treatment not available in Ireland.  The above is by way of providing foreground to the answer to Deputy McGrath's direct question.  With regard to same, the HSE TAS does not encompass a list of specific treatments which are covered under the scheme.  As above, each individual application is processed on its own merits and without the submission and of review of an application, no decision regarding a specific case can be given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Training","counter":1754,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1755,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[4054\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will support a matter (details supplied) regarding training allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1756,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":1757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1758,"qnumday":752,"qnumall":"[4060\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800080#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the suggested relationship between breast cancer screening and incidence (details supplied).

A review notification will indicate that either a self assessment is completed by the card holder themselves or request that the card holder return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings, and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.<\/p><p>  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been received at that point. If a person does not return their review form within the time specified, their continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and their medical card\/GP visit card cannot be reissued. In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.<\/p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms, at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and\/or to get back to the person if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be provided. <\/p><p>  A person (and their dependants, if it applies), the subject of a medical card\/GP visit card eligibility review assessment, will continue to have their eligibility extended pending the outcome of a review assessment, provided <\/p><p>  1. they have returned their review form within the time specified, and <\/p><p>  2. are engaging with the HSE in enabling their review assessment to complete. <\/p><p>  The medical card\/GP visit card holder does not need to take any action other than genuinely co-operate with the review process and communicate with the HSE on an ongoing basis throughout the process. If the HSE is made aware that a person has a disability or special needs, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the review application and explain the support documentation they need to send. The local health office can be contacted or LoCall 1890 252 919 to request this assistance.<\/p><p>  A medical card\/GP visit card holder who genuinely engages with the review will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. <\/p><p>  In addition, GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards\/medical cards, and subsequently the following month, and the month after that, if the patient has not returned their review form by that time.   <\/p><p>  GPs have full electronic visibility of their GP visit\/medical card panel of patients and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate, or where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medial card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.   <\/p><p>  The HSE also undertakes reviews of medical card\/GP visit card eligibility, whereby selected cardholders are asked to confirm that they are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Being ordinarily resident in Ireland is a prerequisite for medical card\/GP visit card eligibility.  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month and the cardholder is asked to sign and return to the HSE a Declaration of Residency form.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. The Government having considered this matter, announced, as part of Budget 2014, that it will commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800081#WRDD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":1788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800081#WRDD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1789,"qnumday":762,"qnumall":"[4127\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800081#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received complaints regarding the national communications director of the Health Service Executive which alleges behaviour that seeks to silence or intimidate medical columnists who are highlighting issues of genuine public concern (details supplied);\u00a0if he has acted to investigate and resolve the issue; the actions taken by the national communications director regarding this article; if the director acted on his own or was he directed to do so; if the actions of the director are condoned by him; and the repercussions, if any, for the director with regard to his actions.

Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.<\/p><p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support\/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in last June.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.<\/p><p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is a college\/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.<\/p><p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.

Appointments may not necessarily be from the applications received through the advertising process, which is also in line with the Government Decision. The first advertising campaign was launched by my Department in January 2012, and there have been 30 advertising campaigns to date.<\/p><p>  There were some exceptions to the advertising process in 2012 and 2013.  In 2012, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal were appointed by me, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.  Another exception was in the case of some boards, particularly hospital boards, where the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.<\/p><p>  A protocol was devised in  my Department in 2012 and agreed with the Public Appointments Service (PAS), and this is applied in relation to the process for appointments to bodies under the aegis of my Department.  Notice of vacancies on boards is provided 6 months in advance of that vacancy to allow my officials consult with PAS in a timely fashion on the advertising process.   It involves devising a competency assessment of candidates who express an interest in becoming a member of a board.   During 2013, because of difficulties in concluding the appointments to boards that had been advertised through the PAS  process, expressions of interest for membership of the Medical Council were not advertised on the PAS website, but were advertised on my Department's website.  <\/p><p>  With regard to board fees, there are four categories payable to chairpersons and directors of Non-Commercial State Agencies. The &ldquo;one person one salary&rdquo; principle provides that public servants acting as chairpersons or directors of state-sponsored bodies do not receive additional remuneration for undertaking such duties.    Members of Boards are entitled to claim travel and subsistence as governed by the Travel and Subsistence Circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Instead of the fees mentioned above, members of the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal are paid a briefing fee of &euro;10,000 when they take up their appointment and a daily rate of &euro;845.00.<\/p><p>  The approved annual rates in respect of those Boards to which I have made appointments and where  board fees are payable are:<\/p><p><b><i>Category - Chair - Director<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>1 - &euro;29,888 - &euro;14,963<\/p><p>2 - &euro;20,520 - &euro;11,970<\/p><p>3 - &euro;11,970 - &euro;7,695<\/p><p>4 - &euro;8,978 - &euro;5,985<\/p><p>The boards for which fees are currently paid to members are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Category 1 Boards<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>N\/A<\/p><p><b><i>Category 2 Boards<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>HIQA, VHI<\/p><p><b><i>Category 3 Boards<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board, Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, National Treatment Purchase Fund, Health Research Board, Medical Council, Mental Health Commission, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.<\/p><p><b><i>Category 4 Boards<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>Health &amp;amp; Social Care Professionals Council (Chair only), Health Insurance Authority.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that existing board members, and members appointed in the future are given the option to waive the related board fee on a discretionary basis.<\/p><p>  Information will be provided as quickly as possible to the Deputy on  the actual  number of appointments from March 2011 to December 2013, where I as Minister have nominating rights,  number of positions publicly advertised and the number of posts not advertised, but directly appointed by me or my predecessor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800082#WREE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":1853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800082#WREE01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":790,"qnumall":"[4609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012800082#WREE01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the level of pro bono work provided by legal, accountancy and consulting firms in the past 24 months to his Department; which of those firms have also been awarded State contracts by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
