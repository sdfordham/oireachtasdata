In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy with 5.7% of heat demand being met from renewable sources.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that most of the 12% renewable heat target will be achieved through the use of biomass technologies. In this regard, the uptake of combined heat and power under REFIT 3, along with the migration by certain heat users to renewable heat in response to market forces, will make a contribution to achieving the target. The requirements of Part L of the Building regulations are also expected to make a contribution to increasing the uptake of renewable heat. <\/p>  <p>  However, progress towards the renewable heat target is proving to be challenging and analysis by the Sustanable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) suggests that in the absence of additional measures a shortfall in the region of 2 to 4 percentage points could emerge in the heat sector. This would represent between 1 and 2 percentage points in terms of the overall renewable energy target. Any shortfall in meeting the 16% target for 2020 would need to be addressed by purchasing \"renewable energy credits\" from another EU Member State. While the cost of such credits has yet to be established, the SEAI has estimated that it could be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per percentage point shortfall. There could also be penalties associated with any shortfall. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis underpinning the Draft Bioenergy Plan, published in October last year, indicates that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals including reducing the potential shortfall in our renewable heat levels.

","asker":"1082","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 65 and 96 together.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to assure the Deputies that the Government is totally committed to maintaining and strengthening MABS and its local delivery of services.  While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputies that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  <\/p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and\/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration. Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only. All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected. Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before. The proposed option could provide a structure to ensure that advice and input in relation to local issues continues and for networking to maintain local connections.  It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services.

The total paid in respect of rent supplement in 2014 was &euro;338 million. Data in relation to the number of rent supplement tenancies and new tenancies created for the first quarter in each of the last five years is provided in the attached tabular statement.<\/p><p>The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie. The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.<\/p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Kildare area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance. Of the 1,000 recipients mentioned above, over 530 households in Dublin and some 14 in Cork city have been provided assistance through increased rent limits under the Protocol.<\/p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation. The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty. I can assure the Deputies that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.<\/p><p>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. Recent figures shows that payments direct to nominated payees are made in approximately 20% of cases. A breakdown of expenditure data under rent supplement for nominated payments is not available.<\/p><p>It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every effort is made to prevent overpayments, but if they occur, they are regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort is made to recover the amounts due.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement<\/b><\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement Tenancies<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Tenancies at End 1st Quarter<\/th><th>New Tenancies <sup>1<\/sup>1st Quarter<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>97,288<\/td><td>10,311<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>94,990<\/td><td>7,607<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>86,375<\/td><td>6,571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>77,731<\/td><td>5,188<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>69,793<\/td><td>3,723<\/td><\/tr><\/table><sup>1<\/sup>Refers to cases that were not awarded at the end of the previous quarter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800061#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":159,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800061#WRC02550"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[16345\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800061#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when carer's allowance will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare in respect of that person's child who has ongoing special needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the spouse of the person in question on 5th March 2013.

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of  right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment. For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another. Similarly, there will be many contributors who would not require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  <\/p>  <p>  The social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.<\/p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, that is, one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published in 2012 found that Fund has a strong redistributive nature. This is demonstrated by the fact that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes and the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800063#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[16806\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800064#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will take steps to ensure that appropriate credits are provided for persons who had to leave the workforce due to the marriage bar in the early 1970s, as this is having an impact upon their ability to receive appropriate pensions at this point in time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>The &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo;, a requirement that women leave paid employment on entering marriage, was a condition of employment within most sectors of the public service until 1973.  A number of private sector employers operated similar restrictions at that time, generally in respect of &lsquo;white collar&rsquo; positions, notably in the financial sector.  The marriage bar was abolished in the public service in 1973, and similar provisions in the private sector were made illegal in 1977, by legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment on grounds of sex.  <\/p>  <p>  Issues relating to public sector employment and pensions are the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In general, civil and public servants recruited at that time paid a modified rate of PRSI (i.e. not the full Class A rate) which gave coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions, occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit only. It did not provide cover for the State pension.   The modified rate of social insurance was a condition of employment for public servants at that time. Accordingly, even if those affected by the marriage bar in the public service had continued in employment, contributions paid at this rate would not have given entitlement to a State pension (contributory) under the social welfare system. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate how many women in the private sector faced an equivalent requirement to leave their jobs upon marriage, nor how many of these would then have taken up employment with other employers that had no such policy.  At that time equivalents to the current jobseeker's benefit and allowance schemes were available to persons suffering the contingency of unemployment in a manner similar to that which exist today and there were provisions whereby persons not entitled to benefit or assistance could protect their social insurance record via credited contributions. <\/p>  <p>  Information provided to workers at the time clearly notified them with regard to the provision of credits, and persons leaving employment were also advised of the potential to continue making social insurance contributions via the voluntary contributions system.  Credits would generally only have been available to persons who were available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied. These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If someone has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory). Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800064#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800064#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[16832\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800064#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath; if same will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>In order to determine the circumstances of the person concerned, his file was forwarded to his local Social Welfare Inspector.

There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme.  Rather, when a DB scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in each schemes Trust Deeds and Rules.  The Trust Deeds and Rules differ from scheme to scheme, and as with any contractual situation, reflect the parameters on the level of obligation of the parties involved.  <\/p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme are required under the Pensions Act, to maintain sufficient assets in a defined benefit pension scheme to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of a scheme.

As you aware, this process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.

The Limerick revaluation will\u00a0mean a reduction in the rates liability for 65% of ratepayers in that area.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the\u00a0Limerick revaluation has led to large increases in the valuation of wind farms which could, subject to appeal, see the rates liability on those wind farms rise by c.200%.  Wind farms in other counties are not directly impacted by this revaluation.  I am also aware of the calls for the amendment to the Valuation Act 2001 referred to in the question.  The potential impact on the sector, of the revaluation in Limerick\u00a0was raised at both D&aacute;il Committee and Report Stages of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which has since been enacted.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001 provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  I understand that appeals on the Limerick revaluations have been lodged with the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions and I, as Minister, have no function in the valuation of property for rates purposes or in an appeal.  This includes expressing a view on the  valuation of one type of property compared to another.  This is a matter for the qualified staff of the independent Commissioner of Valuation which can be tested using the appeals processes provided.  It is important to allow the independent process of valuation and appeal to take its course before a full assessment can be undertaken or any other actions considered, including whether the proposed amendment mentioned by the Deputy would be appropriate or necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 23rd April 2015. While there were calls to delay the passage of the Bill to allow further consideration of the issue raised, the main objective of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 is to accelerate the revaluation programme. It would not have\u00a0been fair on ratepayers in counties that\u00a0have yet to be revalued to delay measures that will accelerate this process while\u00a0we await the outcome of appeals and further consideration of the impact of the revaluation on one sector.  As was stated in\u00a0both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad\u00a0it is acknowledged that the revaluation has implications for the Wind Energy sector and, if after a full analysis of the situation post appeal, a legislative change is considered necessary, then appropriate\u00a0consideration\u00a0can be given to the matter at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800066#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Levy","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800066#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[16466\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800066#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he will remove the pension levy currently imposed on retired teachers (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>It is understood that the\u00a0Deputy's question refers to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which came into effect on 1 January 2011 by way of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, and which has since been amended via the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The PSPR applies to qualifying public service pensions of\u00a0public service retirees\u00a0generally, including retired teachers. PSPR reduces the value of those qualifying public service pensions.  It is a progressively structured measure, and as such takes account of the position of persons in receipt of modest-sized pensions.  Specifically in this regard,\u00a0all pensions below &euro;12,000 are exempt from PSPR, while pensions below &euro;32,500 are exempt from additional PSPR\u00a0measures legislated for in 2013 via the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  In addition, for those pensions which are affected by PSPR, the reduction is proportionately greater for higher-value pensions than for lower-value pensions.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I am required to review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As part of that review I consider whether the various measures, including the PSPR, continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation.  In my most recent report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2014 I concluded that the continuation of the PSPR remained necessary.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the economic and fiscal conditions move towards a more sustainable position, I believe it will be necessary to prepare for an orderly wind-down of the financial emergency legislation.

In addition IDA has developed a major land bank at Mullagharlin to the south of the town of Dundalk.  This extends to 150 acres in two parcels of 110 acres and 40 acres respectively.  These lands currently have valid planning permission in place for an Advance Biopharmaceutical and Knowledge Industry Campus which will support biopharmaceutical administration, research and support activities.  The planning permission is valid until 2018.<\/p><p>In February of this year, as part of its Regional Action Plan for Jobs, the Government announced the provision of additional capital funding of &euro;150 million over 5 years to IDA Ireland to enable it to provides a variety of property solutions designed to win additional projects for the regions outside Dublin and Cork.  These will involve advance buildings, improvements of existing parks, and the acquisition and servicing of suitable sites.  About 30% of the money has been allocated to the construction of nine advance facilities.  One of the new planned advanced building solutions will be in IDA&rsquo;s Dundalk Business and Technology Park.  The design and planning process is due to commence in the fourth quarter of this year.<\/p><p>IDA regularly monitors the market to maintain an awareness of available land and buildings, in the private sector, suitable to FDI.  Finally, the inclusion of Kells in the national Regional Aid Map will further enhance the prospects of attracting new investment and the expansion of existing enterprises, both foreign and indigenous, in County Meath.  Two US companies opened their offices in Kells in November 2014 as a result of the Succeed in Ireland Initiative, which is implemented by Connect Ireland on behalf of IDA Ireland.  <div><b>Table showing the numbers employed in IDA Ireland client companies in County Louth and County Meath each year from 2010 to 2014<\/b><\/div><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>County Louth<\/th><th>County Meath<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>1,322<\/td><td>1,214<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>1,511<\/td><td>1,270<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>1,881<\/td><td>1,204<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>2,568<\/td><td>1,229<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>3,029<\/td><td>1,252<\/td><\/tr><\/table><div><\/p><p><b>Table showing the numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Louth and Meath in each year from 2010 to 2014<\/b><\/div><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>County Louth<\/th><th>County Meath<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>4,885<\/td><td>4,798<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>5,273<\/td><td>5,120<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>5,009<\/td><td>5,368<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>5,032<\/td><td>6,072<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>5,434<\/td><td>6,658<\/td><\/tr><\/table><div><b>Table showing number of IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Louth and County Meath in 2013 and 2014<\/b><\/div><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>County Louth <\/th><th>County Meath <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800067#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800067#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[16607\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800067#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of Enterprise Ireland and Industrial Development Agency jobs created in County Limerick for the years 2011 to 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Industrial Development Agency (IDA) supported businesses in County Limerick for 2011-2014 is set out in Tables 1 and 2.<\/p><p>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.<\/p><p>EI works with over 240 client companies in Limerick City and County who employ 6,321 employees.

In this regard, the question of pensioner groups having access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which careful consideration has been given. <\/p>  <p>  In doing so, it was important to keep in mind that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme.

The purpose of theses meetings was to discuss what the EU and its Member States can do together to alleviate the situation.

We emphasised, as well, the need for increased humanitarian assistance.  The immediate response to humanitarian crises of this nature have to be primarily grounded in the region where the conflict occurs, tackling the issue at its roots.

I appreciate of course the concerns that Father Molloy's family have expressed about the length of time taken to publish the Report, but I had a responsibility to ensure that these matters were properly considered including any legal issues which might arise.  Mr McGinn's report was subsequently published with a number of redactions which were made for legal reasons following consultation with the Attorney General and in agreement with Mr. McGinn.  I can assure the Deputy that the question of the report's publication received active attention at all times and that I published it as soon as it was possible to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The thrust of Mr. McGinn's report has been to shed light on as many issues as possible in order to minimise the number of unanswered questions regarding the case.  While unanswered questions do remain, the report concludes that the precise events surrounding Father Molloy&rsquo;s death cannot now be ascertained.  It concludes that, given the passage of time, the death of many of the pertinent witnesses, and the reluctance of others to give evidence, that it is unlikely any further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.  In these circumstances I have accepted the report's recommendation that examination by a further inquiry would not be warranted.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also recall that the Garda SCRT Review had earlier been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who advised that there be no further prosecution in relation to the case.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is not the outcome that Fr Molloy's family have sought but I hope that putting this amount of information into the public domain regarding the case will be of benefit.  I have indicated to family representatives that I am available to meet with them should they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800069#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800069#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[16246\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800069#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the number of garda&iacute; has been reduced in an area (details supplied) in County Louth in recent years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[16247\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800069#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to increase the number of garda&iacute; stationed at a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":559,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees.

These centres accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).  The provision of PPCI  from three 24\/7 centres in Dublin had proved unsustainable and the decision to consolidate the service into two centres was made following a comprehensive review and reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller number of sites, to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.    <\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS Programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The Programme was also informed by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24\/7 requirements of this service.<\/p>  <p>  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  Following consultation with the National Ambulance Service and with all relevant hospitals, the ACS Programme recommended that there should be two 24\/7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with STEMI.  <\/p>  <p>  The ACS Programme also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital) in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24\/7 PPCI centres, including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.<\/p>  <p>   The designation of PPCI centres outside Dublin is based on the recommendations of the ACS Programme report of 2012 as follows - Cork University hospital (24\/7), University Hospital Waterford (9-5) and Galway University hospital (24\/7).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800071#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Service Waiting Lists","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800071#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[16329\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800071#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Kerry will receive orthodontic treatment.","asker":"1047","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The study acknowledged that Ireland's survival rates have improved consistently in recent years.  However, the period under review largely pre-dates the National Cancer Strategy 2006-2015, the establishment of the National Cancer Control Programme in 2007 and full national coverage by the BreastCheck Screening Programme which commenced in 2007 and CervicalCheck screening programmes which started in 2008.  It is expected that future studies will confirm that survival rates have improved further as a result of these initiatives.   The latest available data from the National Cancer Registry indicates that net survival at five years from diagnosis has increased from 45% for Irish patients diagnosed during 1994-1999 to 59% for patients diagnosed during 2006-2011. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years my Department and the National Cancer Control Programme in the HSE have focused on improving the quality of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion.   We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres.  Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics and Rapid Access Clinics for Lung and Prostate Cancer have been set up in eight designated centres, with a satellite breast unit in Letterkenny.  The HSE has developed early detection and cancer prevention programmes, such as the national hereditary cancer programme for patients and families whose cancer may have a hereditary component.  In addition the HSE provides free screening for Breast, Cervical and Bowel cancer, as well as a HPV vaccination programme which provides protection against cervical cancer.<\/p>  <p>  I am about to establish a Steering Group to provide guidance and advice in the development of the next National Cancer Strategy which will be implemented from 2016.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.<\/p>  <p>  Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used. Anyone who suspects they may have contracted Lyme Disease should consult their GP who will arrange appropriate testing and treatment. <\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health, an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>  -To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;<\/p>  <p>  -To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;<\/p>  <p>  -To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  -To develop strategies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;<\/p>  <p>  -To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>   The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.<\/p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week. This involves raising awareness for clinicians and the general public as to the risks of infected biting ticks, protection against tick bites and identifying the disease. Much use is made of the media to broadcast these messages in addition to the extensive material provided on the HPSC website. This year's Lyme Awareness Week takes place from April 27 to May 1st.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800072#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800072#WRO04900"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[16392\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800072#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a wheelchair in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

Increased emphasis on patient safety in policy reform, legislative changes and development of standards of care driven by quality improvement initiatives underpin the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Service Planning process and specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in both the hospital and community setting. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of HCAIs over many years including, SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland) and the HSE's \"Say No to Infection\" which focused on both HCAIs and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) launched in 2007.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent HSE Healthcare Associated Infection (HCAI) and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Clinical Programme was established in 2010.  The Programme, based within the HSE Quality Improvement Division, has targeted three key areas relating to HCAI\/AMR.<\/p>  <p>  1. Hand Hygiene: achievements include provision of online hand hygiene resources (www.hse.ie\/go\/handhygiene), updating of national hand hygiene guidelines, national specification for alcohol hand gel, and a monthly Key Performance Indicator (KPI) on hand hygiene training for hospital staff.<\/p>  <p>  2. Prudent use of antibiotics ('Antimicrobial Stewardship'): achievements include development of public website for self-care for common infections (www.undertheweather.ie ), guidelines for antibiotic use in primary care and residential care settings (www.antibioticprescribing.ie), annual promotional and educational activities around European Antibiotic Awareness Day, public information campaigns (www.hse.ie\/antibiotics),collaborative project to promote safe use of gentamicin (www.rcpi.ie), and antibiotic care bundles ('Start smart then focus' and 'Right drug, right time, right duration').<\/p>  <p>  3. Medical device-related infections: achievements include update of 2009 National Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular (IV) catheter-associated infection, and guidelines and care bundles for prevention of urinary catheter-associated infections (www.hpsc.ie).<\/p>  <p>  Other activities and achievements include the introduction of new monthly indicators (hospital acquired S. aureus bloodstream infection and C. difficile infection), guidelines for prevention and control of multiple drug-resistant organisms (www.hpsc.ie), and development of infection prevention and control guidelines for primary care (www.icgp.ie).<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carries out unannounced inspections in public acute hospitals to monitor compliance with the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  It focuses in particular on Standard 3: Environmental and Facilities Management and Standard 6: Hand Hygiene with the purpose of assessing hygiene as experienced by patients at any given time.  Other Standards may be observed and reported on if concerns arise during the course of an inspection.  The monitoring inspections commenced in November 2012 and over 100 inspections, including some re-inspections have been carried out to date.  Hospitals must revise and amend their Quality Improvement Plans (QIPs) after monitoring to prioritise the improvements necessary to fully comply with the Standards; the Authority continues to monitor the hospital's progress in implementing its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that Hospital Groups will continue to achieve full implementation of the local Quality Improvement Plans developed following each HIQA visit which will be managed and monitored to ensure hospitals achieve and sustain high standards of hygiene and improved compliance with infection prevention and control standards.<\/p>  <p>  To further support patient care HIQA is also monitoring compliance against the National Standards for Safer, Better Healthcare with a particular focus in 2015 on antimicrobial stewardship and nutrition and hydration of patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800073#WRP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":774,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800073#WRP02150"},{"type":"question","counter":775,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[16444\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800073#WRP02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of early intervention teams in each local health office; the waiting time for assessment in each team; and the numbers on the waiting lists in each case.","asker":"1178","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":776,"content":"<p>All Health Service Executive areas have significant early intervention services in place for children with disabilities aged zero to eighteen years.

","asker":"962","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borreliosis) is an infection transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.<\/p>  <p>  Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used. Anyone who suspects they may have contracted Lyme Disease should consult their GP who will arrange appropriate testing and treatment. <\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>  - To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;<\/p>  <p>  - To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop straegies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;<\/p>  <p>  - To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.<\/p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week.

The view was then taken that this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what would have been only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p>  <p>  Having considered this matter the Government announced in Budget 2014 its decision to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by initially providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  An expert group was subsequently appointed to list illnesses or diseases in order, that is, from those which should be counted first and be provided with coverage to those that would be covered later. The group found it would be unjust, unethical and impractical to create a hierarchy of diseases and a list of illnesses in order stating one was more severe than the next. <\/p>  <p>  The Government chose the under-6s and over-70s as the initial phases for the introduction of a universal GP service simply because they are the youngest and oldest in society and the ones who need to see their GP most often. This service will commence during the summer subject to the passing of the necessary legislation in respect of the over-70s which has now passed Second Stage in this House.

While Future Health sets the broad direction of travel for reforming the system, it was always made clear that an incremental approach to implementation would be taken.

Phase II of the Health Reform Programme, as set out in Future Health, provides for the dissolution and replacement of the HSE with the introduction of a formal purchaser\/provider split, the establishment of a Healthcare Commissioning Agency and a range of provider agencies, including Hospital Trusts.  This is a complex health reform programme and it is essential that the hospital trust legislation is developed as part of the overall process and that the appropriate structures are in place in advance of formal establishment of trusts.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime each Group must develop and produce a strategic plan which will describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services; how they will reorganise these services to provide optimal care possible to the populations they serve; and how they will achieve maximum integration and synergy with other Groups and all other health services, particularly primary care\/community based services.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department (with the assistance of the Strategic Advisory Group on the Implementation of Hospital Groups) will progress the significant body of work necessary to facilitate the transition from Hospital Groups to Trusts.

The Groups and their respective strategic plans will be rigorously reviewed against criteria to test their suitability to proceed to become Hospital Trusts.

This work has also been peer reviewed and is now being finalised by the Health Research Board for submission to its board, in the first instance, and then for formal submission to my Department.

The Council also received a presentation from the High Representative on her intention to carry out a Strategic Review of the European Security Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Council provided an important opportunity for Ministers to discuss the fluid situation on the ground in Libya, and consider how the EU can best respond to the evolving crisis. The Council expressed its continued support for the UN brokered talks on Libya, and the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, Bernardino Le&oacute;n, to reach agreement on a government of national unity and a sustainable ceasefire. Our meeting also discussed what steps the EU could take to support a government of national unity, should the ongoing UN facilitated talks succeed. The issue of migration was dealt with at a separate joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Interior Ministers which took place on 20 April.<\/p>  <p>  The Council had a strategic discussion on the EU's relationship with Latin America and the Caribbean. I took the opportunity to raise the importance which Ireland places on engaging with Latin America, a region with whom we share close ties. I also noted the importance of evolving EU-Latin America cooperation in line with developments in both continents, and continuing to engage with Latin American countries on global issues such as climate change, disarmament, and the post-2015 development agenda. The Council also discussed the major political changes which are taking place in Latin America. These include the process of modernisation in Cuba. We received a report from the High Representative on her recent visit, and an update on the negotiations towards an EU Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement with Cuba. I noted that such an Agreement, which places human rights at its core, will buttress the reform process in Cuba. The Council also welcomed recent advances in Cuba-US relations. Ministers also discussed the peace process in Colombia, and how we can assist in bringing it to a successful and lasting conclusion. I noted the importance of the peace process for the advancement of human rights in Colombia, which is at the centre of our own policy towards Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  Ministers discussed recent developments with regard to negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme. I took the opportunity to welcome the agreement in principle reached between representatives of the international community and the Government of Iran in Lausanne on 2 April, and to urge all responsible parties to support this agreement and the work of their governments to finally bring it to a successful conclusion. I also expressed my appreciation to the High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of the states which participated in the negotiations for the seriousness and intent with which they pursued a diplomatic solution to this difficult issue over a long period, and in particular over the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  The Council engaged in a useful discussion of the deepening crisis in Yemen and the need for all parties to engage with the United Nations so that the Yemeni transition can get back on track. This is urgently needed so that the humanitarian, economic and security crises in the country can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the High Representative made a presentation to the Council regarding her intention to prepare an assessment of the changed global environment for consideration at the European Council in June.  This is the first phase in a process to draft a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy, in full consultation with the Member States.  Given the changes in the international environment since the previous Strategy was prepared in 2003, including the situation on the EU&rsquo;s borders both to the East and the South, it is appropriate that such a review be undertaken and I expressed my support for this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, I participated with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald TD, in an extraordinary joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs Ministers to discuss the issue of migration in the Mediterranean called in response to recent tragic events.

These solutions must address the human safety and organised crime aspects of this crisis. We noted also the importance of addressing the root causes which contribute to the migratory pressures.

Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.<\/p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.

My Department has already begun to progress this commitment, mindful that changes in school autonomy need to be carefully planned and supported if they are to achieve improved educational outcomes for our children. <\/p>  <p>  The skills levels of school leaders and teachers are critical factors in enabling schools to benefit from both existing and any increased levels of school autonomy with regard to school governance, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. The Department has made considerable investment to build the professional competence of school leaders through its support services and through the work of the education partners including the IPPN and NAPD. Developing the leadership skills of principals and deputy principals will be an essential requirement of any plans to increase school autonomy. Equally, the strong focus in current policy development on increasing the skills levels of Irish teachers and driving the professionalism of teaching, evident in the work of the Teaching Council, is important.<\/p>  <p>  We are already moving towards greater autonomy in the area of curriculum and assessment. Work is underway on revised curricula at primary level (the first elements will be introduced in schools in 2015\/2016) which will offer opportunities to provide greater curriculum flexibility to schools. Significant developments have been announced at Junior Cycle that will, over time, increase substantially the autonomy of post-primary schools over curriculum and assessment.  Recently introduced changes to teacher education have seen the lengthening of initial teacher education courses and a shift in course content to place a greater emphasis on skills in pedagogy and assessment. Both of these developments are designed to enhance teachers' capacity to adapt curricula and assessment practices in schools to better suit the needs of students. The proposals of the NCSE regarding the creation of a single pot of SEN-related teaching posts in schools may offer further opportunities for school autonomy. These would provide schools with the greater freedom to allocate and manage staff with required flexibility which is envisaged in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of school self-evaluation in 2012 enables schools themselves to arrive at school-specific information on how well they are doing, which they are expected to use in their planning for improvement. This encourages schools to use their autonomy to prioritise particular learning targets and to make the necessary pedagogical changes to achieve those targets within a broad curriculum and pedagogical framework.<\/p>  <p>  We know that putting appropriate supports in place is a critical step to realising in a fresh way the curriculum, pedagogical, and assessment autonomy that schools currently have and may be given in the future and that is why this work is already underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800078#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":1045,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[16397\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800078#WRU02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to require schools to draw up five-year development plans for their schools and individual teachers; and the way in which they are supported by the inspectorate.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1046,"content":"<p>Since November 2012, schools are required to engage in evidence-based school self-evaluation (SSE) focussed on improving learner outcomes.

The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR20577). The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays. An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise. Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process. The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.<\/p><p>  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process. In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.<\/p><p>  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014. If implemented, the report, which covers 182 employees, would provide for an average annual salary increase of about &euro;9,000 for 115 of the staff concerned. The report found that the remaining 67 staff are on a salary higher than the relevant UCC salary by an average of about &euro;10,000 per annum. Implementation of the report would add in excess of &euro;1,000,000 to the University's annual pay costs.<\/p><p>  However, in January 2015 management in UCC was informed that union members in Tyndall had rejected the report. A conciliation conference was held in the LRC in February during which the unions sought to set aside the already agreed appeals procedure. Management advised that it was adhering to the agreed appeals process brokered by the LRC.

The closing date for the receipt of submissions under the public consultation process is 15 May 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Septic Tank Inspections","counter":1206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1207,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[16637\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX03900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of septic tanks that have been inspected in County Westmeath, since the introduction of legislation requiring registration on 1 February 2013.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1208,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[16638\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of septic tanks that have been registered in County Westmeath.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[16639\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total income to the State, so far, from septic tank registrations.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1210,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[16640\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of septic tanks inspected that have received grant aid to address the issues that came to light from inspections","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1211,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[16641\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total amount provided in grant aid for septic tanks; and if he will provide a breakdown, on a county basis.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1212,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[16642\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"that due to the fact that the National Inspection Plan provided for 1,000 inspections of septic tanks by July 2014, the sanctions against local authorities who fail to meet this target.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1213,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[16643\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800081#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the facility in place for any owner of a septic tank, who suspects a problem, to obtain a local authority inspection; if the local authority are failing to meet the target of the National Inspection Plan.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1214,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 to 431, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>As of 27 April 2015, 11,195 domestic wastewater treatment systems in county Westmeath have been registered.  This represents 92% of the estimated total number of domestic wastewater systems in the county based on Census 2011 data.  The registration fees payable by owners of the domestic waste water treatment systems were collected by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the local authority in which the systems are located.  The fees are intended to meet the costs incurred by the local authorities in maintaining their individual registers and in carrying out the risk-based inspections.  Distribution of fees to individual local authorities is a matter for the LGMA. <\/p><p>The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The <i>National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems<\/i>was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.  Neither I nor my Department have any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the EPA&rsquo;s Plan.  However, the EPA has conducted a review on the implementation of the Plan for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014.  The report contains a breakdown, by county, of inspections that have taken place and includes details relating to non-compliant treatment systems and advisory notices. It is available on the Agency&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s review indicates that 99% of inspections targeted in the Plan&rsquo;s first year were completed by the local authorities, with only two authorities not completing the number of inspections allocated to them (though my Department has been advised that the outstanding inspections have since been completed).  Part 4A of the Water Services Act 2007 (as amended), a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, provides appropriate enforcement powers to the EPA , which is the supervisory body for the purposes of implementation of the National Inspection Plan.<\/p><p>Selection of treatment systems for inspection is carried out by the local authorities using the EPA&rsquo;s IT system which utilises WebGIS information.  The selection system is based on risk criteria such as hydrological and geological conditions, density of one-off housing, proximity to drinking water sources etc.  Householders cannot request inspections of their own treatment systems. <\/p><p>Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the owner of a premises to ensure that their waste water treatment systems are kept so as not to cause, or be likely to cause, a risk to human health or the environment, including waters, the atmosphere, land, soil, plants or animals, or create a nuisance through odours.  The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.  Any person whose treatment system fails an inspection or, in the absence of an inspection, considers that their treatment system constitutes, or may constitute, a risk to human health or the environment is responsible for having any necessary remediation works carried out without delay.<\/p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.  The qualification criteria are set out in the legislation and full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <\/p><p>Responsibility for the administration of my Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme, under which funding is provided to recoup local authorities the grants paid by them in respect of the remediation of domestic waste water treatment systems, is devolved to the local authorities.  Details of the grants recouped by my Department to the local authorities up to 24 April 2015 are set out in the table.  The table does not include details of any grant applications currently being processed by the local authorities or amounts already paid but where recoupment applications have not yet been submitted to my Department. <\/p><p>Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria included in the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013 but wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced under Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.

Nevertheless I have urged, and will continue to urge, local authorities in general to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address failures to comply with statutory requirements, particularly in relation to fire safety in residential developments within their functional areas.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Kildare County Council in its capacity as Fire Authority has previously been engaged with the Owner Management Company and with owners of some individual apartment units in the development concerned to resolve a number of problems that became apparent on and from 2013.

In the event that further action may be required, however, I would advise all owners concerned to cooperate with the Local Authority in carrying out its statutory role. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recourse available for homeowners, the position is that the Building Control Act 1990 places primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder\/developer who carries out the works.

Provisional figures (provided by SEAI) for 2014 indicate that 69.6% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels which are likely to remain a key component of the electricity generation fuel mix in the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Good progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is just under 2,600 MW of which 2,200 MW is wind.  A further 3,700 MW of renewable generation is contracted for connection to the grid, of which almost 3,600 MW is wind generation.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that the total contribution from renewable generation to gross electricity consumption last year was 22.6%.  In addition, wave and tidal energy have the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the medium to longer term.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the European Union's emerging climate and energy targets for 2030, it is likely that all Member States will be required to expand their renewable electricity generation portfolios beyond their 2020 capacities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800083#WRZ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":1307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800083#WRZ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[16782\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800083#WRZ05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which he has received communication from the Irish Postmasters Union in the context of promoting the use of An Post in the future, and identifying suitable opportunities for delivery of complementary and adaptable services, including the utilisation of the network of post offices and sub-post offices, including counter services; the extent to which consideration has been given to suitable and readily adaptable services in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[16812\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800083#WRZ05100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if consideration will be given to recognising the post office network as a national asset, as was done in the United Kingdom, to avoid the need for constant tenders for business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1310,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[16831\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042800083#WRZ05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to carry out a comprehensive review of the post office network, to highlight its benefits and any potential risks to its future sustainability as a national asset for the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1311,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464, 467 and 468 together.<\/p><p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide network of customer focused post offices in the community.<\/p><p>I note the recent publication of the 6-point plan by the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union.

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The Directives have been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Wildlife Acts.  In advance of the designation of a site, my Department writes to all identified land owners with a legal interest in the site, outlining the intention to designate the site, the appeals process and how to get further information.  Public notices in relation to the proposed designation are also placed in local media. <\/p><p>Landowners may object to the proposed designation of a site as a special area of conservation or special protection area.  Following the completion of a departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, landowners may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases.  The appeals process includes an oral hearing.<\/p><p>Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive.  This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. <\/p><p>3,076 applications have been received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation.  Of these, 768 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  In addition, around 1,500 submissions would have been received from stakeholders, including turf cutters, during the public consultation process on the draft National Peatlands Strategy and the draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. <\/p><p>In the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation to non-designated bogs and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. <\/p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.
